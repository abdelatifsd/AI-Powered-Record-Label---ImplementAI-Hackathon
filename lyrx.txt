Didn't you know  
I was waiting on you  
Waiting on a dream  
That'll never come true  
Didn't you know  
I was waiting on you  
My face turned to stone  
When I heard the news  
  
[Chorus]  
When you decide to break the rules  
'Cause I just heard some real bad news  
  
People will talk  
Like its old news  
I played it off and act like I already knew  
Let me ask you  
How long have you known too  
You played it off and act like he's brand new  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Real bad news  
Real bad news  
Real bad news  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep another no you wont  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep it like you never knew  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep another love for you  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep it like you never knew  
  
While I'm waiting on a dream  
That'll never come true  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep it like you never knew  
  
My face turned to stone  
When I heard the news  
  
Whats on the news  
Channel cruise


It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?  
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it  
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted  
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too  
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing  
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on  
With something crazy on my arm  
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds  
  
We outta here baby!  
  
"Dude!" Fresh off the plane, "konichiwa," bitches  
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot  
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it  
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it  
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas  
But only I could come up with some shit like this  
I done played the underdog my whole career  
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year  
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"  
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go  
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo  
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head  
Cause my Dior got me more model head  
I'm insulted, you should go 'head  
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead  
And the flow just hit code red  
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me  
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me  
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me  
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me  
  
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing  
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on  
With something crazy on my arm  
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds  
  
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!  
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!  
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby  
  
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby  
I'm so bright not shady  
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady  
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated  
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan  
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans  
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them  
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy  
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies  
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"  
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit  
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family  
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties  
And I ate it cause I'm so avid  
I don't front and I don't go backwards  
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit  
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch  
  
We outta here baby!  
  
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah  
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing  
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on  
With something crazy on my arm  
Ha Ha Hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds


I know what it's like to feel down little girl  
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up  
No, I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown  
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan  
No plan, a lost man, raisin my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham  
My quest success, but my life was a mess  
Poor Kenny West, no zest, antidepressed  
Not dressed to impress  
Matter fact more stressed  
Than John Mayer waiting on his aids test  
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large  
Took me out of my car  
Now I'm in his garage  
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration  
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian  
My game was timid now my flow much bolder  
Got a chubby brown angel sittin on my shoulder, sayin  
(Girl singing)  
You know, it don't matter what you do  
Cuz I'll always be there for you  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Grow a mustache  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Slap your wife's ass  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Never smoke grass  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Really pass gas  
Be-Cleve in yourself! Goodnight!


(featuring Common)  
(Hook)  
My raps is better than yours  
My plaques is better than yours  
My tracks is better than yours  
You can have one but I have to charge  
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb  
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold  
Then I will have the qualm, I-I-I-I'm  
I'm Kan the Louis Vuitton Don  
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom  
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on  
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard  
Oh my God is that a black card?  
I turned around and replied why yes,  
But I prefer the term African-American Express  
(Hook)  
La La La La La Off MTV  
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me  
Brains, power and muscle like Dame, Puffy and Russell  
Your boy back on his hustle, don't know you don't discuss you  
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work  
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts  
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts  
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts  
There's something I might say, There's something I might play  
A beat I might make might make they life change  
And save their whole deal, Their wrist is on chill  
They house is on hill, You could be Lauren Hill  
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on  
I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on  
Man I'm just sayin  
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin  
Now you just prayin  
(Hook)  
[Common]  
You was a vic in high school now you a thug  
Better step in the name of love  
Before you giving pain a hug  
Needing dope is like pain to drugs  
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged  
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords  
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it  
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice  
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night  
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice  
I'm on point like I speak to dice  
Took the underground at a steeper heights  
May real niggaz see the light got fat girls eating right  
  
[Outro]  
Ha ha we in this bitch  
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggaz know what time it is  
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters What Up?  
Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff  
Foreal(Pharrell) That's my favorite producer by the way  
That's why I had to rap on this 'cause  
His tracks is Better Than Yours  
My tracks is Better Than Yours  
Just Blaze tracks is Better Than Yours  
You can have one but we all gonna

That's all  
  


Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me  
I don't want you, but I need you,  
I love you and I hate you at the very same time  
  
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad  
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said  
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says  
God talk to me now this is an emergency  
  
And she claim she only with me for the currency,  
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery  
  
And I was to proud to admit that it was hurtin me  
I'd never do that to you at least purposely  
  
We breakin up again we makin up again  
But we don't love no more  
I guess we fuckin then  
  
Have you ever felt like you wanted to kill her  
And you mixed them emotions with tequilla  
  
And you mixed that with a little bad advice  
On one of them bad nights  
You have a bad fight  
  
And you talkin bout her family her aunts and shit  
And she sayin muhfucka yo mama's a bitch  
You know domestic drama and shit  
  
All the attitude  
Ill never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you  
  
But I'm a be the bigger man  
Big pimpin like jigga man  
Oh I figure it's  
  
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me  
I don't want you, but I need you,  
I love you and I hate you at the very same time  
  
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad  
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said  
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says  
God talk to me now this is an emergency  
  
And my nigga says I shouldn't let her worry me  
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently  
But I've been thinking and it got me back to sinking it  
This relationship, it even got me back to drinking now  
  
This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me  
  
And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny  
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually  
Cause every time that I try you will question me  
Say "you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me?  
You don't see how your lies are affecting me?  
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?  
And I never let a nigga get that close to me!  
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be!  
You always gone! You always be where them hoes would be! "  
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me!  
I fucked up and I know it G  
I guess it's bittersweet poetry


I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'  
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'  
Y'all work at ibm, hotels they be in  
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique, any street  
  
If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress  
  
Father is the black Bruce Wayne, only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains  
  
Tryna hand feed us tell the niggas to anty up  
We not off no more, pearlies in a show, fur  
So pick your auntie up, I gotta run to that pole


(feat. Ludacris)  
[Hook: Ludacris]  
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out  
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out  
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in, breathe out  
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"  
[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap  
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)  
But is it cool to rap about gold  
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)  
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack  
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack  
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant  
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again  
And it's still about the Benjamins  
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms  
Strippers named Cinnamon  
More chips than Pentium  
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is  
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks  
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"  
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?  
What the hell was wrong with me dog?  
Sing along with my y'all  
[Hook: Ludacris]  
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out  
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out  
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in, breathe out  
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"  
[Verse 2: Kanye West]  
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick  
I always had a Ph. D.: a Pretty Huge dick  
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like


La la la la  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
  
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven  
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace  
I told God I'd be back in a second  
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless  
To whom much is given, much is tested  
Get arrested, guess until he get the message  
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny  
And what'd I do? Act more stupidly  
Bought more jewelry, More Louis V.  
My mama couldn't get through to me  
The drama, people suing me  
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me  
I'm just saying how I feel man  
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman  
I guess the money should've changed them  
I guess I should've forgot where I came from  
  
La la la la  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you can't tell me nothing right?  
Excuse me, is you saying something?  
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing  
You can't tell me nothing  
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing  
  
Let up the suicide doors  
This is my life homie, you decide yours  
I know that Jesus died for us  
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars  
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways  
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day  
But homie, this is my day  
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?  
No I already graduated  
And you can live through anything if Magic made it  
They say I talk with so much emphasis  
Ooh, they so sensitive  
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen  
Then say something where you gon end up apolog'in  
Let me know if it's a problem then  
A'ight man, holla then  
  
La la la la  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you can't tell me nothing right?  
Excuse me, is you saying something?  
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing  
You can't tell me nothing  
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing  
  
Let the champagne splash  
Let that man get cash, let that man get past  
You don't need to stop to get gas  
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes  
Cause how he move in a room full of No's?  
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?  
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul  
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold  
Treasure, what's you pleasure?  
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her  
So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada  
I'm in between, but way more fresher  
But way less effort, cause when you try hard  
That's when you die hard  
Ya'll homies lookin' like "Why God?"  
When they reminisce over you, my God  
  
La la la la  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you can't tell me nothing right?  
Excuse me, is you saying something?  
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing  
You can't tell me nothing  
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing  
  
La la la la  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
La la la la  
Then you can't tell me nothing right?


You might think you've peeped the scene  
You haven't  
The real one is far to mean  
The wattered down, the one you know  
Was made up centuries ago  
They it sound all wack and corny  
Yes its awful blasted boring  
Twisted fiction, sick addiction  
Well gather round children  
Zip it listen!  
  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I fantasized about this back in Chicago  
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago  
That's me, the first year that I blow  
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo  
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo  
Me found bravery in my bravado  
D.J's need to listen to the model's  
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?  
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)  
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?  
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow  
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo  
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow  
  
Can we get much higher?  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion  
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis  
Beyond the truest  
Hey, teacher, teacher  
Tell me how do you respawn the students?  
And refresh the page and restart the memory?  
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?  
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies  
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me  
The plan was to drink until the pain over  
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?  
Fresh air, rolling down the window  
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low  
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh  
Don't make me pull the toys  
And fire up the engines huh  
And then they make noise  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
At the mall there was a seance  
Just kids, no parents  
Then the sky filled with heroines  
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron  
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us  
(And the fires did declare us)  
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)  
(And moved her back in Paris)  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


I love it though  
I love it though  
  
Uh put your hands to the constellations  
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation  
I know I'm preaching to the congregation  
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan  
  
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting  
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation  
  
May the Lord forgive us  
May the God's be with us  
And that magic hour  
I seen good Christians  
Make brash decisions  
Oh she do it,  
What happened to Religion?  
Oh she lose it  
She putting on her make up  
She casually allure  
Text message break up, the casualty of tour  
How she gone wake up and not love me no more  
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off  
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme  
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a jumbotron  
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wantedt, huh?"  
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime  
  
Put your hands to the constellations  
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation  
I know I'm preaching to the congregation  
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan  
  
(Satan, Satan, Satan)  
  
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting  
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation  
  
When the sun go down its the magic hour  
The magic hour  
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies  
You got green on your mind  
I can see it in your eyes  
Why you standing there with your face screwed up  
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up  
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up  
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us  
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat  
I ordered you jerk, she said "you are what you eat"  
You see I always loved your sense of humor  
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was  
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie  
The crib Scarface couldn't be more Tony  
You love me for me could you be more phoney  
  
Uh put your hands to the constellations  
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation  
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening  
Cat got your tongue?  
  
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone  
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone  
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along  
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own  
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character  
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender  
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders  
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired  
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder  
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter  
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad  
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag  
Therefore G.4's at the Clearport  
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy  
When it came to dope I was quick to export  
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport  
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport  
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud  
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from  
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne  
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms  
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns  
I shed a tear before the nights over  
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh  
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over  
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller  
I'm makin' love to the angel of death  
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps


We the cause of all the commotion  
Your mouth running, but where is you going?  
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent  
What is you talking, man? That ain't important  
Illuminati, High society  
We in this party and nobody invited me  
We going crazy and I always use my best sense  
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince  
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and  
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and  
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and  
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre  
You just look stupid to be ignoring  
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium  
And parties at Richie is getting risky  
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me  
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed  
Ah, get out my fucking head  
It's just me and my bad bitch  
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt  
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with  
Before I betray them I slit my wrists  
At the top is just us nigga  
Cause I don't really trust niggas  
And we made it through the hurricane  
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane  
We gon' make it, that's on everything  
Truest girls get half naked, every spring  
They saying, "Hey Kanye  
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"  
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain  
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break  
On the radio, man I miss myself  
I need to just step back and kiss myself  
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt  
A little lower.. that's what's up  
Somebody pour her another cup  
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?  
I swear until my time is up  
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck  
  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Palms rise to the universe  
As we moonshine and molly  
Feel the warmth we'll never die  
We're like diamonds in the sky  
You're a shooting star I see  
A vision of ecstasy  
When you hold me I'm alive  
We're like diamonds in the sky  
  
I knew that we'd become one right away  
Oh right away  
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays  
I saw the life inside your eyes  
  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shining bright like a diamond  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
Shine bright like a diamond  
So shine bright tonight you and I  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Eye to eye so alive  
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky  
Shine bright like a diamond


[Pharrell]  
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?  
The muthaf-cking skateboard P  
Knowing that your mee lo  
Playing games like you're cee-lo  
In a tight situation like speedo's  
You can have it your way like Carlito  
My n-gga will be happy to give you torpedos  
And have you car twisted like a blunt  
For you faggot a-s n-ggas that like to front  
I'm on some bbc bape sh-t  
I'm on some cake sh-t  
In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron  
You hating and you want to erase it  
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it  
My flow interupts your homeostasis  
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis  
You talk street sh-t it sound like sweet sh-t  
Straight liquorice you n-ggas sound ticklish  
80k large for the Hermes dream  
Coke n crop in all your magazines  
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine  
Dion, me and my n-ggas like frion  
You b-tches on my pecan b-tch  
She got an a-s you can eat on  
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton  
I hit it til I could seat on  
Try to get her freak on  
Ask me to are Kelly ya and get pee'd on  
I said it aint me maam  
That 8 behind me still got the burner  
Yes the enzo is stilll black like Sojourner  
Truth, I mighta just loosened a tooth  
Spittin' what I did in the booth  
I'm out, pooof!  
[Lupe Fiasco]  
Carrera, raised in a teenage mutant ninja turtle era  
Waanna bear n tell the truth, I dare ya  
Ya lie, so eat these whole bottle of these jalapeno peppers  
For terror made in america too live  
F-ck the property or give me my props properly  
High off life this high technology, Devry  
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology  
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived  
So gimme that, gimme that, keep going  
Where my city at, I'm like steak and fries but never die  
They wanna Ghostface wanna be me  
But they will post haste follow me into the after life  
That means you going right after I've  
But I'm the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow  
So some way some how I have survived  
Who is he that we see coming over the tides  
In a speed boat, boat load of pride  
Full of rum, dress shirted and mastermind tie  
He what happens when rappping and fashion collide  
So omg is the "C" from the C-are-S lol'ing at you haters  
[Kanye West]  
Yes, mr West turn that new child rebel  
Loud as a badass child level  
Who need a chorus we through with a tyrannosaurus  
Tyrone it's been a year with no phone  
Could you explain how high is your zone  
We'll take the plane rub his nose in cocaine  
There's hoes in magazines you lame sayin you lame  
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants  
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France  
Diamonds blue, business manager's Jewish  
And if I get sued my lawyers Jews  
Some girls do, grab the cojones  
Say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra Loan-us  
Brand new ferrari's I gotta make the donuts  
C-are-S is like a hip hop Chris's bonus  
N-ggas is hating on the internet I couldn't tell  
I was too busy rapping good as hell  
I was too busy flying, parasail!  
Tell collect to get the new sh-t that Paris sell  
Tarantino, Da Vinche, gettin' Benji's, get half off Fendi  
Half of that's to Cindy's  
Hoped out the spaceship on my Mork and Mindy  
Popped too many corks to let you dork's offend me  
Props in New York but Chi town's the city  
Get my city hoochie's Gucci, Monica Bellucci's  
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendi's?  
I'm so ultra I'm even over Oprah  
But let me check your account, haha no sir  
Don't stop, don't stop...


You got to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
All day long man, we back in town  
  
[Consequence]  
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized  
So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy  
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid  
And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige  
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay  
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say  
  
[Kanye West]  
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam  
And where the glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams  
See I showed you on the champions how we get down  
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown  
You got B2k on all your bedroom wall  
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls  
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets  
The top three in the game, with these here beats  
  
[Consequence]  
And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out  
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth  
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight  
But y'all niggaz don't shine so you couldn't relate  
  
[Chorus:]  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (You couldn't relate)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yo Quence, you couldn't relate)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
  
[Consequence]  
Quence without the game, now he's back to ball  
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall  
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long  
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon  
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip  
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks  
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy  
  
[Kanye West]  
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy  
The G-500 is my favorite toy  
'Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood  
But he keep dem gorilla's so we still be good  
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A  
And the N-Y-E, out N. Y. C  
I'ma still rep the gold, no matter where I go  
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold  
Hate when niggaz leave the city and switch up they reps  
On the real homie, I don't get down like that  
I'ma milk the game, 'til we all can eat  
  
[Consequence]  
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep  
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak  
'Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks  
  
[Kanye West]  
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show  
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough  
Then fake a pregnancy, then call the attorney-a  
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than ikea furniture  
  
[Consequence]  
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D  
Menace, Skates to Lou and 'em Puffs from L. B  
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice  
'Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice  
Ey shorty let me tell you 'bout the rules of my Nikes  
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice  
  
[Chorus:]  
So relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Calm down)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (It's the are. O. C.!)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uhh)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uh-huh, yeah)  
All day long man, we back in town  
  
[Repeat 'til end]  
Relax yaself or we'll whack ya down


You're so hypnotizing  
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel  
Your touch magnetizing  
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing  
  
They say be afraid  
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers  
Different DNA, they don't understand you  
  
You're from a whole other world  
A different dimension  
You open my eyes  
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light  
  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me, t-t-take me  
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial  
  
You're so supersonic  
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers  
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic  
  
You're from a whole other world  
A different dimension  
You open my eyes  
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light  
  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison  
Take me, t-t-take me  
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial  
  
There is this transcendental, on another level  
Boy, you're my lucky star  
I wanna walk on your wave length  
And be there when you vibrate  
For you I risk it all, all  
  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me, t-t-take me  
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial  
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial  
  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial


Damn, here we go again  
Common passed on this beat  
I made it to a jam  
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce'  
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey  
Remember him from blackstreet  
He was as black as the street was  
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was  
I never could see why people'll reach a  
Fake-ass versad that they couldn't keep up  
Ya see how I creeped up?  
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?  
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam  
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am  
Let me know if you feel it man  
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everybody sayin' what's not for him  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
And I'm back to tear it up  
Haters, start your engines  
I hear 'em gearin' up  
People talkin' so much shit about me at barbershops  
They forget to get their haircut  
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up  
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough  
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos  
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows  
So say goodbye to the N-double-A-C-P award  
Goodbye to the India Arie award  
They'd rather give me the nigga-please award  
But I'll just take the I-got-a-lot a-cheese award  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this  
But I got the facts to back this  
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets  
Man, killin's some wack shit  
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'  
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?  
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin  
I need to talk to somebody, pastor  
The church want time, so I can't afford to pay  
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay  
My 15 seconds up, but I got more to say  
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today  
  
Damn, here we go again  
Everybody sayin' what's not for him  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am  
  
Damn, here we go again  
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan  
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am


Jamie Fox, featuring Kanye West  
  
First Verse:  
  
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out  
Tired of being cramped up in the house  
We were simply celebrating life  
Off from work today, so it's all right  
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist  
Started dancing with this model chick  
Then every record became our favorite song  
And that is all that I remember  
  
Chorus:  
  
Cuz I had one too many drinks  
And ended up at the Embassy  
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee  
It was a one night extravaganza  
  
Second Verse:  
  
When I woke up from last night's "salvatry"  
Baby doll was laying next to me  
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where  
I got dress and got up out of there  
But not before I call for me a cab  
Hung over from all the drinks I had  
And now I'm telling my story to you  
Every thing that I remember  
  
Repeat Chorus: 2x  
  
Bridge:  
  
Extravaganza, Extravaganza  
Only was an extravaganza  
Yes, it was  
The things that I remember  
  
Kanye West's Rap:  
(And I remember)  
Being at the bar  
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'  
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'  
Here's a broke nigga trick  
Buy one bottle and sip slow  
Or, or leave the club now  
Do like I did  
Come back when you get dough  
A fish stick nigga  
Now we messing with lobsters  
We messing with Grammies  
We messing with Oscars  
You messing with that dranky drank  
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank  
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank  
The hotel said that y'all was on one  
My girl wasn't on shit  
I picked the wrong one  
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls  
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls  
Bring they own rubber girl  
Neva meet 'cha mother girl  
You know they love it, when you love them  
And they tell they friends, girrrllllll  
  
Repeat Chorus: 2x  
  
Ad libs:  
Kanye West - "You know, they're going to blame it on the drink"  
"You know, that's just an excuse to do exactly what you want to do."  
"J. Fox, Kanye to the"  
"And the winners are"  
"That's BSP, baby"  
"There's a lot of Black Star Power in the room right now"  
"Easy" "Easy" "Be very easy"  
"Calm down, please"


This is family business  
And this is for the family that can't be with us  
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us  
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet  
Like a photo of your granny's picture  
Now that you're gone it hit us  
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right  
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life  
Somebody please say grace so I can save face  
And have a reason to cover my face  
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it  
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it  
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?  
As kids we used to laugh  
Who knew that life would move this fast?  
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?  
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it  
And if you did, then that's family business  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
This is family business  
And this is for everybody standin' with us  
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture  
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?  
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"  
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it  
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite  
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider  
But when we get together be electric slidin'  
Grandma, get 'em shook up  
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up  
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name  
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane  
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude  
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food  
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins  
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins  
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins  
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all  
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg  
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed  
  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
  
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind  
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns  
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God  
And keep your face to the risin' sun  
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog  
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog  
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog  
You can still love your man and be manly dog  
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'  
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman  
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?  
The second she storms out then he storms in  
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion  
And drink some wine like Communion  
And act like everything fine and if it isn't  
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business  
  
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
They don't mean a thing  
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing, a thing  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
All these things


(Ad libs)

You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match  
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch  
I got my business manager erasing my debt  
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit  
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it  
My girl come over try to help me shine  
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine  
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line  
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying  
You better grow up before I blow up  
Have weed rolled up when I show up  
Matter fact we broke as fuck  
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up  
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend  
So I promise to never pick up smutts  
In my Cadillac pick-up truck  
They need to get they sit-ups up  
They always be colder than you  
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you  
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels  
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college  
So you can be where they at two years from now  
But for now bartender two beers for now  
The second one is for my girlfriend  
  
[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my
girlfriend  
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my
boyfriend  
  
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such  
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch  
Greater man could prob picture like there go us  
No styles just good times like they're so nuts  
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much  
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch  
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon  
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room  
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom  
That I call my lair  
We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz  
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend

Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay  
  
Maybe it's cause she into Leos  
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio  
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold  
Better bring your ski clothes, peeking through the keyhole  
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now  
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down  
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka  
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka  
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted  
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka  
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba  
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa  
On to the next saga  
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her  
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca  
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka  
  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay  
  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan  
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer  
  
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray  
None ah dem have the guts to bust the AK  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
Let me go, let me go, let me go  
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?  
Let me go  
  
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

(Mr. West) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah  
  
And I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way  
So this is in the name of love, like a rob would say  
Before you ask me to get a job today,  
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?  
And I know the Government administered AIDS  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars  
Things we seen on the screen are not ours  
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars  
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars  
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it  
  
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a
way  
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only
way)  
  
They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'  
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'  
And Jesus, one day that ya see him  
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'  
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'  
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us  
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down  
Now my 'lil cousin smokin' those cigarettes now  
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now  
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?  
I can't figure it out, I'm stickin' around  
  
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a
way  
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only
way)  
  
Cause every worthless word we got more far away,  
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,  
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe,  
It hurts but it may be the only way


Feat. GLC  
[Kanye West]  
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life  
  
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit  
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit  
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation  
I was really makin' myself, they competition  
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game  
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains  
Just picture man, no snitchin' man  
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man  
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave  
'Til I pulled out my map  
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas  
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more  
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed  
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game  
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid  
All my niggas about to have it made  
This makes everything else sound played  
Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!  
Now hold up  
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog  
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)  
I told dude "You can't even rap on my interlude"  
Now does that make me as rude as you?  
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'  
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion  
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion  
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks  
And let's not even bring up the tracks man  
Nope, nope, let's not do that man  
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man  
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs  
  
[Chorus: Kanye West]  
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life  
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up  
Throw your diamonds  
  
Let the beat ride out for a minute  
  
[GLC (Kanye West)]  
Let's take it there, take it there man  
It's not supposed to be...  
(GLC where you at nigga?)  
  
How many niggas you know put their life on the line and get signed  
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime  
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count  
How could I mic out, just look at my account  
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all  
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'  
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'  
When I copied hounds it was my best investment  
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson  
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses  
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants  
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy  
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'  
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard  
Man look at your haircut  
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks  
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters  
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter  
Even did it on his crime picture and ye  
And offers to sell and yell, uh  
  
[Chorus: Kanye West]


I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
I met this girl when I was 3 years old  
And what I loved most she had so much soul  
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me  
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"  
And from that point I never blow her off  
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off  
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off  
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft  
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown  
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding  
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be  
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave  
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me  
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me  
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me  
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
Maybe we can start again  
  
But if you really cared for her  
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams  
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her  
It always seems like she talking 'bout me  
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you  
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you  
But they just not you" and I just got through  
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new  
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong  
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone  
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home  
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home  
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud  
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud  
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around  
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!  
  
I'm coming home again  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Do you think about me now and then?  
Cause I'm coming home again  
  
Maybe you, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan  
Oh, now I'm coming home again  
Maybe you, do you remember when?  
Fireworks at Lake Michigan  
Oh, now I'm coming home again  
Maybe we can start again


Order, huh  
Yo, we at war  
We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves  
  
(Jesus Walks)  
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down  
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)  
  
You know what the Midwest is?  
Young and Restless  
Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace  
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus  
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is  
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is  
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless  
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard  
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method  
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us  
Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"  
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?  
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases  
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis  
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us  
Well Mama, I know I act a fool  
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope  
  
(Jesus Walks)  
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down  
(Jesus Walks with me)  
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)  
(Jesus Walks)  
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs  
(Jesus Walks with me)  
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long  
(I want Jesus)  
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down  
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now  
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs  
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so
long  
  
So long  
(Jesus Walks with me)  
  
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers  
(Jesus walks for them)  
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah  
(Jesus walks for them)  
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly  
I know He hear me when my feet get weary  
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct  
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think  
I ain't here to argue about his facial features  
Or here to convert atheists into believers  
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers  
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus  
So here go my single dog radio needs this  
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus  
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape  
But if I talk about God my record won't get played  
Huh?  
Well let this take away from my spins  
Which will probably take away from my ends  
Then I hope this take away from my sins  
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about  
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out  
  
(Jesus Walks)  
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down  
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)  
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now


Til the casket drops  
Third times a charm right?  
Ha ha, come on!  
  
I'm kinda like a big deal  
It's unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills  
The flow runnin' on Big's heels  
My life after death, Big ain't get to see how this feels!  
Third time's a charm baby  
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby  
It's a blessin' to blow a hundred thou' in a recession  
With no second guessin'  
Ha ha we're ballin, drop tops we're floorin'  
Champagne we're pourin'  
Re-up is the gang and I'm all in!  
To the powder and the flame I have fallin'  
Get money, blow money is my callin'  
Yugch! Watch a nigga burn through it  
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it  
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it  
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!  
  
They whisperin' about us  
I know you haters doubt us  
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'  
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal  
  
Ay yo I'm sittin' on top of the  
It's more than a feeling ain't it?  
I be killin' damn it, I'm illin' I'm illin'  
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular  
Go get your binoculars  
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be  
Spittin' fire on the P-J in my P-J's  
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like T-J  
Y'all ain't peep? I said Marshall's we play  
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay  
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, had it made  
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed  
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class  
But she got that dumb ass  
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast  
What happen Tisha, your boyfriend cum fast?  
Turn around gimme pound like we folks  
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes  
  
They whisperin' about us  
I know you haters doubt us  
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'  
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal  
  
Lights, cameras, action!  
The chain itself's a damn distraction!  
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in  
I bee hop in the ring, niggas ya cash in  
It's like stoppin' a train,  
Nigga think he's stoppin' my reign  
Talk slick while droppin' my name?  
I'm puttin' y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand  
50 percent splits I ex out the middle man  
A far cry from a stash in the rental van  
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan  
Ladies and gentle-man, introducin'  
The C-4-S with the rims protrudin'  
The roof vamoose, like a magic show  
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw  
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe  
But just as you reap, so shall you so  
  
They whisperin' about us  
I know you haters doubt us  
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'  
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal


Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost  
For making me do this shit motherfucker  
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room  
Cause they don't fucking  
  
(I'd like to propose a toast)  
(I said toast motherfucker)  
  
And I am  
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky  
This is the last call for alcohol, for the  
So get your ass up off the wall  
  
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac  
The Rudolph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc  
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame  
And come back next year with the whole fucking game  
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top  
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop  
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself  
Rocafella's only niggas that help  
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair  
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here  
They say he bourgie, he big-headed  
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is  
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds  
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas  
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested  
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus  
  
And I am  
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky  
This is the last call for alcohol, for the  
So get your ass up off the wall  
  
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir  
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir  
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest  
But all they got left is this guy called West  
Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def  
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z  
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh  
It come out sweeter than old Sadie  
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards  
Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards  
And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye  
I'm almost Raymond'  
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?  
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him  
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine  
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme  
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem  
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams  
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed  
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh  
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more  
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more  
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more  
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga  
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don  
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom  
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards  
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars  
I went to the malls and I balled too hard  
'Oh my god, is that a black card?'  
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term  
African American Express  
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell  
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to  
Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit  
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips  
  
And I am  
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky  
This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas  
So get your ass up off the wall

I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday  
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it  
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit  
Yeah I've been broke  
Now I'm good bitch  
I ain't no Kennedy  
But I'm hood rich  
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto  
And everybody else, thank you very little  
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path  
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past  
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last  
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though  
We needed cash  
And we need it fast  
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last  
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white  
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white  
Almost  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Niggaz wanna diss K  
On they're local mix-tapes  
There they go again, lyin' to consumers  
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors  
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya  
A little arrogant with all your compares  
'Cause as far as the Chi  
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap  
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that  
Y'all just talk about my dough  
How I left Chicago  
How I'm the only one eatin'  
Shut your pie hole  
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though  
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro  
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?  
Only difference between you and me, you were gay  
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?  
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways  
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way  
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v  
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway  
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay  
We stay 4 stars, all better  
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather  
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better  
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas  
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial  
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's  
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg  
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg  
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg  
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
I did it my way  
  


My momma was raised in the era when  
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin  
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help  
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself  
You see it's broke nigga racism  
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"  
And this rich nigga racism  
That's that "Come in, please buy more  
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?  
All you blacks want all the same things"  
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing  
Spending everything on Alexander Wang  
New Slaves  
  
You see there's leaders and there's followers  
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower  
  
You see there's leaders and there's followers  
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower  
  
I throw these Maybach keys  
I wear my heart on the sleeve  
I know that we the new slaves  
I see the blood on the leaves  
I see the blood on the leaves  
I see the blood on the leaves  
I know that we the new slaves  
I see the blood on the leaves  
They throwing hate at me  
Want me to stay at ease  
Fuck you and your corporation  
Y'all niggas can't control me  
I know that we the new slaves  
I know that we the new slaves  
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out  
I'm going Bobby Boucher  
I know that pussy ain't free  
You niggas pussy, ain't me  
Y'all throwing contracts at me  
You know that niggas can't read  
Throw 'em some Maybach keys  
Fuck it, c'est la vie  
I know that we the new slaves  
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me  
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye  
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye  
I'll move my family out the country  
So you can't see where I stay  
So go and grab the reporters  
So I can smash their recorders  
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit  
Like the New World Order  
Meanwhile the DEA  
Teamed up with the CCA  
They tryna lock niggas up  
They tryna make new slaves  
See that's that privately owned prisons  
Get your piece today  
They prolly all in the Hamptons  
Braggin' 'bout what they made  
Fuck you and your Hampton house  
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse  
Came on her Hampton blouse  
And in her Hampton mouth  
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up  
I'm 'bout to tear shit down  
I'm 'bout to air shit out  
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?  
  
I won't end this high, not this time again  
So long, so long, so long  
You cannot survive  
And I'm not dying  
And I can't lose  
I can't lose  
No, I can't lose  
Cause I can't leave it to you  
So let's get too high, get too high again  
(Too high again  
Too high)


Yeezy season approaching  
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing  
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing  
A monster about to come alive again  
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz  
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons  
Take my number and lock it in  
Indian hair, no moccasins  
It's too many hoes in this house of sin  
Real nigga back in the house again  
Black Timbs all on your couch again  
Black dick all in your spouse again  
And I know she like chocolate men  
She got more niggas off than Cochran, huh?  
  
On sight, on sight  
  
How much do I not give a fuck?  
Let me show you right now before you give it up  
How much do I not give a fuck?  
Let me show you right now before you give it up  
  
He'll give us what we need  
It may not be what we want  
  
Baby girl tryna get a nut  
And her girl tryna give it up  
Chopped em both down  
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown  
One last announcement  
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncing  
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain  
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain  
That when David Grutman kicked her out  
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth  
  
On sight, on sight  
  
Uh-huh  
Right now, I need right now  
Right now, I need, I need right now  
Right now, I need, I need right now


[Chorus: Twista]  
And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught  
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought  
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court  
'Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought  
[Verse One: Ludacris]  
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days  
'Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage  
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage  
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage  
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em  
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em  
Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm hustler, baller, pro  
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes  
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their
toes  
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's  
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro  
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking  
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating  
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high  
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!  
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good  
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood  
Would, could, and should break a nigga off  
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)  
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home  
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"  
[Chorus:]  
[Verse Two: Twista]  
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk  
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the
trunk  
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get
pumped  
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk  
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze  
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi  
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage  
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci  
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck  
Want to get me for the wood  
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up  
We can get into it and if you want to do it  
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this  
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury  
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'  
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me  
Got into thinking it's a game  
And whether you in my city and I talk shit  
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name  
I've been known to handle my business  
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat
pilla  
Murder haters that I'm full of  
Niggaz claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas  
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene  
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003  
(Throw it up if you...)  
[Chorus:] - 2X


I know it's past visiting hours  
But can I please give her these flowers?  
The doctor don't wanna take procedures  
He claim my heart can't take the anaesthesia  
It'll send her body into a seizure  
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin  
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words  
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?  
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'  
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'  
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in  
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid  
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS  
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away  
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA  
Right now she'd be okay? But since she  
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years  
Things 'sposed to stop right here  
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong  
That's where I get my confidence from  
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"  
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"  
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?  
You don't see that we hurt? But still  
  
I, smile, when roses come to see me  
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)  
Can't wait for the clouds to break  
  
They outside of the emergency room  
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat  
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon  
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep  
My momma say they say she could pass away any day  
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?  
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt  
Cousin Kim took off of work  
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean  
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team  
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"  
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam  
I think we at a all-time high  
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive  
Cause with my family we know we know where home is  
And so instead of sendin flowers, we the roses  
  
I, smile, when roses come to see me  
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)  
Can't wait for the clouds to break  
  
It brings the sunshine, oh  
  
I, smile, when roses come to see me  
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)  
Can't wait for the clouds to break  
  
I, smile, when Rosey come to see me  
And I'm sad, when Rosey goes away  
Oh Rosey brings the sunshine (say)  
  
Can't wait, I can't wait, no  
Can't wait, I can't wait, no  
Can't wait, I, can't wait  
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day  
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break  
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm  
Oh oh oh oh no no, say  
Tellin' you the truth now  
Said I can't wait, uh uh  
I won't wait, no


The storm is on the horizon  
I'm standing here alone  
Got a pistol on my hip  
And it's gonna be some shit  
If you want it then bring it on  
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier  
And I'mma be here till it's done  
And when they asking who I'm is, shit  
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)  
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)  
Tell them that I'm the one

Yeah, I'm the one, baby  
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby  
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately  
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby  
You on a run, baby  
You on a run, baby  
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby  
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?  
Mm hm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby  
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit  
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick  
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt  
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan, Michael Phelps  
Yeah, had to take it to another realm  
'Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed  
Best way to describe my position is at the helm  
Best way to describe my new whip, yeeuum!  
  
The storm is on the horizon  
I'm standing here alone  
Got a pistol on my hip  
And it's gonna be some shit  
If you want it then bring it on  
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier  
And I'mma be here 'til it's done  
And when they asking who I'm is, shit  
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)  
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)  
Tell them that I'm the one  
  
I told Detroit I'ma fuckin' get it  
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'  
Ye told me I'm the man for the job  
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'  
Started off in that Chevrolet,  
But it's Ferrari's I gotta drive I'm on HBO with my entourage,  
I'm 5'9' fuck a 9 to 5 I need a hundred million no compromise  
I'm a double X L nigga,  
Magazine and condom size see what I seen and be traumatized  
I don't wait, I marinate, variate erryday  
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade  
My weed loud I need a hearing aid  
Livin' life behind a pair of shades  
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar  
For all the bullshit that I hear a day, I did it  
  
The storm is on the horizon  
I'm standing here alone  
Got a pistol on my hip  
And it's gonna be some shit  
If you want it then bring it on  
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier  
And I'mma be here till it's done  
And when they asking who I'm is, shit  
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)

Treat the back seat like a sofa bed  
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit share  
This some good shit, but it get better  
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater  
Like my verse suede and the beat leather  
Just tryin' to stay above sea level  
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"  
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci  
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags  
I shouldn't have bought it all  
I should've went and cut the grass  
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face  
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face  
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag  
Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast  
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game  
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player  
  
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind  
And then I found peace it was really kind,  
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right  
I've been honest the whole time  
  
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind  
And then I found peace it was really kind,  
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right  
I've been honest the whole time


[Chorus]  
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?  
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would  
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could  
But (You make me smile)  
  
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?  
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three  
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us  
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs  
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious  
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush  
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming
over  
Cause its never over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show  
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow  
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go  
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed  
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose  
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose  
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming
over  
'Cause its ne-never over  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(You make me smile with my heart)  
  
I just wanted to ask you  
Just wanted to um  
Let how would I put this uhh  
Let's say all your friends  
Remember the one  
You said if you ever she would be the one  
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)  
I was thinking, hypothetically  
I mean don't take this seriously  
Don't take me I mean just  
Uhh not credibly  
I'm feeling incredibly  
I mean let's see  
Just maybe  
I mean you are in me (You make me smile with my heart)  
Maybe, baby, baby  
You know I was just kidding  
Unless you gon' do it  
  
(You make me smile)

Something wrong

M.J. gone, our nigga dead!  
I slapped my girl, she called the feds  
I did that time and spent that bread  
I'm heading home, I'm almost there  
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs  
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me  
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university (All of the lights)

Her mother, brother, Grandmother hate me in that order  
Public visitation

It's amazing  
I'm the reason  
Everybody fired up this evening  
  
I'm exhausted  
Barely breathing  
Holding on to what I believe in  
  
No matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)  
  
I'm a monster

That'll never  
Ever be solved  
  
And no matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a monster  
I'm a maven  
I know this world is changin'  
  
Never gave in  
Never gave up  
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of  
  
No matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

If i ain't on my grind  
Then what you call that?  
  
Victorious  
Yeah we warriors

Strive for victory  
Standing at my podium  
I'm trying watch my sodium  
Die high blood pressure  
You even let the feds get cha!  
I'm amazin'  
Born on the full moon  
I was bred to get in  
No spoon  
That's why I'm so goose  
Summer time, no juice  
Big family, small house no rooms  
They like oh god!  
why you go so hard?  
Look what he's been through  
He deserves an applause  
  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' [Repeat: x3]

[Verse 1]  
There must be more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys  
And mess with other girls part time to improvise  
I knew she wouldn't vibe  
No I seen her inner eyes  
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs  
She telling me about how black people should enterprise  
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise  
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5  
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive  
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie  
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.  
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high  
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe  
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe  
Boo back in 92' I was just like you  
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels  
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool  
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school  
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
We ball til we fall  
Hit the mall  
After we  
Hit don't call  
We fill your lives  
With nothing but lies  
And I would like to  
Apologize  
  
But you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is going to be alright  
Cause until the day a real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was it something I did wrong?  
Yeah I know I'm wrong  
She's at home alone and I'm always gone  
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive  
Now she on the internet looking for classes  
Out of state though, man that hurt yo  
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo  
And she don't call a lot  
And when she do she pouring out her heart  
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm  
And I promised her everything  
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring  
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring  
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges  
Never had money so I feel like a virgin  
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry  
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with
Halle Berry?  
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week  
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings  
Her mother picked up the phone  
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more  
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys  
And focus on school full-time to improvise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No no, you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
Cause until that real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise (x3)  


[Verse:]  
You don't need me to ever write  
I read your last message at least 1000 times  
At least 1000, at least 1000 times  
Alright, alright, alright  
Why did you ever listen to  
People trying to hate on you  
At least you know that's nothing new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby, you're awesome  
So awesome  
You look too good to be at work  
You feel too good to ever hurt  
I hope you ready for tonight  
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert  
You can't be still  
You gotta move, you gotta dance  
I gotta live, I gotta love  
I got a hope, I got a chance  
Cause baby, you're awesome  
You don't need to listen to your manager  
You're way too hot for them to handle you  
Baby, not doing nothing? You  
Came for something that I've got it  
Why you fallin' on me  
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Don't let nobody bring you down  
You're so awesome  
You're so out the park  
You're so after dark  
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right  
Oh, you nnannanaa  
I know you must be tired  
From running through my mind  
Can I come inside?  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Also, I'm also awesome, also  
I'm also awesome  
Y'all know  
And I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Don't let nobody bring you down  
You're so awesome  
You're so out the park, you're so after time  
You're so breaking?, oh it feels so right


Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now  
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown, bound  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?  
She say she only here for her girl birthday  
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty  
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty  
I know I got a bad reputation  
Walking 'round, always mad reputation  
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation  
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation  
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement  
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining  
How you gon' be mad on vacation?  
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans  
Uh, this that prom shit  
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit  
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit  
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch  
  
I know you're tired of loving, of loving  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures  
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches, bound  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink  
After that, give you something to drink  
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink  
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?  
Hey, you remember where we first met?  
Okay, I don't remember where we first met  
But hey, admitting is the first step  
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect  
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep  
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect  
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving  
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas  
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist  
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?  
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps  
But first, you gon' remember how to forget  
After all these long-ass verses  
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept  
  
I know you're tired of loving, of loving  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody  
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth  
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up  
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters  
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "heat" It Up  
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front  
I make history E'ry day - I don't need a month  
The survey says - by the streets according  
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan  
Was to the Nba when he was scorin'  
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and...

Yeah, you know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  
  
Why you actin' all  
Shy and all  
Why is y'all  
Lyin' for?  
"I never did this before"  
Stop that  
What, you want some patron?  
I got that  
I mean I promise y'all  
You fine and all  
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw  
But she not like you  
No, she not like you  
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue  
All that talking is goin' give me a Tylenol  
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all  
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off  
But, I just thought you should know  
We hit the liquor store  
Got some Cris and some Mo  
And we about to let it flow  
Had some problems before but see we let em go  
Got an ounce of that dro  
And we about to let it blow  
  
Yeah, you know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that, I grab yo ass  
  
See you know my style  
I'm very wild  
And I vow that my child will be well endowed  
Like his daddy  
And tell him that your mama had a fattie  
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"  
Yep, we was practicing  
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging  
You know what though? You my favorite accident  
So go head pop some Cristal  
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all  
  
Know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  
But, I just thought you should know  
We hit the liquor store  
Got some cris and some mo  
And we about to let it flow  
Had some problems before but see we let em go  
Got an ounce of that dro  
And we about to let it blow  
  
Ho! Ho! (We lookin' for some) Ho! Ho!


(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?  
You don't see just how fly my style is?  
I don't see why I need a stylist  
When I shop so much I can speak Italian  
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids  
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects  
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit  
My Dad'll say "when you see clothes close ya eyelids"  
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son  
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones  
'Cause every summer he'll get some  
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from  
And I don't know what he did for dough  
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'  
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'  
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion  
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'  
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?  
I guess me if it isn't you  
Last week I paid a visit to the institute  
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school  
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do  
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle  
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems  
Like I dropped out of P.E.  
They used to feel invisible  
Now they know they invincible  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
This is the story of a champion  
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns  
Stand up stand up! Here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
This is the story of a champion  
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns  
Stand up stand up! Here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)


Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought  
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out  
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about  
And they still want to know when the album comin? out  
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids  
What they definition of Classic is  
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth  
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth  
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters  
Everybody co-signing even non-believers  
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders  
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers  
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas  
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches  
Nas, made you look, before the haters  
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus  
This is classic  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Kanye West:]  
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness  
It?s performin?, look how long the line is  
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless  
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers  
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?  
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish  
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base  
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened
to my pace  
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I
expected it  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Nas:]  
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this  
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing
twice  
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur
night is show time  
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one
less man  
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans
and vans  
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you
could afford it the car ain?t important  
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment  
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager
to jump on  
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty
for doing wrong  
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[KRS One:]  
How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded  
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect  
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop  
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?  
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear
more local MC?s  
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and
rap  
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they
people  
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One  


Kanye West! (Swag King Cole) DJ Khaled!  
  
Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)  
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)  
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws  
Come to meet me without no drawers?  
  
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik  
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music  
In the projects one day, to Project Runway  
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it  
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up  
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it  
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid  
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!  
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute  
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!  
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you  
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you  
  
Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)  
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)  
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws  
Come to meet me without no drawers?  
  
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick  
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz  
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim  
Around the same time she had fell in love with him  
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang  
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team  
La Familia, Roc Nation  
We in the building, we still keep it basement  
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute  
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news  
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you  
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you  
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh  
Anything else, we detest, detest  
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts  
All that said, let me ask this quest'  
  
Can't a young nigga get money any more?  
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor  
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws  
Come to meet me without, don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga,  
I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you  
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you  
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you  
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some theraflu  
  
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the theraflu  
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the theraflu  
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh uh) Get the theraflu


On lonely nights I start to fade  
(On lonely nights I start to fade)  
Her love is a thousand miles away  
(Her love is a thousand miles away)  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
  
It's 4am and I can't sleep  
(It's 4am and I can't sleep)  
Her love is all that I can see  
(Her love is all that I can see)  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Winter, winter  
  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
If spring can take the snow away  
(If spring can take the snow away)  
Can it melt away all of our mistakes  
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes)  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again  
  
Never again


[Chorus]  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(That's that crack music nigga)  
(That real black music nigga)  
  
How we stop the black panthers?  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that?  
What Gil Scott was hearing  
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland  
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch  
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it  
The fiends cop it  
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit  
We ain't sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the place where the fathers gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the  
Gonna lock us up in a, home  
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes  
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax?  
George Bush got the answers  
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical  
Am and Hammer baking soda  
Raised they own quota  
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause  
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman  
Ta being a president look there's hope man  
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man  
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music you make when you round that  
Crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?  
  
That's that crack music, crack music  
That real black music, black music  
  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music  
  
Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our
daily bread  
See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy  
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's  
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use
it


[Mos Def]  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Lupe Fiasco]  
Head to the sky, wings raised in  
She's about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground  
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around  
But aint no going back, this is how it must be  
He told her, she'll be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly  
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that, because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her  
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter, it opens up another part  
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)  
  
[Mos Def]  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Kanye West]  
Don't let me hold you back  
I only hold you back  
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac  
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye  
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet  
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle  
You woulda been the best mom  
I would have been the best 'Ye  
You see it all in my veins, like varicose  
I know that's very gross but we getting very close  
To our end, though I killed most with a pen  
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin  
  
[Mos Def]  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial

[Big Sean]  
Okay now baby here we go, we go  
No baby, me go  
You got my heart  
Baby this what it be for  
I give it all as far as my feet go  
What do you mean, me go  
Why can't it be, we go  
What happens when people turn to tears  
Dreams turn to memories  
And weeks turn to years  
Huh? Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks  
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts  
Man, our vacation was coming next week  
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)  
How cud my girl do this to me  
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me  
Now I'm testing one two  
Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One, two, three, four, five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday  
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask "Y" sometimes like a f-cking vowel  
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl  
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds  
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.  
So I could see you smile  
  
I-I know you can see me now  
  
[Mos Def]  
  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view

Uh, I'll show you how to do this son  
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry paddings  
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (you-uh)

Then, hop ya ass out that S-class  
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask

[Jay-Z]  
We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo  
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos  
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough  
When they see him, whips be European  
If you're a ten, chances you're with him  
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them  
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him  
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction  
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'  
You can't rain dance on his picnic  
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness  
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you cb-4  
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the are. O. C. Bitch  
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!  
  
[Hook:]  
Still smokin that la-la-la

[Verse Three: Kanye West]  
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin  
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics  
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out  
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother  
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?  
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group  
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo  
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals  
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials  
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential  
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential  
That have fun breakin her fundamentals  
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium  
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium  
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney  
And Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam  
  
[Hook:]  
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la  
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la  
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five  
It's the are. O. C. Bitch, sing our lullaby  
C'mon!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit  
You should come, hang with me, basically  
Whoa, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami


And I can see it with my eyes closed, now  
Feeling like my life froze  
I'm about to hit the ground  
  
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal  
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal  
This game you could never win  
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again  
Get away from me misery  
Get away from me lonliness  
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness  
Get away from me wack tracks  
I can only make only hits  
I'm an only child lost in the World  
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring  
It's Feeling like hell rings  
Bringing me back down  
Checking my background  
It's ironic what's happening  
Imagine if I didn't have the ends  
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends  
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk  
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk  
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more  
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore  
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him  
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again  
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul  
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed  
  
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now  
Feeling like my life froze  
I'm about to hit the ground  
  
I sold my soul to the devil,  
I know it's a crappy deal,  
At least it came with a few toys,  
Like a Happy Meal,  
I'm spaced out dog,  
I be on that moontalk,  
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?  
You know the entertainment Angels  
Adriana for Giselle,  
Lets exchange Angels  
Photoshoot at my crib,  
Lets exchange angles  
Rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles,  
I'm so anxious I'm gettin anxiety  
Begging one of these f-ckin fashion houses to hire me,  
They say I've been an asshole,  
I said if you acquire me,  
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting  
Give me your herbal chai tea  
I'll be calm as Tai Chi  
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T  
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off,  
I'm Paranoid Like bonin' Raw dog  
And wakin up with a slight cough  
Yea, that'll make ya dick quite soft  
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off  
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off  
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off


[Intro: Father's Children]  
Dirt and grime and filth inside

Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo  
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel  
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?  
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)  
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home  
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone

The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's  
I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called "I miss the old Kanye"  
Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye  
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye


Flashing lights, lights

Throw your hands in the air if you real as me  
Oooooooooooh  
  
(Kid Cudi)  
Are you?  
Ready to go?  
I know the city gettin' ready for me  
I know the city gettin' ready  
  
(Kanye)  
Such an easy mornin', we on a ride  
And I'm feelin' smooth as the way the Benz drive  
Turn the radio down if they playin' that bullshit  
They don't want black people to think at trial  
He think he live  
  
(Common)  
He think he live, he think he cold  
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode  
Eyes low'd, I let the skies hold the thoughts  
The streets are like the high road that I go across  
  
(Kanye)  
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets  
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week  
And the weather wasn't barely hot  
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?  
Did I mention G. O. O. D. Music, yeah, forever we hot  
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?  
  
Are you?  
Ready to go?

(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop!)  
(This goes out to the allcore hip-hop)  
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop!)  
  
(Pusha T)  
As 'Ye flips the piano  
The mood swings like the change of a channel  
He's heating up like they wrapped him in flannel  
Sellin' kilos through your ipod nano  
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal  
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle  
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires  
Ice cream paint job, somethin' like Breyers  
Euro tank top, Dior inspired  
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required  
(Eyuck!) I'm 2012 in 2010  
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz  
Floss for the members of the gang with 28  
While haters wish death 'pon me, that's many men  
Yeah, and if you slaim you on your paper route  
Stop talkin', motherfucker, pull your paper out

And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside!)  
Westside, Westside!  
So te-te-tell who the freshest of 'em all?  
They claimin' that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my balls  
A nigga seen the fresh like I'm headed to the fall  
Mc hunting season, putting heads up on the wall  
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft  
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers  
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs  
All over double Ds, I be absent all week  
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for  
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door  
Hold on: That's the girl you gave a wedding ring?  
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything  
  
(Charlie Wilson)

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane  
While getting' some brain  
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"  
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz  
Having' money's the everything that having' it is  
I was splurging' on trizz  
But when I get my card back activated  
I'm back to Vegas cause  
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it  
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life  
  
Is the good life better than the life I live  
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy  
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby  
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky  
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh  
I'm good


Uh, Good morning  
  
Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh  
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed  
I mean, damn, did you even see the test  
You got D's motherfucker, D's, Rosie Perez  
And yes, barely pass any and every class  
Lookin' at every ass  
Cheated on every test  
I guess this is my dissertation  
Homie, this shit is basic  
Welcome to graduation  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
  
On this day we become legendary  
Everything we dreamed of  
I'm like a fly Malcolm X  
Buy any jeans necessary  
Detroit wear cleaned up  
From the streets of the league  
From an eighth to a key  
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets  
From the moments of pain  
Look how far we done came  
Haters sayin' ya changed  
Now ya doin' ya thang  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future  
While I hop in the Delorean  
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student  
Some people graduate, but we still stupid  
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around  
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus  
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness  
After all of that, you receive this  
  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
  
Get on down  
Get, get on down  
Get on down  
Get, get on down


I'm not sure anymore-more  
Who is knocking at my door-door  
All the faces that I know  
Ja make them so sunny and true  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night  
  
Right now I can see it so vivid  
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it  
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip  
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits  
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that  
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph  
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh  
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass  
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'  
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'  
What do it mean when you never dream at all then  
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them  
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to  
People you never got a chance to say bye to  
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams  
Into real life, if you try to  
So close, but so far  
And so far, no cigar  
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today  
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow  
No goodbye  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night  
  
Uh, to you  
If I part my heart will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
My art will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I'm not sure anymore-more  
Who is knocking at my door-door  
All the faces that I know  
Ja make them so sunny and true


What in the fuck was that Kanye  
I told you to do some shit for the kids  
You can give me your motherfucking graduation ticket right now  
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage  
A motherfucker can't pull you across that stage Kanye  
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting  
I'm trying to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone
do me  
You know what us a nigga  
And I don't mean that in no nice way  
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you  
You throw your mother hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody  
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus  
Mother what you gone do now  
  
I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody  
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody  
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody  
My momma would kill me but don't anybody  
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody  
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody


Oh, it can't be G.O.O.D music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
But you niggaz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami  
  
GLC gon' be stoned as Angie  
I be Don C, Johnny Patrone and me  
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign  
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T  
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man  
  
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest  
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas  
From the Chi, the city of hella haters  
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators  
  
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus  
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us  
Turn the radio down I mean every song  
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian  
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on  
  
Until Khaled turned up the volume  
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'  
Nas done told you come on homie we major  
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'  
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'  
  
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family  
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep  
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep  
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side  
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family  
  
It's the Cons fool, word  
  
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie  
  
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me  
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley  
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys  
No different than Grand Prix's  
  
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze  
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed  
I started independent with owners from land speed  
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed  
  
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be  
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B  
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy  
  
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties  
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby  
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby  
  
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath  
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed  
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step  
  
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check  
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is  
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is  
  
The Grammy Family  
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night  
Celebrate tonight, oh, it's alright, it's alright, yeah


It was all good just a week ago  
Niggas feel they selves  
And then Watch The Throne drop  
Niggas kill they selves  
What niggas gon' do Hov?  
This a new crack on a new stove  
I'm in the two-door, true that  
Niggas tellin' me "You back" (you back)  
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?  
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?  
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh  
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga  
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it  
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it  
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me  
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically  
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga  
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga  
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids  
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit  
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit  
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit  
Got 'em jumpin' out the building  
Watch out below, a million out the door  
  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
  
Fuck y'all mad at me for?  
Y'all don't even know what I've been through  
I play chicken with a Mack truck  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved  
I swam waters with great whites  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed  
I hustle with vultures late nights  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food  
Fuck wrong with these dudes  
Try to walk around in these shoes  
See the shit I saw growing up  
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's  
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like  
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really  
I'm like really half a billi nigga  
Really you got baby money  
Keep it real with niggas  
Niggas ain't got my lady money  
Watch the Throne don't step on our road  
Bad enough we let you step on our globe  
When my nephew died, daddy dead  
Niggas took the price on my uncles head  
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled  
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread  
Bow down, brother pay homage  
Don't spill hate all on my garments  
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh  
Head shots nigga fuck your vests  
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork  
Peace God 'cause you know a nigga just went Ham  
  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM


[Chorus]  
In the night, I hear 'em talk,  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..  
How could you be so heartless?  
Oh, how could you be so heartless?  
  
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo  
Just remember that you talkin' to me though  
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo  
I mean after all the things that we've been through  
I mean after all the things we got into  
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me  
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me  
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me  
So you walk around like you don't know me  
You got a new friend, well I got homies  
But in the end it's still so lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know  
I decided we weren't goin' speak so  
Why we up three A.M. on the phone  
Why does she be so mad at me for  
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold  
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up  
Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me  
They say that they don't see what you see in me  
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
You'll never find nobody better than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk  
Baby let's just knock it off  
They don't know what we been through  
They don't know 'bout me and you  
So I got something new to see  
And you just goin' keep hatin' me  
And we just goin' be enemies  
I know you can't believe  
I could just leave it wrong  
And you can't make it right  
I'm goin' take off tonight  
Into the night  
  
[Chorus]


I think I just fell in love with a porn star  
Turn the camera on, she a born star  
Turn the corners in a foreign car  
Call the coroners do the C.P.R.  
She gave that old nigger an ulcer  
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh)  
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh)  
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh)  
Move down town cop a sweet space (uh)  
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what)  
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh)  
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grab my hand and  
Baby we'll live a hell of a life  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
In your wildest  
You can hear the loudest screams  
Comin' from inside the screen  
You a wild bitch  
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy  
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy  
Or do anal, or do a gang bang  
It's kinda crazy, it's opposite the same thing  
Well I guess a lot of niggers do gang bang  
And if you run trains, we all in the same game  
Run away slaves all on a chain gang  
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star  
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard  
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids  
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the brides maid s  
She wanna roll play, 'till I roll over  
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja  
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day  
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar Day  
Laurenta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the change  
That's a dress of her back and told her get away  
How can they say they live they life wrong  
When you never fuck wit' the lights on  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grand my hand  
Baby we'll live a hell of a life  
  
I think I fell in love with a porn star  
And got married in the bathroom  
Honeymoon on the dance floor  
And got divorced by the end of the night  
That's one hell of a life


(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine  
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine  
I'm finna take yall back to them better times  
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind  
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi  
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold  
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul  
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?  
You work late nights just to keep on the lights  
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike  
And you would give anything in this world  
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl  
And you never put no man over me  
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?  
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes  
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry  
As we knelt on the kitchen floor  
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more  
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more  
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford  
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable  
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot  
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do  
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)  
  
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates  
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate  
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with  
But still supported me when I did the opposite  
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get  
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you  
You was getting through, can the choir please  
Give me a verse of "You, Are So Beautiful To Me"  
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry  
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy  
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet  
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)  
  
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
I guess it also depends though, if my ends low  
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo  
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)  
  
Tell your job you gotta fake em out  
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out  
To a restaurant, upper echelon  
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want  
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?  
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right  
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday  
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)  
  
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

Hell, they sell the herb  
  
Now open up your mind to this concept  
Then you take one step  
Straight from the feelin of a wordsmith  
That's the herb shit  
Up on my 22 spins  
In my baby blue benz  
Girls say dat boys ben actin up  
But that's the way he is  
  
You lookin good when you steppin out a centerfold  
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold  
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game  
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it  
So now let me sugarcoat it  
It's like I'm on that tight herb  
And when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like  
  
Your my latest, and my geatest  
My latest, my greatest  
(Chorus)(x2)  
  
When I'm layin in the back of my 745  
With my lips on you  
Spittin good game  
With the hustler grain  
Gettin brained like a hustler should  
Hustler would  
And you know when I hear the stuff  
I'm still tryin to hear this love what that do  
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you jus got me sprung  
What that do  
  
Oh yes she's one of the best  
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin  
Lurkin searchin for the virgin  
But when my babygurl it's workin  
Let me know whats that you smokin  
From the hands as I stick my tounge in  
Then from the back but she want an autograph  
But still we sexin'  
  
Open back up last time  
As I spit a little dough in my mind  
She jus like one of a kind  
No c's no stand in her hind  
Shes jus like me rappin a line  
Perfect let me drop in a dime  
I'm on a roll again  
I'm bought to blow again  
  
Your my latest, and my geatest  
My latest, my greatest  
[Chorus:]

Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast y'all  
Mr. West what do you think is the best?  
(take em backstage get acquainted that's what I suggest dawg)  
When it comes to spittin G I'm one of the best y'all  
She looks good smell clean and she had fresh draws  
Naw that's too good to be  
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me no!  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x  
I gota way with words I use words in ways

Polly want a Gucci Parka ma what did you say?  
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today hey  
But anyway though she got it on smash like mashed potatoes  
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo  
Lay low got play dough stash the payroll  
Ain't no credit card spendin cash on Rodeo  
And me I'm at the Slausson swap meet  
Lookin for a pair of air one's and white tee  
She want champagne I got sisco and cool-aid  
Why go to the movies let's watch the bootleg  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x

Or wore versake (versace) y'all is too boughi  
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton  
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on  
That's what my old chick used to clash with me  
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)  
Actually you should be happy I purchased that  
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat  
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours  
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter  
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame  
I got a new significant other cause plans change  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye  
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye  
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye  
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes  
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye  
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye  
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye


[Chorus]  
Find your dreams come true  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
I've been waiting on this my whole life  
These dreams be waking me up at night  
You say I think I'm never wrong  
You know what, maybe you're right, aight  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
You say he get on your fucking nerves  
You hope that he get what he deserves, word  
Do you even remember what the issue is  
You just trying to find where the tissue is  
You can still be who you wish you is  
It ain't happen yet  
And that's what the intuition is  
When you hop back in the car  
Drive back to the crib  
Run back to their arms  
The smokescreens  
The chokes and the screams  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
And I'm back on my grind  
A psychic read my lifeline  
Told me in my lifetime  
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline  
And that's what I'm  
Seven o'clock, that's primetime  
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines  
Why he keep giving me hot lines  
I'm a star, how could I not shine  
How many ladies in the house  
How many ladies in the house without a spouse  
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused  
What you about  
On that independent shit  
Trade it all for a husband and some kids  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams


Some glad morning when this life is over  
I'll fly away  
To a home on God's celestial shore  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away  
  
When the shadows of this life have flown  
I'll fly away  
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away  
  
Just a few more weary days and then  
I'll fly away  
To a land where joy shall never end  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away


I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that  
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that  
I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that  
I think I was made for that  
So I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right  
  
Stop all your blood clot cryin, I was flyin'  
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in  
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear ya mom  
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31  
They said the best classes go to the fastest  
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get  
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?  
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?  
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin  
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin  
Man, this is an insult  
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow  
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo  
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro  
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?  
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all depends, oh, oh  
Stop your cryin baby  
  
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that  
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that  
I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that  
I think I was made for that  
So I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right  
  
You know when you be late you miss all the lights  
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)  
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight  
That night (that night) that night  
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow  
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close  
With the freshest hoes, the professors know  
We about to get real unprofessional  
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?  
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like  
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that  
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that  
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later  
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it  
I'm so live with it, look how I did it  
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it  
I know it's late and I took all year but  
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah


[Chorus:]  
Just gots me a crib and a new car too  
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe  
C'mon let's get married babe  
C'mon let's get married  
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house  
A lil white fence, just like this, babe  
C'mon let's get married babe  
Let's get married  
  
[Jagged Edge]  
Meet me at the alter  
In your white dress (your white dress)  
You won't ever need another man  
You never, ever want from another thing, no  
I've been feeling you  
I must confess (must confess)  
Ain't no gonna break this thang up  
I ain't going nowhere, no  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jagged Edge]  
Said you want some karats  
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)  
Is it good enough for you to brag on  
When you show your friends (show your friends)  
I just want to be with you  
Girl there ain't I think I won't do  
Want you to be the one to say I do  
We can start a family  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Kanye West]  
With my tuxedo  
He asked me do you take this  
Woman to hold and keep the safest  
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper  
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics  
Diamonds your bestfriend  
That makes sense because  
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts  
But as long as you gots your defenses up  
You can never get the love that was meant for ya  
Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna  
Club  
Real thugs don't never fall in love  
Always on the g-o, for the d-o  
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie  
Since my money get right theses days  
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades  
I gots the church, the ring  
There's something I'm forgetting  
Oh, we gotta have J. E. Sing at the wedding  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate  
They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate  
Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate  
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga 'scape  
House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake  
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break  
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand  
'Til he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan  
Created a buzz 'til where you gotta mention his name  
When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game  
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them  
G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them...


[Man]  
Hey Jimmy where you going?  
  
[Jimmy]  
I don't know where I'm going.  
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.  
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?",  
But he just kept learning.  
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,  
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.  
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.  
And now I'm just glad he left me these.  
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have.  
These are documented.  
My father left them for me.  
And I'm going to leave them to my kids.  
I'm going to learn too.  
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.  
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.  
Who has that


I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my mind  
I'm building a still  
To slow down time  
  
I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my mind  
I'm building a still  
To slow down the time  
  
I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my line  
I'm building a still  
Down the time ooh  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night  
Said shes down for the night  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
Your my devil, your my angel  
Your my heaven, your my hell  
You're my now, you're my forever  
You're my freedom, your my jail  
You're my lies, your my truth  
You're my war, you're my truce  
Your my questions, your my proof  
Your my stress your masseuse  
Mama say mama say mama gos-an  
Lost in this plastic light  
Let's break out of this fake ass party  
Turn this into a classic night  
If we die in each others arms  
Still get laid in that afterlife  
If we die in each others arms  
Still get laid yea  
  
I'm up in the woods  
(Run from the lights, run from the night  
Run for your life  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night)  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
Hey oh wow oh

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
What I had to do, had to run from you  
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong  
And that haunted me, all the way home  
So ya never know, never never know  
Never know enough, til it's over love  
Til we lose control, system overload  
Screaming no no no, no no  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you  
So I keep it low, keep a secret code  
So everybody else don't have to know  
  
[Chorus]  
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose  
  
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to  
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true  
I got something to lose, so I gotta move  
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too  
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own  
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone  
How many times did it take til I finally got through  
You lose, you lose  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
See I had to go, I had to move  
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life  
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
I met no one new, I got no one new  
No I said I'm through, but got love for you  
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going  
Keep it on a roll, only god knows  
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused  
You choose, you choose  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
Way I wanna go, I don't need you  
I been down this road, too many times before  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
  
[Chorus]


[Chorus:]  
I never liked you n-ggas  
Who knew one day I'd be just like you n-ggas  
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas  
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas  
When I become my mama's boyfriends?  
When I become my mama's boyfriends?  
  
He walked in our lives  
I was only five  
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly  
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize  
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy  
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband  
I was the man of the house when there wasn't  
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm  
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum  
We are the voices of our parents bad choices  
The aftermath of divorces  
The kids of bitter split ups  
And baby sitters  
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us  
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new n-gga  
You old Old Spice wearing  
Short chain wearing  
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing  
Church sock wearing  
When you first stop caring about your appearance  
When you get here anyway I already got parents  
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons  
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance  
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance  
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring  
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud  
But the door was locked and the tv up so loud  
I scream out "I ain't going to sleep no time soon,  
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room"  
  
I don't like you n-gga  
If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga  
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga  
Don't go to sleep at night you n-gga  
  
And it seems like I wasted time  
If that's what it's all about  
Mama if that's moving up than I  
  
When I become my mama's boyfriends  
Twenty years later where has the time gone  
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own  
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around  
I never thought I'd ever raise another n-ggas child  
He don't like his mama's boyfriend  
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing  
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then  
Cause when she here he be quiet  
When she leave he be talking again  
He be wylin again  
Be calm I don't drink the drama  
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on  
You gon marry my mom look  
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms  
And I did take little man to church  
And took little man to school  
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules  
Even though I aint raised you  
You your mama angel  
Don't get it twisted baby boy I'll Ving Rhames you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
When I become my mama's boyfriends?


Yeah  
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is  
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas  
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses  
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses  
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles  
Rubber band together in cashless bundles  
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains  
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change  
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'  
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson  
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell  
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?  
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail  
Children are unheld  
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale, Horse"  
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it  
  
"Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again  
I'm on my way home  
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone  
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it  
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"


Yeah, grandmama  
Told you I won't let you down  
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me  
One thing I found, one thing I found  
I know you'll neva let me down  
Get up I get

First had they ear now I have they're heart  
Rappers came and went, I've been hear from the start  
Seen them put it together, watch them take it apart  
  
See the rollers roll up wit ribbons  
I see the we poe, we sold then we driven  
So when I reload, he holds number one position  
When you hot I'm hot and when my feet cold mines is sizzelin'  
  
It's plain to see, nigga's can't fuck wit me  
'Cuz I'ma be that nigga for life, this is not an image  
This is got given, this is hard liven  
Mixed wit crystall sippin', it's the most consistent

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma  
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat  
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in  
With that in my blood I was born to be different  
  
Now niggas can't make it to battles to chose leadership  
But we can make it to jacobs to [unverified] the dealership  
That's why I hear new music and I just dun b feelin' it  
Racism still alive they just be concealin' it  
  
But I know they don't want me in the damn club  
They even made me show I. D. To get up in to sam's club  
I did dirk and went to church and get my hands scrubbed  
That why I've baptized at least 3 or 4 times  
  
But in the land where nigga's pray, you con's are getting paid  
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get [unverified]  
Notin' sadder than that day my girl father past away  
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter  
  
And you know I'd like to thank you for they way that she was brought up  
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her  
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my left eye  
'Cuz look what a accident did to left eye  
  
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die  
I know a got angels watchin' me from the other side  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me  
One thing I found, one thing I found

[Intro]  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say  
  
[Hook 1]  
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun  
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say  
  
[Hook 2]  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand  
  
[Bridge]  
So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly  
  
[Hook 3]  
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun  
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name  
And you're still my chosen one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Outro]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Wise men say  
Wise men say  
Wise men say  
Never figure out real love  
You'll never figure out real love  
You'll never figure out real love  
  
It's so crazy  
I got everything figured out  
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about  
No doubt  
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love is
about  
  
Do you think I sacrificed real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights?  
Do you think I sacrifice a real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights?  
  
There is no Gucci I can buy  
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on  
There is no YSL that they could sell  
To get my heart out of this hell  
And my mind out of this jail  
There is no clothes that I could buy  
That could turn back the time  
There is no vacation spot I could fly  
That could bring back a piece of real life  
Real life, what does it feel like?  
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight  
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight  
To live a real life  
I just want to be a real boy  
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy  
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy  
  
It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it  
I tell the truth and I keep runnin  
It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something  
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing  
  
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?  
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel  
Do you really have the stamina...  
For everybody that sees you to say 'where's my camera?'  
For everybody that sees you to say 'sign my autograph'  
For everybody that sees you cry and say 'you oughtta laugh'  
You oughtta laugh  
I just want to be a real boy,  
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story goes...  
  
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me  
The only one was behind me I can't find her no more,  
I can't find her no more I cant...  
The only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...  
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream  
  
And the fame will be got caught  
And the day I moved to LA  
Maybe that was all my fault  
All my fault to be a real boy  
Chasing the American dream,  
Chasing everything we seen  
Up on the TV screen  
And when I- the Benz was left  
And the clothes was left  
And the hoes was left  
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-  
You spent the doughs to death  
And tell me what tf for a real boy  
  
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy  
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way  
The wise man say, you'll find your way  
The wise man say, you'll find your way  
The wise man say


I'm living' in that 21st century  
Doing something mean to it  
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it  
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it  
I guess every superhero need his theme music  
  
No one man should have all that power  
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours  
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power  
(21st century schizoid man)  
  
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open  
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling  
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'  
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands  
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen  
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'  
Huh? I see you in the mornin'  
This is way too much, I need a moment  
  
No one man should have all that power  
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours  
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power  
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours  
  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)  
  
Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast  
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass  
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole  
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes  
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon  
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in  
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic  
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted  
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts  
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault  
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty  
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts  
Reality is catchin' up with me  
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody  
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me  
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece  
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power  
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours  
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder  
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours  
  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)  
  
Holy, powers, Austin, Powers  
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation  
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"  
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation  
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit  
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit  
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick  
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?  
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'  
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'  
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'  
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)  
  
Now this would be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window  
Letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
  
Now this would be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window  
Letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
  
Now this would be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window  
Letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
  
You got the power to let power go?

To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's  
  
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome

You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit

Fast forward to the end of my song  
And say third verse me, verse me  
Whenever I hit the block I see  
  
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me  
From manicure sets to silky weaves  
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus  
Turkey, germy, dirty  
  
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick, no  
Let the pioneer blast my shit  
Wait a minute, hold up, nigga  
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh  
  
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa

Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes  
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold

Straight up outta movie scene  
Who knew she was a drama queen  
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's  
Up late night, like she on patrol  
Checkin' everything like I'm on parole  
I told her it's some things she don't need to know  
She never let it go, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now  
You never stop it now  
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now  
We need to drop it now, drop it, drop it  
  
Cause I don't want no robocop  
You movin' like a robocop  
When did you become a robocop  
No, I don't need a robocop  
  
Just looking at your history  
You're like the girl from misery  
She said she ain't take it to this degree  
Well let's agree to disagree  
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on  
Keep it up enough to keep it going on  
I told her it's some things she don't need to know  
She never let it go, oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause I don't want no robocop  
You movin' like a robocop  
When you become a robocop  
Somebody please make it stop  
  
Stop, drop, roll, pop  
Bitch, I'm cold,  
Ain't use to being, told stop  
So I can never be your Robot  
Fast or slow  
You can stay, you can go  
Now that you know, now that you know

You get mad when you know

[Chorus]  
  
Okay  
Okay  
Okay (hey hey)


And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,  
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,  
Every one of them that I know  
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs  
That'll never take work off  
Baby, I got a plan  
Run away fast as you can  
  
She find pictures in my email  
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick  
I don't know what it is with females  
But I'm not too good at that shit  
See, I could have me a good girl  
And still be addicted to them hood rats  
And I just blame everything on you  
At least you know that's what I'm good at  
  
And I always find  
Yeah I always find  
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long

Twenty four seven, three sixty five,  
Pussy stays on my mind  
I-I-I-I did it,  
All right, all right, I admit it  
Now pick your best move,  
You could leave or live wit' it  
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off  
Split and go where?  
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha  
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off  
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off  
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers  
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas  
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet  
Comes with a price tag, baby face it  
You should leave if you can't accept the basics  
Plenty bitches in the baller-nigga matrix  
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless  
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless  
P!  
  
Never was much of a romantic  
I could never take the intimacy  
And I know it did damage  
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me  
I guessin' you're at an advantage  
'Cause you could blame me for everything  
And I don't know where I'ma manage  
If one day you just up and leave  
  
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,  
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,  
Every one of them that I know  
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs  
That'll never take work off  
Baby, I got a plan  
Run away fast as you can


Why would she make calls out the blue  
Now I'm awake sleep isn't new  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will  
Unless you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will  
Then play you will

Mrs. So Fly crash lands in my room  
Can't waste no time she might leave soon  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will  
You will, you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I admit I still fantasize about you, about you  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Don't say you will

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Please say you will

[Verse 1]  
I'ma get on this TV, momma  
I'ma, I'ma break shit down  
I'ma make sure these light skinned niggaz  
Never ever never come back in style  
Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business  
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'  
No, I decided I was finished  
Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned  
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned  
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there  
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year  
This nigga graduated at the top of my class  
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
I got a Jones like Norah for your sorror'  
Bring more of them girls I've seen in the Aurora  
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or'a Shirley  
I'm tryin' to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry  
See, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow  
Rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style  
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style  
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style  
And I ain't even pledge  
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead  
If I could go through all that and still be breathing  
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel a woo coming on, cause  
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause  
  
There it was  
I feel some woos coming on, cause  
A couple woos coming on, 'cause  
  
There they was  
I feel a woo coming on, cause  
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause  
  
There it was  
A couple woos coming on, cause  
A couple woos coming on, 'cause  
  
There they was


Now beat that  
And your mothers saying "go to college"  
So you finish college and its wonderful  
You feel so good  
And after all the partying and crazing  
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around
your peers  
Hey now you'll get that 25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money  
No more borrowing money from mom for my high  
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it  
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!  
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretary's secretary!  
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary  
Who never went to college  
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family  
You know what college does for you?  
It makes you really smart man  
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok  
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be,  
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes  
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied  
When a lady walks to me says "hey you know what's sexy?"  
I say "no, I don't know what it is,  
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast".

If you pass on that Kane beat, that's your last thought  
Get what you ask for I swear that's your ass thought

So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow

My niggers is home, I guess I got everything  
Everything I want, but I don't

No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud  
Doing things not allowed

(Kanye - Verse 2)  
Poor the champagne let your watch show  
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal  
I admit my first watch was a fossil  
Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils  
Attention to detail is so uncanny  
And the whips on this? is so uncamrie  
Somebody needs to put us on camera  
The world of rollies and everyones family  
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes  
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys?  
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini  
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo  
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical  
This the cris year, last year was magic 32  
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye'  
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae  
I got style ask julie she heard in may  
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate  
FIrst of all we all know the beats is  
Like a mix between fergie and jeez  
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception  
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys  
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored  
All my hommies GD's but I am lord  
Rap god, Greek mythology  
And this life to crazy to think logicaly  
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy  
My life is like a childs solutions become reality  
  
(Beyonce)  
Now go get my throne cus I don't wanna stop

Till it's time to go when it's time to go  
Where you trying to go? you better act like you can see me know

But not quite cause you cut off my light  
But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell  
  
I got my life and its my only one  
I got the night, I'm running from the sun  
So goodnight, I made it out the door (door, door, door)  
After tonight, there will be no return  
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road  
I'm taking off on the road  
  
And that you know (that you know)  
Tell every one that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know (that you know)

You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine  
Okay I got you out my mind

Well know you know,

Tell everybody that you know

See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell

Reliving the past  
Yuh lost  
  
Rock star bitch call me Elvis  
M.O.B, she call me selfish  
Success got 'em jealous  
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling  
Tattoos, how they break the news  
It was real if you made the news  
Last night my bitches came in twos  
And they both suck like they came to lose  
Dropped out the first day of school  
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move  
I be going hard, I got a name to prove  
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve  
  
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down  
  
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down  
  
This the greatest shit in the club  
Since "In Da Club"  
It's so packed I might ride around  
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club  
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"  
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"  
If not, treat your friends like my Benz  
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end  
When I go raw, I like to leave it in  
When I wake up, I like to go again  
When I go to work, she gotta call it in  
She can't go to work, same clothes again  
And her heart colder than the souls of men  
Louboutin on the toes again  
Tight dress dancing close to him  
Yeezus just rose again  
  
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down  
  
Memories don't live like people do  
They always 'member you  
Whether things are good or bad  
It's just the memories that you have  
  
Memories don't live like people do  
They always 'member you  
Whether things are good or bad  
It's just the memories that you have


What a world that I'm livin' in  
Will the rainstorms ever end?  
Still I feel my path narrow I run again  
See happiness is gone again  
  
And then you see 'em gray clouds up above, man  
Metaphor to my life, man  
Still I feel my heart stronger then it's ever been  
Strong will to my journey ends  
  
'Til then I roll more then I've ever rolled  
Not pills but the marioll  
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days go  
Nothing helping with my head dose  
  
But I ain't sleepin', awake in another state  
Livin' in a new space  
Still I feel my mind runnin' at a steady pace  
God help me so I'll win the race  
  
'Til then I call  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
Come on, come on  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
  
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
Hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
  
Grey clouds took together fam  
Lining piercing to another land  
Over the desert wit' the lost play  
Soul searching each in every way  
  
An then you see the  
Awesome sounds so profound within it'll grip you  
You can see it if you hear, you can feel it too  
Somethin' special I am runnin' to  
  
'Til then I go away, very far away  
To another universe where all people say  
It's a new, new place for the special to embrace  
Like a Martian you seein' it wandered out the place  
  
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful  
Even if you dry you'll be floatin' high above it  
You can say bye, bye, bye  
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high  
  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
Come on, come on  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
  
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
Hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
  
I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up  
Yeah, gotta keep up, gotta keep up  
And I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up  
Yeah, gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah  
  
'Cause I'm gone, yeah, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
I'm up and away, na, na, na, na  
You know what I'm about? Hey, hey


And everybody say, say  
I know you, I know you  
  
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be  
I'm a raw flow 'cause it never get rusty  
I ain't gotta say it, man, dawg, trust me  
Bust somebody head, TLC, where was we?  
  
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter  
Niggas out in Georgetown, and Magic way harder  
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore 'em all up  
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, south  
  
Side of the broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars  
I'm like Jeff Fort, the way I get behind bars  
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars  
Come to the grip with conflict diamonds and the arts  
  
Back in '94 they call me Chi-Town's Nas  
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-Town's gods  
We even yo, you still talking no cops  
A conscious nigga with mac like Steven Jobs  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside side of the Chi  
  
Your fly is open, McFly  
The crowd is open, I think I know why  
I'm back from the future, seen it with my own eyes  
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi  
  
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon  
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons  
Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes  
People asking him, "Do you have any gray poupon?"  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside, side of the Chi  
  
You in the building but the building's falling  
You wouldn't be balling if your name is Spalding  
My mind get flooded, I think about New Orleans  
Back in school, y'all niggas, you should call him August  
  
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving  
Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling  
If rap was Harlem, I'd be James Baldwin  
With money in the bank like G Rap, we're calling  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi  
  
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera  
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas  
Can't wait 'til they say, "Yeah, he ran up at the Oscars"  
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie  
  
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta  
Mexicans don't love it like it was for La Raza  
But this is for the mobsters, holla  
We some true Chi-Town legends, accept no [Incomprehensible]  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi  
  
The un-American Idol, Tower like the Eiffel  
'Lean Wit it, Rock Wit It', black like the Disciples  
Know when to use a Bible and when to use a rifle  
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle  
  
Caught a case of robbery and 'Beat It' like Michael  
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku  
I write to 'Do the Right Things' like Spike do  
Through conflicts is crucial and trauma is psycho  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi  
  
We're coming from the  
[Incomprehensible] spice it up  
You might have to spice it up  
Spice it up, spice it up, take your life and  
  
Yo, we're coming from the  
We're coming from the


Let me know  
Do I still got time to grow  
Things ain't always set in stone  
That be known let me know  
Let me  
  
Seems like, street lights, glowin  
Happen to be just like moments, passin  
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and  
I paid my fare see I know my destination  
But I'm just not there  
  
All the street lights, glowin'  
Happen to be just like moments, passin'  
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and  
I paid my fare see I know my destination  
  
But I'm just not there  
In the streets  
In the, streets  
I'm just not there in the streets  
I'm just not there  
Life's just not fair

Damn, they don't make em like this anymore

Do anybody make real shit anymore?  
Bow in the presence of greatness  
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us  
You should be honored by my lateness  
That I would even show up to this fake shit  
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit  
Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit

I don't know if you got a man or not  
If you made plans or not  
God put me in the plans or not  
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot  
But I know that God put you in front of me  
So how the hell could you front on me?  
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me  
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?  
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night  
So we gonna do everything that Kan like  
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike  
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke  
And she'll do anything for the limelight  
And will do anything when the time's right  
Uh, baby you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Kanye West]  
Mr. West is in the buildin  
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion  
Ay yo, I know I got it first  
I'm Christopher Columbus and y'all just the pilgrims  
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?  
[?] I pass the dressing  
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent  
So I guess we should address it huh?  
My swagga is Mcjagga  
Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it  
Why he so mad for? Why he gotta have it?  
Cuz I slave my whole life, now I'm the master  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!  
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!  
Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon  
  
[Jay-Z]  
Gotta bop like this  
Can't wear skinny jeans  
Cuz my knots don't fit  
No one on the corner  
Gotta pocket like this  
So I rock Roc jeans  
Cuz my knots so thick  
You can learn how to dress  
Just by  
Jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Follow my steps  
It's the road to success  
Where the niggas think you thorough  
And the girls say yes  
But I can't teach you my swag  
You can pay for school  
But you can't buy class  
School of hard knocks  
I'm a grad  
All blue Yankee  
Is my graduation cap  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Dipping different rovas [?]  
Wipping with the soda [?]  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Could you even have any doubt  
After doutbt it was ova.  
  
[Lil' Wayne]  
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch!  
But I'm too clean for these boys  
I require what I desire  
I got stripes Adidas  
Mami scream papi no mas  
Run up in yo shit just me no moss  
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs  
No one has swagger like these 4 guys  
When it comes to styles I got several  
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal  
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow  
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo  
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto  
Write yo name on the bullet make you feel special  
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking about?  
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about!  
And I'm gone.. Bye  
  
[T. I.]  
You go see weezy for the wordplay,  
Jeezy for the bird play,  
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,  
All my verses picture perfect  
And they meant to serve a purpose,  
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless,  
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous,  
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,  
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is
what another rapper do,  
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have
outstanding qualities,  
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,  
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at,  
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,  
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,  
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad  
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag!


I walked in the crib  
Got two kids  
And my baby mamma late  
Uh oh uh oh uh oh  
And so I to did what I had to did  
Cuz I had the kid  
Duh oh duh oh duh oh  
Up all night, gettin' my money right  
Until the blue and white's  
Po po po po po po  
Now the money comin' slow  
But at least a nigga know slow motion better then  
No No No  
  
You love to hear the story again and again  
About these young brothers from the City of Wind  
Like juice and gin in the city we blend  
Amongst the hustle Titties and skin 50's and rims  
Y'all know the Sprewell's and trucks with detail  
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em  
Felt the southside venom with rawhides and denim  
Bent minds collide with 'em in a system that tries victims  
We livin' it my man in the fast lane pivotin'  
On the block yo they sellin' like Eminem  
On the block get jumped off like him and them  
On the block is hot you can feel it in your skinenen  
Shorties get the game with no instructions supersymbolin'  
Eyes right it seems like the fight is dimmin' 'em  
Come my man kuzzle like I'm kin' to him  
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him  
  
I walked in the crib  
Got two kids  
And my baby mamma late  
Uh oh uh oh uh oh  
And so I to did what I had to did  
Cuz I had the kid  
Duh oh duh oh duh oh  
I'm up all night, gettin' my money right  
Until the blue and white's  
Po po po po po po  
Now the money comin' slow  
But at least a nigga know slow motion better then  
No No No  
  
It's all good in the hood like  
Rags and Timbs  
Throwbacks and Timbs  
Blacks and Rims  
Whether on ball courts and tires of all sorts  
We never fall short  
With us, it's all force  
Like And 1's someway some hand guns  
The days the fam one is all over for  
Cash is colder than fobolobo  
But self I go toe to toe  
Wonderin' if it's for the art of for the dough  
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go  
Though I know the dough I gotta bring back to the ghetto  
Arrows on tarot cards pointing to the grind  
More livin in more prisons  
Pointing to my mind  
Shine the light up  
Clench my fist tight holdin' the right up  
Freedom fightin dark year for the years to get brighter  
Situations that jaws get tighter  
My man tried to get his way...  
  
I walked in the crib  
Got two kids  
And my baby mamma late  
Uh oh uh oh uh oh  
And so I had to did what I had to did  
Cuz I had the kid  
Duh oh duh oh duh oh  
Up all night, gettin' my money right  
Until the blue and white's  
Po po po po po po  
Now the money comin' slow  
But at least a nigga know slow motion better then  
No No No  
  
Hey yo I, I know I could make it right  
If I could just swallow my pride  
But I can't run away  
You put my gun away  
You can't front on me  
I, no I can't let it ride  
No no not tonight  
No I can't run away  
You put my gun away  
You can't front on me


(Gonna take you to the glory, oh I can't study war)  
Now where the south side, now where the west side  
  
Can I talk my shit again?  
Even if I don't hit again?  
Dog are you fucking kidding?  
My hat, my shoes, my coat  
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace  
That's Louis Vuitton's bitch  
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone  
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning  
Class back in session so I upped it a grade  
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade  
And, hey please don't start me  
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley  
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers  
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up  
I touched on everything  
Married to the game, roc-a-chain instead of a wedding ring  
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter  
On nights when 'Ye romance  
Cameras flash so much  
That I gotta do that Yayo dance  
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man  
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van it's easy  
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy  
And, oh yeah, Yeezy  
I did it for the glory  
  
Now where the south side, now where the west side  
  
What am I supposed to do now?  
Man the game all messed up  
How I'm suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up?  
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta  
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido  
But with my ego  
I can stand there in a speedo  
And be looked at like a fucking hero  
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night  
The grind, the empty bottles of no-doze  
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo  
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos  
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss  
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss  
Why I gotta ask what that two-door cost  
House on the hill  
Two doors from Tracey Ross  
And I'm asking about her girlfriends  
Yeah, the dark skinny ones  
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em  
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?  
I know, I know I look better in real life  
O' hear people compare themselves to big a lot  
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot  
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG  
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious, fit in  
Get money and stunt and stay glorious  
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit  
  
Now where the south side, now where the west side  
  
Yeah I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit  
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory
