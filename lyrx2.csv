[Verse 1]  
Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will  
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm...  
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal  
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill  
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, just save that for your shit  
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit  
Like Soulja, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen  
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician  
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Meyers  
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'  
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic  
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift  
  
[Hook]  
Work the night shift  
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift  
Work, work the night shift  
  
[Verse 2]  
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing  
I'm old, you gotta know  
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold  
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes  
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll  
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again  
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend  
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'  
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public  
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again  
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN  
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced  
It's nothin' like this  
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift  
  
[Hook]  
Work the night shift  
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift  
Work, work the night shift  
  
[Outro]  
If you were worried about where  
I've been or who I saw or  
What club I went to with the homies  
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me  
I'm never worried about where  
I'm at or who I saw or  
What club I went to with the homies  
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me


Feat. Gucci Mane  
  
[Gucci Mane:]  
I'm so fucking dumb I wrote "diamonds" on my thumbs,  
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,  
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,  
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,  
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,  
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,  
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,  
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,  
And I might like you for a minute,  
But I don't like your friends in my business,  
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,  
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Uh uhhhhhhh,  
I know you say you love me girl,  
I know you say you love me girl,  
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,  
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,  
  
[Drake:]  
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,  
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,  
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,  
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,  
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,  
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,  
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,  
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,  
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,  
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,  
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,  
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,  
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,  
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,  
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,  
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Uh uhhhhhhh,  
I know you say you love me girl,  
I know you say you love me girl,  
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,  
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you


You know a lot of girls be  
Thinking my songs are about them  
This is not to get confused  
This ones for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted  
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it  
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it  
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it  
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up  
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up  
She make me beg for it, till she give it up  
And I say the same thing every single time  
I say,  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You the da best I ever had,  
Best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
I say you da fuckin'  
  
Know you gotta roommate,  
Call me when there's no one there,  
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (yup)  
I be over there, shawty I be over there  
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there  
And you don't even have to ask twice,  
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice  
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life  
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life  
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on  
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong  
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along  
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home  
And she a patient in my waiting room,  
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume  
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit  
  
Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,  
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk  
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture  
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister  
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue  
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial  
She call me the referee cause I be so official  
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle  
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,  
And who told you to put them jeans on  
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on  
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on  
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot  
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot  
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop  
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot  
  
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted  
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it  
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it  
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it  
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up  
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up  
She make me beg for it, till she give it up  
And I say the same thing every single time  
I say,  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da best I ever had,  
Best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
I say,  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da fuckin' best  
You da best I ever had,  
Best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
  
Uh, ah yea  
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody  
Just make sure they that special somebody  
Young money, yeah yeah  
You know who you are, I got ya


This here is on some truthful shit  
It seems like everything I do, your used to it  
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with  
That's when I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside  
So you still think I'm confident and damn  
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastool  
Are we moving too fast?  
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past  
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?  
  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
  
This here is something personal  
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible  
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know  
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside  
So I don?t ever question you and damn  
I can't even find, the perfect brush  
So I can paint what's going through my mind  
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind  
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?  
  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Brand new girl  
  
Is anything I'm doing brand new  
Is everything I'm doing too late  
  
Did he take off your clothes off just like this  
Did he give you loving just like this  
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date  
Tell me baby am I too late?


[Verse:]  
Word on road, it's the clique about to blow  
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know  
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low  
But it's cool, know you heard it all before  
  
[Hook:]  
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me  
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)  
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me  
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team  
Man these niggas got to stop it they be crowding up the scene  
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem  
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines  
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
It look like we in love, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies  
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires  
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me  
Before I'm on the next thing, ymcmb (ah)  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team  
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene  
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned  
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene  
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
It might look like I care, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies  
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all ties  
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, new kid with the crown  
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)  
  
[Outro:]  
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team (ay)  
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team (ay)


We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon  
And nothing was the same  
  
Watch me, going out of the way  
When I should've went home  
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own  
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,  
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way  
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past  
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh  
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask  
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something  
  
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
So get your ass in that car and come thru  
  
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
So get your ass in that car and come thru  
  
Last night I brought DOA to the studio  
They already had a stage and a booty pole  
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on  
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on  
Someone put a order in for a chicken (For a chicken)  
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (Need the kitchen)  
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up  
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?  
Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?  
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?  
And ya know I need ya back in my life  
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like  
Girl you got that thing for real  
When I was on a mission to make it  
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?  
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?  
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something  
  
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
Girl you know we got thangs to do  
So get your ass in that car and come thru  
  
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru  
Girl you know we got thangs to do

So get your ass in that car and come thru  
  
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?  
Why has it been? (Why has it been so long?) Why has it been?  
Who you been crying to? (Why has it been so long?) Who you been flying to?

[Drake]  
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele  
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli  
The fuck are you trying to tell me?  
Bothers me when you got to play therapist  
That shit's embarrassin'  
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison  
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150  
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy  
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney  
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding  
Is this even still a discussion?  
Don't you ever wake up disgusted?  
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin  
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became somethin'  
Girls that becoming ladies  
And my friends are having babies  
And babies are dropping dead in my city  
This shit is crazy  
And I don't know if speaking on it helps  
This the shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself  
You know  
  
Can't you talk to me  
Lets talk about it, talk about it  
Tell me what you need  
Just tell me baby, tell me baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

(Wassup)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah  
(Wassup)  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah  
(Yea wassup)  
  
Came too far to give up  
Gotta try, cause I can't do it on my own  
Can't you talk to me  
Tell me what you need  
Can't you talk to me  
Tell me what you need


Somewhere between psychotic and iconic  
Somewhere between I want it and I got it  
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted  
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment  
But I stay down, girl I always stay down  
Get down, have her lay down  
Promise to break everybody off before I break down  
Everyone just wait now  
So much on my plate now  
People I believed in they don't even show they face now  
What they got to say now?  
Nothin' they can say now  
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now  
What more can I say now?  
What more can I say now?  
You might feel like nothin' was the same  
  
I still been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I still been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
I just been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I just been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya  
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya  
You know that paper my passion  
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened  
I can't help it  
I can't help it  
I was young and I was selfish  
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's  
And now you hate me  
Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'  
I can't take it  
Girl don't treat me like a stranger  
Girl you know I seen ya naked  
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender  
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together  
You know I stay remniscin'  
And makeup sex is tradition  
But you been missin' girl  
And you might feel like nothin' was the same  
  
I still been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I still been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
I just been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I just been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'  
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money  
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin', schemin'  
Plottin', schemin', getting money  
  
This the life for me  
My mama told me this was right for me  
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me  
I should have Spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me  
Your actions make us doubt you  
Your lack of effort got me rapping different  
This the shit I wanna go out to  
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'  
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living  
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling  
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us  
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up  
Yours truly the boy  
I just build and build more  
Y'all niggas build and destroy  
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record  
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before  
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to, yeah  
This the shit I wanna go out to


I might be too strung out on compliments  
Overdosed on confidence  
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence  
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments  
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness  
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that  
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that  
I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that  
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at  
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that  
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that  
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that  
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that  
No, don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in  
And we all go through it  
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it  
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it  
That's just something they know  
  
[Chorus]  
They know, they know, they know  
They know, they know, they know  
They know, they know, they know  
Yeah they know yeah  
That the real is on the rise  
Fuck them other guys  
I even gave them a chance to decide  
Now it's something they know  
They know, they know, they know  
  
Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind  
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty  
Tell her I apologize it happened over time  
She says they missed the old Drake, girl don't tempt me  
If they don't get it, they'll be over you  
That new shit that you got is overdue  
You better do what you suppose to do  
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's
true  
Listen to you expressing all them feelings  
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children  
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing  
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions  
You know the game even got it like that  
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that  
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that  
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)  
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)  
They know


Drake:  
I got my eyes on you  
You're everything that I see  
I want your hot love, emotion endlessly  
I can't get over you, left your mark on me  
I want your hot love, emotion endlessly  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
Just hold on, we're goin' home  
Just hold on, we're goin' home  
It's hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on, we're goin' home, home  
  
Jhene:  
What's up  
Been a minute since we kicked it  
You been caught up  
With these chicks and I don't get it, you're a star love  
You shouldn't have to deal with that  
I never make you feel like that  
Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us  
That's why you trust me  
You been through more than most of us  
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?  
Darlin' you, you give but you cannot take love.  
  
Drake:  
I needed to hear that, I hate when you're submissive  
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance  
I look around the peers that surround me, these boys are trippin'  
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different  
Started realizin' a couple places I could take it  
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement  
I want to take it deeper than money, vacation  
And influence a generation that's lackin' in patience  
I've been dealin' with my dad, speakin' of lack of patience  
Just me and my old man gettin' back to basics  
We've been talkin' 'bout the future and time that we wasted  
When he put that bottle down, girl that man is amazin'  
Well, we had a couple Coronas  
We might have rolled a white paper, just somethin' to hold us  
We even talked about you in our couple of moments  
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups  
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone  
Lookin' like you came from the 70's on your own  
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is  
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?  
You don't even know what you want from love anymore  
I search for somethin' I'm missin', it disappear when I'm bored  
But girl, what qualities was I lookin' for before?  
Who you settlin' for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  
  
Jhene:

Jhene:

So that we can make love


[Drake]  
All my exes live in texas like I'm george strait  
Or they go to georgia state where-  
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta  
That she only see when she feels obligated  
Admitted it to me the first time we dated  
But she was no angel, and we never waited  
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck  
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it  
And we never talk too much after I blew up  
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'  
And I think I text her and told her I made it  
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it  
And that's when I text her and told her I love it  
And right after texting, told her I'm faded  
She asked  
What have I learned since getting richer  
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures  
I learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture  
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya  
Damn, is it the fall  
Time for me to revisit the past  
It's women to call  
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved  
There's stories to tell, we been through it all  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions  
Like:  
  
[Bridge: lil wayne]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?  
And I say  
  
(And I say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
  
[Lil wayne]  
So much for being optimistic  
They say love is in the air, so I  
Hold my breath until my face turn purple  
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle  
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew  
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you  
I flew jet, she flew commercial  
But we still met, later that night  
After my session, she came over  
I was aggressive, and she was sober  
I gave her pills  
She started confessing and started undressing  
And ask me to hold her  
And so I did, but that was last month  
And now she's texting me, asking for closure  
Damn  
She say this shit gon' catch up to me  
I keep tissue paper  
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table  
She say she hate that she love me  
And she wish I was average  
Shit, sometimes I wish the same  
And I wish she wasn't married  
Promises, I hope I never break 'em  
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like  
  
[Bridge:]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?  
  
[Hook:]  
(And I say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin right, all right  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Damn right, all right  
  
[Drake]  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Damn right, all right  
Aw yeah

Flash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast,  
I know you get impatient as the time pass  
You say you want it fast... define fast  
'Cause I can speed it up, and make it last  
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast  
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past,  
And make damn sure you never forget it  
Committed  
I'm ready, I'm with it... still here like a statue  
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,  
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too  
Plus I got a sex pistol, pointed right at you "BANG!"  
The baddest women ever and the hardest out,  
Proven over and over again that's why I'm hard to doubt  
Plus I'm Young Money 'till the death, I took the carter route  
I'm more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about  
  
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.  
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.

Well listen and respect mann the city owes us one bag.  
All these old hands keep their minds on one track.

Roll around with nikko, party with a zukka.

Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin me but I got love for everybody

Bright light, city lights downtown every night,  
Never has to think twice,  
Only does what she likes,  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!  
  
All right!  
She'll be jumping up and down,  
Trying to fit that ass in.  
Took her half an hour just to get that...  
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion,  
I don't know where she's going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Cause this baby is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me!  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key...  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
Bright light, city lights downtown every night,  
Never has to think twice,  
Only does what she likes,  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!  
  
Don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,  
Kinda' hard to concentrate when the cameras are flashing.  
All the dudes suffocate her, I don't wanna grasp in,  
Don't know where she's going, and I do not plan on asking at all!  
I've never been the type to... My connection  
With niggaare that wanna fight over women, that's not right,  
There's too many in the world, homie you could...  
But I swear that was my girl, I swear it was my girl!  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
Bright light, city lights downtown every night,  
Never has to think twice,  
Only does what she likes,  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!  
  
Yeah, she works hard, but she plays even harder,  
All-star weekend and she's been voted my favorite starter.  
... On the back of a jersey, so you won't forget it,  
But she shines bright, blind them light  
So that... Forget it.  
Just one life to live, the kind of life I will...  
And if I don't see her tonight, the rest of my life I will regret it!  
She's not perfect, but she's just perfect to me,  
Like it's a highway, let's ride it, you know in a second with me1  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
Bright light, city lights downtown every night,  
Never has to think twice,  
Only does what she likes,  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!  
What she wants, what she needs,  
She's my independent queen!


Yeh, ah... Ah  
Boy wonder... Drizzy  
Ah... Ah... Uh  
  
Yall aint really like me  
I can understand  
My flow is sitting right inside da pocket on ma pants  
I'm still fly, you can't float  
Run this ship, you same boat  
A write your favorite records, aah, you singin thoses  
20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote  
I'm getting rich, aah, you staying broke  
Chilling if even if I'm in a goosed down coat  
I cant' see you through the Mosley Tribes  
So I don't even flinch when you throw me hi fives  
They try to measure up, but there's no my size  
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes  
Beast mode on them, a never take a night off  
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off  
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off  
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off  
Cuz It's about to go...  
  
Beat plays  
  
I hear ma phone ringing when they call  
I aint picking up or entertaining them at all  
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall  
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall  
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmmmmm  
I cannot relate  
Riding with some tags that a got from out-a-state  
Riding with a swag that a got from out-a-space  
Just show me who's the hottest Ima knock him out his place  
Call me homeside drizzy, about to kill your ego  
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like I'm celo  
You can go and take a glance at your hero  
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero  
Fantasy to you, reality to me  
And yeah ma g-pass is as valid as can be  
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree  
Waving at your girl  
While she's smiling back at me like...


Things have been so crazy and hectic, I should have got her back by now  
But you know how much I wanted to make it, It's probably better anyhow  
So if you gotta go, if there's anything I should know  
If the spotlight makes you nervous  
If you're looking for a purpose  
You put the tea in the kettle and light it  
Put your hand on the metal and feel it  
But do you even feel it anymore?  
I remember when you thought I was joking  
Now I'm off singing karaoke  
Farther than I've ever been  
So if you gotta go, if there's any way I can help  
  
Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner?  
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta? Damn  
Of all the places you could go  
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know  
I'm always up too late, I worry about you there alone  
And that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron  
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy  
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady  
I know they say the first love is the sweetest  
But that first cut is the deepest  
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets  
You were telling everybody but me  
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky  
I'm surprised you couldn't tell  
  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous  
And you're looking for a purpose  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous


[Intro]  
Wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets  
Y'all sleepin' in the streets  
Shaky warrior  
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know  
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?  
  
[Verse 1]  
Yeah, yeah  
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
Countin' money you know how it goes  
Pray the real live forever man  
Pray the fakes get exposed  
I want that ferrari then I swerve  
I want that bugatti just to hurt  
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose  
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it  
I don't like how serious they take themselves  
I've always been me I guess I know myself  
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that  
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that  
This been where you find me at  
That's been where you find me at  
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling  
He put me on to the finer things  
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans  
I had a yellow TechnoMarine  
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks  
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback  
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags  
  
[Hook]  
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't fuck with them niggas they too irrational  
This is that nasty flow  
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international  
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie  
Yeah, and you know how that shit go  
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road  
Yeah but you know how that shit go  
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up  
They wanna mash it up, woah  
My nigga [?] he whip it I ride in the passenger  
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up  
I had to get back to you, woah  
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women  
Like twenty four seven, that's where my life took me  
That's just how shit happened to go  
  
[Hook]  
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
You know how that shit go  
  
[Outro]  
She know it, it a no big  
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out  
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man  
No bomboclat, otha  
And if a boy like  
OVO crew my nigga can just suck ya motha  
With no apology, I cannot [?]  
Yeah girl I say we cute, if they dis we get execute  
That's the truth, OVO unruly  
  
(machine gun shots)  
  
With my woes


I've been up for four days  
Getting money both ways  
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades  
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades  
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age  
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you  
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true  
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying  
I'm just here making all the music that they party to  
But party on, party on, all night nigga  
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga  
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars  
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire  
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth  
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot  
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park  
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose  
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target  
But a target nonetheless and I just started  
Was that directed at moi? Can't be  
They must be talking to themselves hoe, hands free  
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner  
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner  
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music  
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar  
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you  
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,  
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you  
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit' you  
Don't get impatient when it takes too long  
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong  
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me  
Promise to always give you me, the real me  
  
Who would have thought  
I'd be caught in this life?  
Let's celebrate with a toast  
And get lost in tonight  
And make it all light up  
(Hey, Guru, tell home girl to go to open that Ace right there),  
Wait until the sun goes down  
We gon' make this bitch light up  
Even when the sun goes down  
I'm gon' make this go  
  
Ow, hoes turn they heads like, owls  
I'm the man of the hour  
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how  
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power  
Bright life'd make your whole city light up  
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub  
I just landed in that G450  
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy  
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk  
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk  
I don't do too much blogging  
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'  
(Uh) I ain't got a scar yet  
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched  
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you  
Will silly raps feuds tryin' to distract you  
In disguise, in the form of a favor  
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors  
(Uh) I done seen it all, done it all  
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off  
The summer's ours, the winter too  
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do  
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7  
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you  
And since no good deed go unpunished  
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was  
I once was, cool as The Fonz was  
But these bright lights turned me to a monster  
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me  
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me  
Fuck niggas, bitches too  
All I got is this money, this'll do  
  
Who would have thought  
I'd be caught in this life?  
Let's celebrate with a toast  
And get lost in tonight  
And make it all light up  
Wait until the sun goes down  
We gon' make this bitch light up  
Wait until the sun goes down  
I'm gon' make this go


I like a woman with a future and a past  
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last  
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast  
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that  
Only you can do it just like that  
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower  
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and you'll always be the one  
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl  
Maybe it's just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl  
They want you in their life as a wife  
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest  
Why you want to fight for your right  
'Cause you don't love them boys  
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise  
  
[Chorus]  
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go  
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?  
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine  
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time  
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you  
  
B-b-b-b-bet I am  
All of them bitches I'm badder than  
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in  
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'  
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say  
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'  
I'm a star, sheriff badge  
What's the point if I'm guarding?  
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are


I forgot about you last night  
For the first time in a long time I Didddd  
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on makin  
In amazin conversation with this girl named lorraine  
Who says she's from L. A.  
Who keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay  
Ooohhhh  
She could be good for me (yeahhh)  
This what you text me  
Tell me that you miss me  
I forget about Lorraine  
And in fact she's right here with me  
And she's starin at my face  
Something that could change  
Thought that all these feelings went away (yeahh)  
  
I hate gettin messages from youuuu (fromm youuu)  
It's like you know the perfect shit to say  
Thought that all these feelings went away  
  
I forgot about you last night  
For the first time in a long time I Didddd  
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on makin  
In amazin conversation with this girl named lorraine

Who keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay  
Ooohhhh  
She could be good for me (yeahhh)

[Intro]  
Yeah, that's about it  
This shit sound like what being rich feel like  
Fo real  
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it  
Too much going on  
Too much, too much, too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
You, you, you  
Make me wanna take ya down through there  
Make me wanna take ya down through there  
I'll take it down  
  
[Hook 1]  
Why you never come to where I stay?  
Always hiding out in your New York condo  
Why you never come to where I stay?  
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know  
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense  
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?  
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?  
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man  
Aw man, aw man  
Aw, man  
  
[Verse]  
Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch  
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up  
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
Start to think I got to get it how I live  
We too busy for a wedding or a kid  
If I'm working then I know you working  
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous  
I empower girls that don't deserve it  
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose  
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6  
  
[Hook 2]  
You don't ever come to where I stay  
You just rather stay up in your New York condo  
You don't ever come to where I stay  
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know  
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
You know how sticky these situation get  
You go up higher than me some days  
You know what I think we could be some day  
Let me at least show you my side of things, man  
Aw man, aw man  
Aw man


[Hook]  
Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open em'

Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced  
Got the club going up on a Tuesday  
True say, I been going hard but then again  
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent  
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him  
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man  
I gotta blunt, can I get a light?  
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right  
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed  
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"  
Dog, just bought a island gotta sail to it  
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it  
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it someone gotta do it  
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it  
  
[Hook]  
Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open em'

[Verse 2]  
I had to switch the flow up on you niggas  
The shit was gettin' too predictable  
The new shit on steroids, I would never pass a physical  
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah  
I mean we hear about the money you be gettin' but we just never see a visual  
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah  
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)  
What's the word these days?  
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know  
Buncha' out of season woman fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season
wardrobe  
All the rappers that you vouch for need to get out of the house more, they
washed up  
And even if the team was religious with it, I can't really see another squad
tryna' cross us, nah  
  
Ovo unruly  
One shot to make it in a life  
From the six to the fucking [?]  
  
[Hook]  
Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open em'

[Outro]

[Hook: Drake]  
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)

All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)  
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)  
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum  
(They do, they do)  
And I like to finish what you think you started  
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started  
You don't know what you just started  
All I do is hang with the young and heartless  
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest  
It's all I ever did and look where it got him  
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately  
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me  
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way  
But you know I always handle that one my way  
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body  
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway  
I can't trust no fuckin' body  
They still out to get me cause they never got me  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
They still out to get me, I don't get it  
I can not be got, and that's a given  
Give a real nigga the number one  
Even though I got like twenty-one  
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one  
Schooling your ass like 101  
They been out here tryna slide on me  
They been out here telling lies on me  
Everybody looking out for themself  
But they still got they eyes on me  
See me putting in the hard work now, aye  
Momma doesn't have to call work now, aye  
I decide when I start work now, aye  
Problems hit the gym, they all work out  
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen  
Even next season looking like a breeze  
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah  
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah  
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed  
And you don't know what you started  
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist  
I can't trust no fuckin' body  
They still out to get me cause they never got me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)  
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)  
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)  
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)


[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]  
I'm in Miami  
I need to call up Miss Cassidy

Sorry for the miscommunication

You know what I'm trying to do  
Hey let's pop the E off at Liv I've got some time here to blow  
I've got the money to blow

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]  
Young nigga preach  
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach (X3)

[Verse 2: Drake]  
Still in Miami  
Most of these girls are too messy  
I've got to do some reflecting  
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction  
I'm convinced that my calls are being recorded  
So hit my assistant to get me the message  
And make the connection like brrrrr  
I'm on my way tonight I hope you not the crazy type yeah  
I'm in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight  
PND ain't with the ray tay tay  
You know Jay Ray  
Got girls her going way way way way way way  
Sauga city trip the pay day  
Load up off a gate way  
Man you can't afford me  
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story  
Niggas is all in their feelings these days, all in their feelings these days  
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid  
  
[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]


(feat. Trey Songz)  
  
[Echo-Trey Songz]  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement  
  
[Verse 1-Drake]  
Lat me show what it is  
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map  
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap  
If you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like  
[Trey]  
Ooo wee  
[Drake]  
Took 'em from white snakes to  
[Trey]  
Ooo wee  
[Drake]  
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but  
[Trey]  
Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah  
[Drake]  
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in  
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at
amazing'  
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us  
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is  
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious  
What you really expect when I strut through town  
Two or three days I shut you down  
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz  
You call him the prince he rep two up two down  
Anyone I know get used to me  
I'm far from the man that I used to be  
I don't ever really kick game  
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me  
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that  
Need good lovin' I'm providing that  
Understand that I'm worldwide  
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at  
'Cause I do things from the M-town  
To the uk  
From Spain back out to Texas  
This album's for my fans  
But yo this hook is for my exes  
  
[Chorus-Trey Songz]  
This one is for you girl  
You know who you are girl  
You only show you're face  
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl  
What you trying to to make it  
Don't ever mistake it  
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you  
You had a chance now It's gone  
Oooooh  
You had a man now you don't  
Back to the basics  
I think I made it  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl  
  
[Verse 2-Trey Songz]  
Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly  
Lookin for someone your type  
I done left behind the love of my life  
Tryin to find another one tonight  
And if it's you baby  
Let yourself be seen  
Don matter skirts  
Dresses or jeans  
I got that work  
Know what I mean  
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3-Drake]  
Check this out  
From the that she get picked for some take out  
Until they slip up and break out  
But it's another story over here at Drake's house  
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out  
And I'm lean back  
Scoping  
Looking for a woman that I should wife  
Who got just the right amount of loyalty  
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life  
We go la, va  
Ny, to  
Sunshine in that heat stroke  
And them fur hoods in that deep snow  
We have breakfast in the bedroom  
Break bread downstairs in the basement  
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more  
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay  
Ay, Ay, Ay  
Let's Go


[Hook]  
You're my right hand, you're my go to  
Told me everything about you  
That's a bold move  
I know that you're out here  
And there's things you gotta go through  
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do  
And they never will  
  
[Verse 1]  
But I swear you gotta chill  
You wanna grip Benz wheel  
And I know you can't wait  
You dream big and sleep late  
You got a lot on your plate  
That's why you're always working out  
Taking pictures of yourself  
You don't see anybody else  
You're like oh well  
You're like fuck it oh well  
My past behind me like a pony tail  
  
[Hook]  
But you're my right hand, you're my go to  
Told me everything about you  
That's a bold move  
I know that you're out here  
And there's things you gotta go through  
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do  
And they never will  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ok I know you want the Audi  
I know you want to go to Maui  
You and all your girlfriends  
The ones you never bring around me  
Cause you don't trust me like your last man  
Did he open doors for ya?  
Buy the things he can't afford for ya  
Cause he must have did a lot for ya  
I just fell back with it  
And now your past is behind you  
Like the car with the strap in it  
Thank god that's finished  
Cause now it's back to business  
Any more henny and you're past the limit  
You told me about the picture  
Now you have to send it  
I would never put you on blast when I get it  
  
[Hook]  
You're my right hand, you're my go to  
Told me everything about you  
That's a bold move  
I know that you're out here  
And there's things you gotta go through  
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do  
And they never will


Hey there material girl  
The neighbors told me that you're moving out  
Leaving to witness the world  
But are you sure that's what you're doing now  
  
Are you running away for a purpose  
Do you even know what your self worth is  
The past what you carry in your purses  
The gift in the curse when you going head first is  
The atl, mia, lax, jfk  
Luggage all packed and to them I say  
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you've lost  
You're waking up every day  
The run away, run away girl  
I turn and your gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
The run away, the run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye  
Good day  
Be on  
Your way  
Run away girl  
(X2)  
  
Watching it all through the window  
And wishing you could make is shatter now  
Now that you're here on the other side  
Are you sure it even matters  
  
Are you living the dream  
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems  
Do you strip do you model do you live in between  
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you lost  
You're waking up every day  
To run away, run away girl  
I turn and you're gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
You run away, run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye  
Good day  
Be on your way  
Run away girl  
(X2)


Why do I feel so alone?  
Like everybody passing through the studio  
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I don't have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
It's hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipo'd  
Always said I'd say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I can't live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
That's married I ain't miss  
24 hours from greatness  
I'm that close  
Don't ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin' whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown  
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus  
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how  
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
I've always been something that these labels can't buy  
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly"  
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know"  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on 'em?  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on 'em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And that's what happens  
When you spitting what's inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me  
'Cause to have known me would  
Mean that there's a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me  
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3  
Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy  
I'm just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand  
I could get money with my eyes closed  
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know  
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will  
I got new shit  
I'm gettin' better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal  
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill  
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel  
Problem with these other niggas they  
Ain't never real  
Yea that's all I can say


[Intro]  
Doin' well dog  
Yeah, me and all my  
Yeah, me

Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog  
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog  
  
[Verse 1]  
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston  
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions  
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions  
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra  
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son, tho  
Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds, tho  
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at  
How they feel about you, where you're from, where your bed at  
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that  
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that  
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time, tho  
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know  
  
[Hook]  
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog  
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog  
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog  
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh, and I'm back, dog  
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog  
I thought that we were family  
You showed me that we can't be  
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me  
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me  
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted  
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
6 point star, Lion of the Judah  
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci  
One do it then we all gotta do it  
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it  
Whole city at your head for the boy  
I ain't even gotta call no one for it  
  
[Hook]  
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog  
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog  
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog  
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still -  
  
[Outro]  
Wow, all praise to the most high up


[Chorus]  
I did it all on my own,  
Turned a chair to a throne,  
I'm a king in this world,  
(Stunt hard)  
I put my whole city on,  
To some things that they never would've known,  
If I didn't,  
(Stunt hard)  
And every night is a premiere,  
If I ever disappear,  
Best believe I'm comin' back.  
(Stunt hard)  
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,  
On that same shit again,  
All I ever do is,  
(Stunt hard)  
  
(Drake):  
I tell her.  
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.  
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.  
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who Is He",  
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.  
And I'm focused on my survival.  
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.  
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.  
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.  
I'm everything you just haven't become.  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.  
Now hopefully let them see,  
What they say that I'm gon' be,  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.  
Get your team in order, assembly is key.  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.  
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.  
But I'm just trying to swerve.  
Without hitting the curb.  
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.  
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.  
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.  
Yeah.  
The Chris Paul  
Of this fall,  
Sittin' this tall.  
I float high,  
Goodbye,  
I will miss y'all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Lil' Wayne):  
If I don't do nothin', Imma stunt my ass off.  
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.  
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.  
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.  
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil.  
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.  
I'm a young rebel.  
And I got a baby face.  
I need a young pebbles.  
I need a stuntdouble.  
Yeah!  
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.  
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.  
Yeah!  
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.  
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.  
Yeah!  
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes  
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.  
Yeah!  
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.  
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.  
Yeah!  
I'm on the cup of that tilt.  
And if you hatin' on me  
I'll say fuck you like wilt.  
Yeah!  
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.  
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace.  
Yeah!  
Talkin' big big shit.  
I am rude,  
I take food,  
From a kid picnic.  
Nigga.  
Yeah!  
And we can bang like bumper cars.  
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all stunner bars.  
Haha.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Nutt Da Kid):  
I stunt hard. I stunt harder.  
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.  
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.  
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.  
I hustle harder.  
I live in the Carter.  
I think forward,  
All I see is tomorrow.  
I need me.  
I'll turn your shop into a horror.  
So if you trying to see more  
Better feed me.  
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.  
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur.  
And the feds will never get me,  
Like a backwards,  
Password,  
Black spur,  
Go some like Pacman, cats first.  
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister  
Ask her,  
Am I their man,  
Her answer,  
Is yes sir.  
Shit.  
I'm tourin' states on stage,  
I played the RTA  
'Bout a quarter a day.  
Now tell them bitches.  
  
[Chorus]


It's ten o'clock on a wednesday and I know your home  
Driving up and down your street hoping that you come outside  
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted  
And I just need you to see me alone  
Childish as it seems it'll make it all better... Better  
Selfish as it is this just ain't about you no...  
Did me wrong eveytime we were together... Gether  
And that's why...  
  
I'm gonna stunt on you  
I'm gonna stunt on you  
  
You let me go...  
Little did you know...  
I could have made it all on my own...


[Intro]  
Girl I know you wanna, you know I wanna  
Yeah, she keep giving me looks  
Hotter than the 6 in the summer, that ass, girl I wanna  
  
[Verse 1]  
Girl I know you wanna  
You know I wanna  
Yeah, she keep giving me looks  
Yeah, girl I know you wanna  
She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama  
She heard the ting bend like banana  
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
She say I'm a sweeterman  
But she say that she don't need a man  
I say why don't we make an agreement then  
We can just fuck while we're being friends  
  
[Hook]  
Girl I know you wanna  
You know I wanna  
Girl I know you wanna  
You know I wanna  
  
[Verse 2]  
Shawty too fly though, that's all I know  
She don't sing songs, but if I go strong she gon' hit this high note  
She know she working with the nana  
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
She say I'm a sweeterman  
But she say that she don't need a man  
What if we make an agreement then  
We can just fuck while we're being friends  
  
[Hook]  
Girl I know you wanna  
I know you wanna  
Girl I know you wanna  
I know you want to girl  
  
[Verse 3]  
Ride the pipe like a bike, oh  
Do the things you know I like, oh  
I'm the man in my ends, oh  
You're the one, let's not pretend  
  
[Bridge]  
Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong  
Yiy too change, I'm too sprung, I, I, I  
The pussy too good, drink too strong  
Yiy too change, I'm so gone, I, I, I  
  
[Hook]  
Girl I know you wanna  
I know you wanna  
Girl I know you wanna  
I know you want to girl  
Girl I know you wanna  
I know you want to girl  
Girl I know you wanna, I, I, I  
  
[Verse 4]  
She keep giving me looks (o,o,o)  
She keep giving me looks (o,o,o)  
I need you right here beside me  
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement  
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me  
It would be different without me  
What is it without me  
Don't go do nothing without me  
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi  
I swear my life story's better than stories they telling about me  
They got it twisted  
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance  
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?  
Maybe you just had to realize  
That knowing the difference can make all the difference  
She wanna ride me that adanunana  
Yeah she keep giving me looks


Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
I've asked about you and they've told me things  
But my mind didn't change  
I still the feel the same  
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know  
We know, they don't get you like I will  
My only wish is I die real  
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal  
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still  
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case  
Big girls all get a little taste  
Pushing me away so I give her space  
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break  
I'll be there for you, I will care for you  
I keep thanking you, just don't know  
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that  
On your face girl, it just don't show  
When you're ready, just say you're ready  
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy  
And the parties over, just don't forget me  
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow  
You won't ever have to worry,  
You won't ever have to hide  
And you seen all my mistakes  
So look me in my eyes  
  
Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
It's my birthday, I get high if I want to  
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to  
Cause you don't say you love me  
To your friends when they ask you  
Even though we both know that you do (you do)  
One time, been in love one time  
You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you're following your heart  
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know  
We know,  
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you  
Instead they say  
  
Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost


I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring  
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement  
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction  
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum  
I am the kid with the motor mouth  
I am the one that you should worry about  
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?  
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around  
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down  
I don't waste time putting money down  
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash  
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first
class  
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city  
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever  
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it  
  
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell  
I will never understand that but oh well  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"  
Okay, now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language  
Now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"  
  
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited  
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited  
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence  
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do  
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through  
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple  
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me  
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to
me  
Hate when they get too attached to me  
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road  
Get what I can out the country and then I just get on the jet and go back to
the cold  
Can't even drive with the top off  
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer  
I just might bring in some girls from Miami  
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it  
  
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell  
I will never understand that but oh well  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"  
Okay, now you're talking my language now you're talking my language  
Now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"  
  
Famous and gangstas  
You understand me?  
Showtime, headlines  
Big time, sunshine, tote nines  
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind  
High life, stay fly it's jet time  
Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga  
Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga  
Stunt nigga, swag on head to feet nigga  
Stunt nigga,  
I might just bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city and that's
word to Stunna you know it


Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.  
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.  
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye,  
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.  
You can stay but shawty here I go  
  
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?  
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.  
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.  
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.  
I am, still here with who I started with.  
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.  
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.  
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.  
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.  
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.  
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a florist,  
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous.  
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.  
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.  
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.  
I'm trying to do better than good enough.  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.  
But people I don't have the time to hang with,  
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)  
You promised me you would never change.  
You promised me you would never change.  
  
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.  
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.  
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.  
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.  
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.  
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.  
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,  
That I barley know at all and,  
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected  
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.  
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.  
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,  
I'm holding on by a thread it's,  
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,  
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.  
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,  
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.  
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.  
Which made me question when I went missing.  
And when I start treating my friends different.  
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.  
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.  
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.  
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.  
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.  
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.  
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.  
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.  
Did I just trade free time for camera time?  
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?  
I just need some closure.  
Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.


(Feat. Saukrates)  
  
[Intro: Saukrates]  
(They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all)  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Hip-Hop's newest and youngest acquisition,  
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position.  
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference,  
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen.  
I go from records with Dwele and LB and eLZhi,  
The meetings where they tell me to  
Start making records and t hey'll buy,  
Now I'm at in A-Town,  
A tellin' me trey sounds,  
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' a-round.  
But the allure of this year's scream tour  
Has been cuttin' all them jawns that be hurtin' the game.  
I be dreamin' bout hoes and doin' them loud shows,  
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train.  
Dog, personally maine,  
I'm a person that came to bring purpose  
To a seem unless they purpose is game.  
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame,  
Now my thoughts getting' deeper and I'm searchin' the game,  
I keep on, on, on, on, on  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all  
  
[Verse 2: Saukrates]  
Yeah.  
Let me show you how to blast up,  
Now tell me who is a masta.  
A mind never wasted,  
Who grows fasta.  
The young and incredible while lightin' yo ass up,  
You look a lil red, we getting that cash up.  
See where we from,  
The 50s are bloody and the 100-dollar bill  
Is dirty brown they love me.  
I mess up my livin' room, the studio with my money,  
A g-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of,  
My lapel, is custom-made,  
You off the rack shit,  
I'm off the chain, come on.  
The dogs are loose,  
And yeah we get at themon like san frisco bay,  
With 40 and mac dre.  
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to  
Me or one of my folk,  
Drake'll give you the deal.  
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills,  
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill.  
Keep on, keep on (uh), keep on (uh), keep on (uh)  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all  
  
[Verse 3: Drake]  
Look, uh  
I use to get 'em like murda murda,  
Ol' time killin'.  
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin',  
And now the girls like,  
It's only drake got chased and so the artists  
I respected try and take my place,  
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin',  
They one in the same when you need it to happen.  
My city full of players they just needed a captain,  
In-need of him right now and needed him him back then.  
But back then I was act-in',  
Now-a-days I serve back-hands with back-spin.  
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men,  
Whoever chose to back out is back in,  
They say there's two sides to every story  
And three when the truth get told,  
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold.  
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old.  
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold.  
And keep on, on, on, on, on  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all


All I care about is money and the city that I'm from  
I'ma sip until I feel it  
I'ma smoke until it's done  
I don't really give a fuck  
And my excuse is that I'm young  
And I'm only getting older  
Somebody shoula told ya  
I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
I said I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
A strong on  
2 white cups and I got that drink  
It could be purple it could be pink  
Depending on how you mix that shit  
Money to be gotten I'ma get that shit  
Cause I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
Ah yeah ah yeah  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
  
You know what I'm sippin  
I teach you how to mix it  
But you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't I don't trust these bitches  
They might catch me slipping  
So you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
They might they might catch me slipping  
And put in something different  
So you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't I don't trust these bitches  
They might catch me slipping  
So you're the only one  
  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho ohhh  
  
Drizzy drake check me out  
Coming live from the mu-fucking north side  
Kid game run game run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like it's somebody you don't know  
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show  
I can tell I can tell I can tell certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess they didn't really make 'em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still let them girls in  
And tell 'em all leave them cellphones on the table where we see 'em  
I'm all day wit' it man am to the pm  
Niggas hatin' I just wish that they would say it when we see 'em all  
  
That's that shit that drives me crazy  
And it's all that I've been getting lately  
And it's pro'ly why I'm scared to put the time in  
Women wanna fuck like that mean I'm them  
Looking for somethings and I think that I can find them  
In you in you  
  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho ohhh


Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff  
Are the only ones with enough  
To feel what I'm about to say in this song  
When they want you to be like somebody else  
And you just wanna be yourself  
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong  
It is when all the press articles happening  
And the cameras get to snappin  
And they try to make you out as a lie  
Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em'  
By using logic and reason  
It's a lose lose why even try  
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected  
And They never really know how to feel  
Phone calls is something that you're expecting  
For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill  
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first  
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around  
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself (yourselves)  
Instead of claimin' that you couldn't help and maybe next time you were
(ain't) In town  
  
Chorus:  
You gonna try to try harder cos  
Try harder cos  
  
Try -Try-Try-Try  
  
And the managers make you circum to pressure  
And you spitin' the pressure than most of the rappers running the game  
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past  
And turn the profit to cash  
There's time I would have done it the same  
I mean I got me a range  
Also got me a guilty conscience  
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran  
Sometimes I wish that I woulda' just chilled on the sneakers  
And watched the game from the bleachers  
Cos I'm really telling me what I spent  
In a house that I promised to get my mother  
Don't compensate for the other time  
I wasted late out at the club  
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner  
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love  
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets  
And just spending money on beats that  
She can rest without a toss and a turn  
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me  
And people watch me on tv  
That's exactly why I often get burned  
But I'm gonna try to.


Let me know, let me know  
Ooh, let me know, let me know let me know  
  
Uh, yeah this is really one of my dumbest flows ever  
I haven't slept in days  
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways  
So I'm single thinking about what we had and missing you  
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too  
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out  
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out  
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out  
And all the girls that played me eat your motherfucking heart out, its Drizzy  
Always gone but never hard to find  
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind  
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave  
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save  
But I'm good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle  
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now  
Never forgetting from where I came  
And no matter where I'm headed  
I promise to stay the same (yeah, look)  
  
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down  
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around  
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters  
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest  
  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I'm doin' my thing) 'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable  
  
This just might be my realest flow ever  
When I say fo' life, y'all say fo'ever (fo'ever)  
It's hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts  
The closest your gone get to this is a Pac T-shirt  
The names young, baby you know I live that thug life  
The good die young so I'm gone need a thug wife  
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms  
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm (yeah)  
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car  
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar  
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers  
Damn right, so fly I need feathers  
Sayin' shit in the streets so whats the dilly  
You done everything in the A but fuck Chilli (haha)  
So welcome to my life no two days the same  
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her names the game  
  
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down  
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around  
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters  
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest  
  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I'm doin' my thing) 'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable  
  
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night  
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life  
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife  
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife  
  
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil' bra  
Unforgettable, ya never forget this  
You understand me? Timeless homie, unforgettable (Let me know, let me know)


Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things  
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything  
I'm having a good time haters tryna ruin it,  
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doin' it  
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, Larry time  
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,  
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain't nothin' nice  
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life  
Okay now we outta here  
Toodles to you bitches  
And if you dolled up  
I got the voodoo for you bitches, yeah  
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble  
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double  
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of  
But I never ever trip  
Just peace happiness and love  
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug  
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does, ah!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm about whatever man  
Fuck what they be talkin' about,  
They opinion doesn't count,  
We the only thing that matters (ooh)  
So we do it how we do it  
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it  
I be up all night,  
Whole crews in here  
Cause I don't really know who I'm a lose this year (ow)  
Man I love my team.  
Man I love my team  
I would die for them niggas, ow  
  
Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her I'm a get her  
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter  
I got that kinda' wait wait fixate!  
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?  
That was just a keep sake  
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase  
Never been a cheapskate  
We got the Hawks I ain't talkin' about the peach state  
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweep stakes  
(ha ha ha ha)  
Fuck I look like hoe  
I look like yes and you like no  
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed.  
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed  
M M M6 from a M-2  
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu  
But I collect 100 thou at the venue  
And pop bottles with the team young money til the death of me  
  
I'm about whatever man.  
Fuck what they be talking about,  
They opinion doesn't count,  
We the only thing that matters (ow)  
So we do it how we do it  
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it  
I be up all night,  
Whole crews in here  
Cause I don't really know who I'm a lose this year (ow)  
Man I love my team  
Man I love my team  
I would die for them niggas, ow  
  
I mean we can't even rock them shoes if it ain't gotta comma on the price tag  
I mean, I mean but then again who who looks at the price tag  
  
Oh yeah we in this bitch  
Ow, ow, ow  
Oh yeah we in this bitch  
Ow, ow, ow  
  
[Chorus: x2]


[Verse 1]  
Been a minute since we've slept together  
Gotta get myself together  
I've been thinkin' about everything  
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely  
Lonely on a Wednesday night  
Girl I'm lonely  
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet  
Girl I'm lonely  
That shit ain't my fault girl  
Cause I'm lonely  
Name another woman, ain't no other woman who should come for me  
When I'm lonely  
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny  
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely  
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely  
  
[Verse 2]  
Heard you spend your summers in Miami  
At somebody's house  
That you didn't buy  
You're young so have fun girl  
I hope it's worth it  
Cause fuck it I'm not here to judge  
Fuck it I'm not here to love  
Everything you did to ball  
Fuck it, I'm just glad that you called  
Ring ring ring, what a thing  
Ring ring ring, school bell ring  
You and I got options there  
Name another woman  
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I'm lonely  
When I'm lonely  
Mix the Remy with a little bit of Henny  
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely  
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely  
This shit ain't my fault


[Drake]  
What if I kissed you right now  
How would we explain it  
Trying to imagine how it might sound  
If I just yelled out  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off our shoulders  
Take me I'm yours  
And I don't really care who knows it  
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com  
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else  
Not a problem [?]  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off of our shoulders  
Tell on me  
I don't mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie  
Admit that I'm yours  
I doon't really care who knows it  
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions  
  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else  
Not a problem [?]  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
What if I kissed you right now  
  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (all mine)  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
[End]a


[Verse 1: drake]  
I have to watch the road  
I swear that every car that passes has you in it  
I can't believe we're finished  
My life is movin' fast  
The time will often pass  
And something will remind me  
I can't put this behind me  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could've had my all by now, by now  
It's been too many years for you to disappear  
And have me asking the question  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 2: dawn richard]  
I swear I heard you call  
But when I heard you'd gone  
I hate that I looked desperate  
You gone is like me naked  
I'm staring at your (?)  
Trying to make it last  
Keep looking close behind me  
My eyesight on a memory  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could have all my love right now, by now  
Gave into my fears  
While you just disappeared  
That's why I'm asking this question...  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 3: drake]  
I can't go to bed  
Thinking about my goals  
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline  
Where did the other half of my heart go?  
Why am I in bed alone?  
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?  
Do you even live there?  
Or did you take a u-haul?  
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?  
We were on fire  
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out  
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you

10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man

Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep  
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peace  
  
[Verse 1]  
I can tell ya how it happened  
I can tell ya bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas  
I can tell you not a rapper  
Tryna sell these story I don't even open up the package  
Who you with? What you claim?  
I was paying momma's rent was I turning 17  
Sold it dirty like Diana never clean  
My ex ask me where I'm moving I said "On to better things"  
  
[Hook]  
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man

Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep

[Verse 2]  
I been in the crib with the phones off  
I been at the house taking no calls  
I done hit the stride got my shit going  
In the six cooking with the wrist motion  
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is  
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year  
I could never ever let the streets down  
Haven't left the condo in a week now  
  
[Hook]  
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man

Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep  
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peace  
  
[Verse 3]  
I been on a mission haven't left the condo  
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto  
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina  
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?  
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds  
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds  
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like blue DaVinci  
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City  
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came  
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'  
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace  
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise  
(Woo)  
They got me feeling like the one again  
(Woo)  
They got me feeling like the one again  
Yeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me  
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been  
  
[Hook]  
10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man  
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G  
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep  
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peace  
  
[Outro]  
I been in the crib with the phones off  
I been at the house taking no calls  
I done hit the stride got my shit going  
In the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri


Drop down, drop-drop

Locker room full of money, girl you just did it!

Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit

Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it, you did it  
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending

Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit

[Intro]  
Rrrr Ting  
  
[Verse]  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
Watch your motherfuckin' tone boy  
Get hurt boy  
Aww here go another mo'fucker that don't understand the concept of puttin'
money first boy (first)  
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)  
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)  
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know, ahh that's the worst boy
(worst)  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
You haven't been a man for like a minute  
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul  
You can really get the business  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes  
Got me feelin' like a ball hog  
I don't pass 'em when I get it  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
You too worried 'bout the bitches  
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it  
She'll admit it, she'll admit it  
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas  
And just like every single other thing in my life  
You can have her when I'm finished  
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit boy  
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6 boy  
Shit hot up in the 6 right now shit hot up in the 6 boy  
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now  
Come see us and get it fixed boy  
Black Benz on the road boy  
Already had a Rolls Royce  
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys  
I give a fuck about old boy  
I give a fuck about his squad boy  
I give a fuck about your mob boy  
I'm the real 6 God boy  
I'm about to say a true thing  
I'm about to say a true thing  
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain  
God damn you changed  
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting  
It's a OVO come through murk things  
I know you heard things  
Bitch I know you heard things  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
I'm not new to this  
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side  
I'm not new to this  
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side  
I'm not new to this  
I'm not new, I'm not new  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
Nobody really likes us except for us  
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up  
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now  
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now


[Intro]  
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know  
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city  
Shit's crazy right now, this shit ain't gonna stop  
You know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better  
  
[Verse 1]  
Look  
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good  
Better than her telling me the check's no good  
Now they wanna act like I do no good  
Funny cause I really did more than I should  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it  
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it  
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one  
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one  
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it  
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it  
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it  
Same way, breads gotta break for it  
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now  
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
  
[Hook]  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
  
[Verse 2]  
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand  
I'mma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"  
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend  
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again  
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it  
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it  
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things  
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away  
Six upside down, it's a nine now  
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now  
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
  
[Hook]  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
  
[Outro]  
Make me feel the same way that I did to you  
Trust me when I say I'll go without you  
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves  
God made himself a way from me to you  
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views  
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views  
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side  
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side  
I said I am....


Yeah uh yeah  
These are my one St Thomas flows  
Me and my n-ggas and some madonna hoes  
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go  
Discussin' life and all our common goals  
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll  
Look how the champagne diamonds flow  
Find dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low  
I'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'  
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'  
These other rappers gettin' at it very you feelin  
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'  
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'  
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant  
People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays  
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days  
Damn I guess it does what the message was  
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because  
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us  
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us  
Yeah, I know these n-ggas miss the mean lyrics  
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit  
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up  
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader  
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up  
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up  
Who you like, tell me who it is  
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list  
I should call it a night but f-ck it I can't resist  
This one is for all my n-ggas from my city tryin to diss  
Without a responce from me you really fail to exist  
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the sh-t  
I swear, aghh p-ssy n-gga get your bread up  
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up  
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up  
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup  
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up  
  
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better  
Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff  
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club  
Damn that n-gga always kept it so hood  
Back when we would smoke good  
At the oakwoods  
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch  
Now we just f-ckin all the b-tches they warned us about  
Scared for the first time everything has clicked  
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict  
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked  
To write a chapter in history this sh-t has got me sick  
Lyrics courtesy of www.Killerhiphop.com  
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split  
Cause this truly is some sh-t I don't expect you all to get  
I'm nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team
in  
Throwin up in a huddle n-gga Willie beamin  
Were still throwin touchdown passes  
And tore his frame glasses  
Hopin that someone catch it  
People say that oh drake we started to miss it  
But they need to be a little more specific man is this what yall want?  
And my best chris tucker impression  
Ducking your questions  
F-ck your suggestions  
Money gets all of my love and affection  
Cars all black like the cover of essence  
I'm allergic to comin in second  
But I never sneeze  
N-gga YMOE n-gga yeeah  
Uh, yeah, this want yall want  
Octobers Very Own  
Young Money  
ATF  
Thank me later in this b-tch wasssup  
Free Weezy in this b-tch wasup  
June 15th in this b-tch wasup


Diamoexplainnds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished  
No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business  
It is a shame that a couple of 'em are off limits  
No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small  
We all lust for the same women  
You know the ones we saw before we came in it  
I know he ain't trippin'  
I know I got a couple things that lil' wayne dipped in  
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it  
This shit is all about hits and misses  
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up  
Don't let them fuck your life up  
  
Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up  
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up  
Jim moore got me dressing like a leading man  
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand  
Young frank, suits cut right always  
Just got a couple warhol's for my hallways  
New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something  
Bitches on the kid like I'm iverson of something  
Like a sixer, since I sold 680 in my first  
Drizzy drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse  
Swag!


Spending every moment in the studio  
I'd never said it'd be fair  
But when you're all alone I hope you truly know  
How bad I want to be there  
  
[Chorus]  
Come right here  
Set your bag down  
I took a night off for you  
Go ahead and turn the lights off  
But keep your heels on  
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do  
  
No you ain't explainin' how you want it done  
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl  
Can you work without a second for some fun  
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl  
And I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
  
I been waitin for so long to get you all alone  
Now I finally got you right here  
So baby I'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone  
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear  
I want you on top  
So let ya hair down  
I took the night off for you  
Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off  
But keep ya heels on  
They're fittin' for what we're about to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No you ain't explainin how you want it done  
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl  
Can you work without a second for some fun  
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl  
And I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
  
Oh oh. It's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio


[Drake:]  
It's Southern Smoke Boy!  
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh  
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-are-A-K-K-E  
Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man  
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy  
  
[Verse 1: drake]  
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around  
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down  
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions  
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled  
In I take q's from my big boy popz  
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch  
They getting foul on the star  
But it's all eyes on me like I'm coppin some vows for the bar  
Get it guess not picture me not strive  
To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a  
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later  
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up  
I put a split in the middle then I seperater  
  
[Chorus: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ridin' low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
That's just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
That's it goes  
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough  
Cause it ain't all about that no more  
  
[Chorus: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game  
  
[Verse 3: trey songz]  
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be  
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free  
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury  
But without it all I'm still about the game  
  
[Bridge:]  
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)  
  
[Chorus x2: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game  
  
[Verse 4:]  
Ridin' low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
That's just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
That's it goes  
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough  
Cause it ain't all about that no more  
  
[Bridge:]  
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)  
  
[Chorus x2: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game


[NICKELUS F:]  
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings  
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings  
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning  
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live  
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?  
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams  
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth  
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life  
I realize how many [?]  
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth  
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church  
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP  
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS  
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH  
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT  
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped  
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot  
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch  
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock  
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering  
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT  
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked  
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh  
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh  
[?]  
  
[CHORUS:]  
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit  
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits  
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows  
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos  
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
[DRAKE:]  
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in  
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving  
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins  
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in  
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'  
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane [?]  
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win  
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me  
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll  
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal  
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map  
[?] Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap  
[?] Pass the torch and sell they soul [?]  
Maybe they can bring they career back  
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that  
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's  
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive  
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check  
My cousins, they paint they [?] to get respect  
This can't be life, dominoes and [?] dro and twenty stacks  
[?]  
[?]  
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!  
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny  
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at!  
  
[CHORUS:]  
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit  
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits  
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows  
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos  
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM


[Verse:]  
All right!  
She'll be jumping up and down,  
Trying to fit that ass in.  
Took her half an hour just to get that...  
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion,  
I don't know where she's going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Cause her spirit is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key  
Homie that's a guarantee  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,  
Kinda' hard to concentrate when cameras are flashing.  
Other dudes will suffocate her, I don't want her gaspin,  
Don't know where she's going, and I do not plan on asking at all  
I've never been the type felt a like my connection  
With niggas that wanna fight over women, that's not right,  
There's too many in the world, homie you could have yo pick  
But I swear that one's my girl, I swear that one's my girl


[Intro]  
Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again  
  
[Verse]  
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley  
You can never check me  
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message  
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon  
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97  
Whoa, very important and very pretentious  
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention  
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience  
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options  
I wanna see my niggas go insane  
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame  
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne  
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way  
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?  
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB  
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad  
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap  
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up  
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs  
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough  
They just mad cause I got the midas touch  
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her  
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?  
I know that you gotta be a thug for her  
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more  
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers  
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga  
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas  
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas  
Make sure you hit him with the prenup  
Then tell that man to ease up  
I did another one, I did another one  
You still ain't did shit about the other one  
I got the drink in me goin' back to back  
Yeah, goin' back to back  
I got the drink in me goin' back to back  
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back  
I don't wanna hear about this ever again  
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends  
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"  
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event  
Oh, you need better seatin'  
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason  
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em  
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom  
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece  
Please, please do not let these niggas near me  
Please, think before you come for the great one  
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?  
Please, somebody stop me  
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy  
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit  
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'  
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back  
Yeah, they want it back to back  
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back  
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga


[Hook:]  
I'm black and Jewish  
Don't be so foolish  
I'm black and Jewish  
It's a Mitzvah  
  
[Verse]  
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish  
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is  
Chillin' in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz  
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz  
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air  
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer  
  
[Interlude]  
Like Baruch [?] Yisrael  
[?] Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen  
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches  
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy  
Do not go to Feingold's, though  
The pickles are rubber  
And I will not be harmin' yah  
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it  
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah  
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada  
Daddy from Africa  
Both of best worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya'  
Challah!


Yeah, isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack
communication  
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing  
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different" oh  
Oh the idea's fun  
Oh the idea's fun  
Oh the idea is so fun every time  
At least we try for home run every time  
  
Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'  
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me  
Same city, same friends if you're looking  
I'll be here just swangin'  
Don't talk to me like I'm famous  
And don't assume 'cause I don't expect assumptions babe  
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe, yeah swangin' eh  
  
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely
remember  
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power  
Yea she just wanna run over my feelings  
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler and I'd allow her,  
Talk about pussy power  
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"  
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself  
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down  
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground  
'Cause you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way
around  
  
Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'  
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me  
Same city, same friends if you're looking  
I'll be here just swangin' eh  
Don't talk to me like I'm famous eh  
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe  
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe I'll be here just swangin'  
  
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is  
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up  
I take Eglinton to 401 east and  
Exit at Markham road in the east end  
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping  
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend  
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends  
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness  
I hate stoppin' for gas this late 'cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how
we're creepin'  
Summer is comin' know you could feel it  
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it  
Won't knock on your door  
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"  
I got the pedal to the floor  
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'  
  
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there  
I'll be there just swangin'  
I'll be there just swangin'  
I treat you good girl like you're famous  
I know I'm late it's always the same shit  
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there  
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl


[Chorus:]  
Somebody remind me where I am  
That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it...  
  
[Drake - Verse 1]  
Tonight I'm into breaking up  
Somebody's home  
I'm drunk as ever  
I'm not alone, I'm with my people  
I know you love it  
I don't jus do it  
I over does it  
I be getting money so long  
It's just paper to me  
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me  
You can never reminisce when you forget it all  
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all  
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio  
Baby forget about it  
I'm headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed  
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it  
My judgements never clouded  
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman  
I'm bout whatever man  
I'm tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland  
But I'm polite about it  
Baby after you  
I've had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
-that's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light  
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night  
Where'd I put my bow tie  
Millionnaire multi  
Rest in peace to B. I. G and praises to the most high  
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions  
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given  
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition  
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of livin'  
I live from it though, I've been down and I got up  
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up  
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen  
Because everythings easier to get into than get out of  
But someone show me to the owner of this city  
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me  
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee  
Ny forever nigga, Diddy,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somebody remind me where I am  
That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it


Uh yea alright  
Uh well alright  
Yea well alright

Gasps

[Verse 1:]  
It's a celebration clap clap bravo lobster and shrimp  
And a glass of miskato for the girl whose  
A student and her friends whose a model  
Finished the whole bottle... And we gonna do it big like this  
Yea and he was just practice he ain't  
In your world you can take him off ya atlas  
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with  
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this outtt  
Show me where ya tax is show me where ya hands at  
Maybe I can grasp it they say if ya get her  
You can understand her better  
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her  
Yea... And I got it together so when they  
Talk they try to turn me it's like whatever  
... Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself  
  
Yea uh  
Uh look

[Verse 2:]  
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage her  
Especially when you think nobody is understanding ya  
These girls groups with they overprotected managers  
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a  
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space  
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface  
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate  
? Girl it's graces on top is such a hard place?  
Yea... But if you never even been there  
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin  
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures of ya swimwear  
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air  
I know that shit is exhausting girl  
And your mistakes are costing girl  
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself


[Talking:]  
I do this for ya'll man  
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the remix!  
  
[Verse 1: Malice]  
  
[Background:]  
Are-E you-P G-A-N-G  
Are-E you-P G-A-N-G  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it  
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it  
So now you at the store for some blank cds  
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it  
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you  
And I'll be the only one she concerned with  
To the people that ignored me before this  
This one is for you as a song re-recorded  
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along  
Your vision's just been distorted  
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business  
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh  
The waiting is over I think music need it  
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded  
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude  
They expectations Imma exceed it uh  
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it  
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish  
Finally here Imma star with the timing  
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining  
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]  
You only get the dough when you grindin  
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne  
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 3: Nickelus F]  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do


When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world  
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl  
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting  
And it's all because she don't want things to change  
  
[Chorus]  
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho)  
  
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together  
But we sure make it feel like we're together  
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho)


Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
  
[Drake - Verse 1]  
I got car money, fresh start money  
I want Saudi money, I want art money  
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me  
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me  
Yeh, and lately I do bitches the meanest  
Tell em I love em and don't ever mean it  
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods, they never seen it  
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient  
I aint lying, yeah  
And comfortable I sit  
That manual Ferrari Italian, some fly shit  
It's sittin' at the house like I bought it in '9-6  
Cause honestly I'm too f-cking busy to drive stick  
I swear, too f-cking busy, too busy f-cking  
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't  
Been hot before they open doors for me  
Preheated oven, I'm in this so  
But I aint finished though  
It's been a minute though  
My newest girl back home, got issues with parents  
And some charges, how the f-ck can I get her to Paris  
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen  
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance  
Dreams money can buy  
Everybody yelled surprised I wasn't surprised  
That's only cause I been waitin' on it, nigga  
So f-ck whoever hatin on a nigga  
Of course  
  
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't...  
  
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia's  
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya  
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it  
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it  
Ymcmb these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of it's
envy  
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty  
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi  
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive  
Shit I seen it, you just aint inside  
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5  
My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive  
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna  
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer  
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass  
Then I'll probably give her my number  
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high  
And they land on the stage, dance on  
We got company coming over  
Would it kill you to put some pants on  
Dreams money can buy  
They told me it's like a high, it wasn't a lie  
Yeah, just have some good p-ssy waiting on a nigga  
And f-ck whoever hatin' on a nigga  
  
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't...


[Intro]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Hook]  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
[Verse 1]  
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'  
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'  
Look like you hidin' your problems  
Really you never was all in  
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me  
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three  
Like one, three, yeah  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
That's when they smile in my face  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place  
I can tell that love is fake  
I don't trust a word you say  
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?  
Look you in the face and it's just not the same  
  
[Hook]  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
  
[Verse 2]  
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe  
Vibe switch like night and day, I can see it like right away  
I came up, you changed up, I caught that whole play  
Since then, things never been the same  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
That's when they smile in my face  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place  
I can tell that love is fake  
(I can tell that love is fake)  
I don't trust a word you say  
(I don't trust a word...)  
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?  
(That's just what I heard)  
Look you in the face and it's just not the same  
  
[Hook]  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me  
I got fake people showin' fake love to me  
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face  
  
[Outro]  
Skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)


This is why I do this shit.  
I think they call this, uh, venting.  
  
Yea  
Look  
Uh  
  
This is me.  
Still the same.  
They want the hits.  
I play the game.  
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.  
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.  
What up lil' braw.  
What up slumville.  
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still.  
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.  
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.  
That ain't how it works.  
That ain't that how it goes.  
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.  
And I could use a writer to balance my flows.  
But I never share my thoughts,  
This is all a nigga knows.  
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.  
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized.  
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.  
So every word I utter will be mine.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
  
Don't take this the wrong way but  
I never cried when Pac died.  
But I probably will when Hov does.  
And if my tears hold value,  
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.  
And I'll be standing in a puddle.  
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.  
And Ima keep it honest.  
Am so tired of being subtle.  
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle.  
Staring at the members of my team.  
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.  
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.  
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.  
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.  
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.  
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.  
At least I put it all in the open.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh uh.  
  
Look.  
Fuck all y'all.  
We ignore feelings here.  
Premature millionaires.  
Welcome to my realest year.  
Yeah.  
I swear we making a killer here.  
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here.  
Uh.  
But it's funny having fans.  
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,  
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.  
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.  
Yeah.  
And plus things are just so real at home  
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown  
And now security follow me everywhere  
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.  
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.  
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.  
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.  
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.  
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.  
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.  
I guess that mean they come few and far between.  
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.  
Yeah.  
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.  
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.  
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.  
It's funny how money can change everything.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh uh.


[Verse]  
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you  
You got something that belongs to me  
Your body language says it all  
Despite the things you said to me  
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?  
Changing your opinion on me  
I was only gone for the last few months  
But you don't have the time to wait on me  
  
[Hook]  
I try with you  
There's more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you  
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose  
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose  
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah  
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it  
World's, world's, world's famous  
World's, world's, world's famous  
  
[Post-Hook]  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listening to things you say  
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
Maybe we just should have did things my way  
Instead of the other way  
  
[Hook]  
I tried with you  
There's more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you  
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose  
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose  
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah  
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it  
World's, world's, world's famous  
World's, world's, world's famous  
  
[Post-Hook]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listening to things you say  
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way  
I've stopped listening to things you say


I'm more than just an option  
(hey, hey, hey)  
Refuse to be forgotten  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I took a chance with my heart  
(hey, hey, hey)  
And I feel it taking over  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
I'm more than just a number  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I doubt you'll find another  
(hey, hey, hey)  
So every single summer  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I'll be the one that you remember  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
It's more than just a mission  
(hey, hey, hey)  
You hear but you don't listen  
(hey, hey, hey)  
You better pay attention  
(hey, hey, hey)  
And get what you been missing  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
Too many times I've been wrong  
I guess being right takes too long  
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do  
But give all I have to you and  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart.


Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go  
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow  
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below  
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago  
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit  
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with  
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it  
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with  
I hope that my success never alters our relationship  
Yeah, this life is something I would die for  
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th  
I just wish they'd let you try it first  
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me  
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery  
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me  
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though  
You never see it coming you just get to see it go  
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first  
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks!  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first  
That's why I'm really going off, Fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh


Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
  
[Verse:]  
Tell a bad bitch girl, lets go hang  
You know me, rolex, gold chain  
Fuck my young niggas, xo gang  
Get so drunk you forget yo name  
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit  
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change  
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes  
I miss this and I want it back, So I'm all in with these new flows  
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great  
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like grape tapes, now  
Lemme go an hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road  
These days keep going by too fast, so give anything that make shit go slow  
Yea, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous  
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us  
  
[Hook:]  
Tat my name on you so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it  
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit  
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine  
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea  
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours  
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune  
I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche  
It's simple love, simple math  
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle on her ass  
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle  
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working  
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's  
Mba accountants, amounts they get unholy  
But mama still praying for her rubberband man  
  
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'  
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Tat my name on you so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it  
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit  
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine

Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more  
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure  
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors  
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours  
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done  
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come  
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot  
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got  
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough  
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us  
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect  
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left  
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone  
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong  
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these
niggas know it's real, wassup  
  
[Hook:]  
Tat my name on you so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it  
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit  
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine  
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea  
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours  
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

[Verse 1:]  
Uh, Focus on women then you get less done  
It's light work, the flow is heavy like a wet sponge  
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think bein broke is less fun  
Celebratin' Father's Day everyday, so don't get sonned  
Where you tryin' to go? I'm ready  
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady  
I'm chillin' out with T, and Jay and Nico  
My city ain't a city that support they own people  
But I run it, you say something' about it? I doubt it  
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it  
I'm bout it, I'm bout it, I'm standin' on these couches  
Sayin' "bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch! "  
Pardon me that was rude  
If you just started ballin' I say I'm bout to conclude  
What more is there to do? And why would I pretend?  
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND'... Damn.

[Verse 2:]  
Yeah, Look  
Me and 40 wildin', stylin', somewhere on a island  
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in  
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'  
And I'm callin' yo bluff, don't act like you don't me dialin'  
Never embellish, believe him 'cause he exist  
There's stars on my team but I lead the league in assists  
Never been a believer that previously exists  
I wonder what I'd be doin' when previously is this  
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go  
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han  
Don't I treat you better than your ooo-old man  
He couldn't of done it like this sho' 'nuff  
I tend to dro' puff, I'm throwed and I'm high  
I guess I'm thrower up  
Tone it all down, my nigga grow up  
And tell me when you start gettin' paid to show up... Damn.

Look  
I know girls love Beyonc??  
Girls love to fuck with your conscience  
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you ain't no different  
These days it's hard to meet women  
Feel like my love life is finished  
I've been avoiding commitment  
That's why I'm in this position  
I'm scared to let somebody in on this  
No new friends, no no no  
You know how this shit go  
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone  
You try to act like it's just me, but I'm not alone  
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name  
  
[Chorus]  
Say my name, say my name  
When no one is around you  
Say, 'Baby, I love you'  
If you ain't running games  
Say my name, say my name  
You actin' kinda shady, baby  
Why the sudden change?  
Say my name  
Say my name  
Say my name  
Say my name, say my name  
If no one is around you  
  
Yeah  
Uh  
Say my name, say my name  
'Cause those other men are practice  
And this ain't no time for actin'  
And this ain't no time for games  
And this ain't no time for uncertainty  
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home  
and startin' some shit when I'm in the zone  
This is why I've been saying  
No new friends, no no no  
You know how this shit goes  
This is not four years ago  
Time escapes me  
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow  
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home  
All my young boys 'round me saying, 'Get money and fuck these hoes'  
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you  
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening  
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself  
I need someone I leave through the front door with  
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more  
'Cause you're not shy no more  
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more  
No, I'm not alone  
Even though nothing was the same  
Let me get your ass alone  
Let me make you say my name  
Say my name  
  
[Chorus]


[Verse]  
You've been home for three whole days  
Actin' like you got chores to do  
Boy this house is way too clean  
I don't think there's nothing more to do  
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong  
You was still you before she ever came along  
Get over it, get over it  
I mean I understand the pain  
Someone did me the same  
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it  
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight  
Go out tonight  
Order you a drink, don't even overthink  
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with  
And go out tonight, go out tonight  
Cause you might just meet me  
  
[Hook] (x2)  
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for  
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with  
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for  
Yeah, you might just meet me


[Verse 1]  
I am not a human, shout to all my moon men  
Yeah they call me Tune, got them bitches tuned in  
It's a crazy world, so I stay in mine  
And niggas don't cross the line, niggas stay in line  
Like welfare, I stay elsewhere  
Hotter than a devil? Nigga, hell yeah  
Rock-a-bye baby, homicide baby  
That's more tear drops, call me cry baby  
What you talking bout? Tell it to my 9  
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms  
I'm a young God, swagger unflawed  
Bitch, I'm in the building, you in the front yard  
Life's a bitch, naw, better yet a dumb broad  
And I bet I can fuck the world and make it cum hard  
Yeah, you boys is washed up  
And I'm shitting on em like two girls and one cup  
Weezy Baby aka Bring The Money Home  
Pull out the AK and pop you in your funny bone  
Laugh now, die later muthafucka  
You's a bitch like Zeta Phi Beta muthafucka  
  
[Hook]  
Yeah, I call it how I see you  
I wish I never met you, I wouldn't wanna be you  
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea  
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea  
  
[Verse 2]  
Man I'm so tired of balling, I sleep a lot now  
I'll let my goons rush you like Moscow  
Gun at your eyebrow, pow pow  
Man I ball hard even with five fouls  
Yeah, we in this bitch like tampons  
Dump you in the woods, now get your camp on  
Chokehold around this shit cause I'm so hands-on  
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on  
Back against the wall, my two feet is what I stand on  
Diva in the room, she blowing me just like a band horn  
Got her on her knees, the same knees that she be praying on  
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, "You can join"  
Yeah, what y'all wanna do? I'm all ears  
Smoking on that headband, call that shit Paul Pierce  
I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years  
Balled like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3, Drake]  
I am spending much more than I'm making  
On these cars and these vacations, is that too much information?  
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing  
With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station  
I am trying to figure out why you so mad at me  
Yes, I'm with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me  
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head  
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery  
(Okay) Nigga peep the shit I'm wyling on  
I be with your baby mama, you be with your child at home  
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam  
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone  
(Okay) I will break your fucking collar bone  
Us against the world, better pick which fucking side you on  
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on  
And we about to kill em, C4, Mr. Carter's home  
  
[Outro]  
Yeah, I call it how I see you

We some asshole niggas, call us diarrhea  
The money keep growing, yep, it's growing like a Chia  
Yeah, I call it how I see it  
Y'all some pussy ass niggas, we should call you gonorrhea  
You keep talking that shit, I'ma see you

[Intro:]  
Oh yeah, oh yeaah

[Drake - Verse 1]  
Summer's mine  
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'mma need it back  
I wish that you would come and find me  
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you  
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl  
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now  
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl  
Should be tired of taking care of me right now  
  
[Hook:]  
But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
So you should go  
You should go, before you stay too long  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged  
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste  
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait  
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish  
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the
girls get down  
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town  
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around  
She knows, she knows, she knows  
  
[Hook:]

Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah

Right, look, look

Tell me how you really feel, tell me how you really feel  
I would ask you what's the deal but y'all don't even got a deal  
Most niggas with a deal couldn't make a greatest hits  
Y'all a whole lot of things but you still ain't this  
I don't know no one that could tell me what to do  
Heard you never claimed the hood, heard the hood claimed you  
That can't sit well, oh well, ship sailed  
Still mine, all mine, cosign, cosign  
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines  
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah, just like the old times  
Same niggas from the old days, lot of sides on the same side  
OVO we a gold mine but I'm goin' gold in no time  
Doing plat, plat only, boys better back off me  
Hall of fame, hall of fame, like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off  
Like I'm shirt off shorty, whole city goin' crazy  
Whole city goin' crazy, top 5 no debating  
Top 5, top 5, top 5 and the whole city rate me  
And I'm back inside a matrix and I said that we would make it  
Aim squad with some traitors, knew my niggas from the basement  
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit, we done really put some days in

Get pissed off, start airin' it  
Get a head start, ain't friendly

When I say that I meant that  
I don't want to talk to you has-beens  
I don't want features from nan them  
I don't want features or nothin'  
You can't even get on my guest list  
They want me to go to the Met Gala  
I want a Percocet and a gallon  
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter  
We sittin' right on the courtside  
I know the players on both side  
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign  
I wear the chain like a bowtie  
I wear the ring like a fo'-five  
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys  
Black tints, low profile

Countin' up every single day  
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

You used to call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love,  
Call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing,  
I know when that hotline bling,  
That can only mean one thing  
  
[Verse 1]  
Ever since I left the city you,  
Got a reputation for yourself now  
Everybody knows and I feel left out,  
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out,  
Cause ever since I left the city, you,  
Started wearing less and goin' out more,  
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor  
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before,  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone,

[Verse 2]  
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you  
You and me we just don't get along,  
You make me feel like I did you wrong,  
Going places where you don't belong,  
Ever since I left the city, you,  
You got exactly what you asked for,  
Running out of pages in your passport,  
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love,  
Call me on my cell phone,

That can only mean one thing,  
I know when that hotline bling,  
That can only mean one thing  
  
[Verse 3]  
These days, all I do is  
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else,  
Wonder if you're rolling up a backwoods for someone else,  
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else  
You don't need no one else,  
You don't need nobody else, no,  
Why you never alone,  
Why you always touching road.  
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl.  
You was in the zone, yeah.  
You should just be yourself.  
Right now, you're someone else  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone

Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling

[Outro]  
Ever since I left the city...


That's what I'm talking about though, like you changed up  
You don't even fucking link nobody no more, you just dashing away like a Taxi  
Yo, you cheesed me dog  
  
[Verse:]  
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture  
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you  
Crazy how even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get ya  
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas  
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?  
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you  
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you  
  
[Hook:]  
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?  
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?  
What about now girl? How bout now?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Always been daddy's little angel  
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you  
I had no money, left from back when I was focused on the music  
I used to always try and burn you cds of my new shit  
You be like "who's this?"  
I be like "me, girl."  
You be like "oh word, true shit?"  
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris  
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it  
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that  
Like I was average like that  
Started drinking way more than I used to  
People form habits like that, girl  
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year  
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year, guess  
I just had to pretend that year  
I ain't even see my friends that year  
Places that I should've been  
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but  
  
[Hook:]  
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?  
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?  
What about now girl? How bout now?

Last year I know you learned your lesson

Boss up, I'm the bigger homie  
But I'm one year older than my lil homie  
'09 they was biddin' on me  
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me  
Ok now we got some action  
Everything I said, it happened

But off verses, he been blackin'  
Chasin' women a distraction  
They wan' be on TV right next to me  
You cannot be here right next to me  
Don't you see Riri right next to me?  
I hate a rapper especially  
They feel the same, but they hide it  
They just discuss it in private  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point in even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta die out eventually  
I cannot give you the recipe  
You know the game is sold separately  
Swear I just had an epiphany  
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's  
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie  
They used to always come check for me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
I don't take this shit for granted  
I do my own propaganda  
I feel like Juelz Santana  
Leg hangin' out the Phantom  
6 cold like Alaska  
Views already a classic  
Roy outta here like NASA  
Bustin' 1's out the plastic  
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her  
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious  
I feed my family with this  
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious  
I don't run out of material  
You shouldn't speak on me, period  
You try to give 'em your side of the story  
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it  
They feeling a way and won't hide it  
Niggas done being silent  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point of even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta go, they gotta go  
They gonna die out eventually  
I cannot give 'em no empathy  
I'ma have B's when I'm 70  
They cannot fuck with the legacy  
I don't know what else is left for me  
After this no one a threat to me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just done in the hype  
Me, I'm just done in the hype  
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done


[Chorus]  
Emotions in this game run deep  
So before these haters kill me in my sleep  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Reppin' 'til my last second through  
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Honored to be somebody they mention  
But before these niggas stop payin' attention  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure  
You'll never be somebody they need  
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed  
So tonight we gon' do it like this  
Oh, for the H-Town  
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go  
For the H-Town  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
You're now listenin' to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)  
Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)  
Pay attention, it's the beginnin' of a new era (era)  
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)  
It's like Lasik but are basic  
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it  
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it  
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted  
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it  
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it  
Been so many places, up and down the interstate  
Cities that I've never been, wonderin' if they fin' to hate  
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)  
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill (I keep it trill)  
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip  
So it's all good (good) don't even trip  
Believe me it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I've been all over the world  
Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)  
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)  
What we got into, what we gettin' into (to)  
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu ('su)  
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)  
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar)  
From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans)  
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)  
Me and my "II Trill" team on the road flippin' (flippin')  
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')  
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')  
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')  
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)  
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)  
But we always made it home okay  
And we still on the road to this day  
I gotta say it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say that you never really know  
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)  
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)  
If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)  
But looks can be deceivin', so don't you get it twisted (twisted)  
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)  
Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days)  
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place  
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)  
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)  
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin'
through)  
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child)  
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)  
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)  
And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy)  
So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me  
For those that overstood me, understand me  
It's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure


[Drake]  
Uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks  
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart  
Like clap clap, let em fall slow  
I know you had you fears you can let them all go  
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly  
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me  
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be  
I provide protection if you open up the door for me  
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates  
Couple 'i think that we're ready's'  
Couple 'i think we should wait's'  
Are we acting like a couple, I'm just trying to get it straight  
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes  
  
[Jhene Aiko - Chorus]  
You had to change up the game  
Oh the weather is not the same  
Now there's only cloudy days  
I can't stand the rain in July  
Oh July  
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)  
But now it's getting colder  
The leafs are turning colours  
Why, it's just not our season  
The one and only reason  
Baby oh baby oh  
When summer turn into fall  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go  
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had to know  
Had you over every night, every night was passionate  
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident  
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong  
I wish shorty I would be with you so long  
I was planning on being something worth mentioning  
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in  
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing  
Meanwhile we argue and I can't get a sentence in  
And just as I predicted here we go again  
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jhene Aiko]  
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end but then the season
changed  
[Drake]  
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your girl)  
Shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World  
Shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby  
[Jhene Aiko]  
Can't wait for, can't wait for, can't wait for springtime  
And I will turn into a butterfly  
I will spread my wings and fly  
And I'm too fly for the sh-t  
Ohhh, I am Japanese if you please


[Hook]  
When I pull up on a nigga  
Tell that nigga back back  
I'm too good with these words  
Watch a nigga backtrack  
If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend  
It's too late for my city  
I'm the youngest nigga reppin  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm on first, I'm on tour  
Got a girl, she from the South  
Used to work, used to dance in Texas  
Now she clean the house  
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about  
On my way, money taught me Spanish  
Make it andale  
Way up north, packed in Honda cars  
They 'ont know who we are  
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shootin at the star  
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs  
They can't live this long  
You don't know where you're gonna go  
I got this shit mapped out strong  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
  
[Hook]  
When I pull up on a nigga  
Tell that nigga back back  
I'm too good with these words  
Watch a nigga backtrack  
If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend  
It's too late for my city  
I'm the youngest nigga reppin  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm the one, one  
Why do I feel like the only one?  
Why do I feel like you owe me one?  
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one  
Yeaaah, you know wassup  
They been off for a minute now  
You know they all sentimental now  
You know they all actin' different now  
And I, I just can't pretend  
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in  
I can't change, this shit set in stone  
They can't live this long  
You don't know where you're gonna go  
I got this shit mapped out strong  
  
[Hook]  
When I pull up on a nigga  
Tell that nigga back back  
I'm too good with these words  
Watch a nigga backtrack  
If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend  
It's too late for my city  
I'm the youngest nigga reppin  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend


[Verse 1:]  
Uh, when did you get like this  
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning  
I don't regret like this  
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning  
Saying, this just ain't my style  
You can't say you're happy either  
You don't even smile, for me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you agree, we should let it be  
And did you agree, it's a must,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you decided to knock on my door  
Did you remember what happened before  
The look on your face said you were expecting more  
But some things look better inside of the store  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you agree, we should let it be  
And did you agree, it's a must,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Leave me, leave me, I can't fkn stand you  
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to  
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend  
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end  
But, ion really feel that  
I just really wanna turn the wheels back  
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back  
Convince you that time will heal that  
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue  
I swear everytime I call  
You jus tell me how I don't call you  
Why you do that... Do that... Do that  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you agree, we should let it be  
And did you agree, it's a must,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us


Verse:  
(Drake)  
  
I'm Tryin To Do It All Tonight, I Got Plans  
I Got A Certain Lust For Life, And As It Stands  
Everything Is Goin' As Right, As It Can  
They Tryna Shoot Down My Flight,  
Before It Lands... Before It Lands  
  
But You Can Miss Me With All That,  
Diss Me Then Crawl Back,  
I Really Wish Ya'll Would Fall Back,  
But Gettin' Rich Suppose To Solve That,  
And These Days Women Make Offers,  
And Who The Hell Am I To Say (No, No, No),  
My Ex Send Late Night Text,  
Cause She Don't Know How To Let (Go, Go, Go),  
She In Love,  
And As For Them Pretty Light Skinned Models Standin' In The Cold,  
Aw Yah They With Us,  
Let Them Girls In For A Drink,  
And I'm All, In They Ear,  
Saying She Should Be The One I See,  
Everytime, That I'm Here,  
But When Am I Really Even Here,  
Black Surburban With The Tint On It,  
Fresher Than A Pillow With A Mint On It,  
The Game Got These Old Hand Prints On It,  
But Imma Be The One To Pour Cement On It,  
Uh, And Start Over,  
And Show Up In A Mars Yellow Tux,  
I Don't Really Give A fuck And We Only Gettin' Older,  
So What I Tend To Do, Is To Think Of Today As The Past,  
It's Funny When You're Coming In First,  
But You Hope That You Last (You Just Hope That It Lasts)  
  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air For Her  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air  
Throw Your One's Up


[Hook]  
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl  
Oh man I don't know  
Pilled up filled up damn girl  
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man  
Laced up dripped up sauced up  
Damn girl I wanna ride with you  
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up  
Had to get it popping with you  
  
[Verse 1]  
What if I pick you up from your house  
We should get out  
We haven't talked in a while  
We should roll to see where it goes  
I saw potential in you from the go  
You know that I did  
I don't know if you know but I know who you are  
You could be big as Madonna  
Just get in the car and let's touch the road  
Don't make other plans  
Say you get up early, you work for the man  
Well he'll understand  
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten  
Already on ten  
Big as Madonna I'll say it again  
Soon as you get in nah nah nah  
  
[Hook]  
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl  
Oh man I don't know  
Pilled up filled up damn girl  
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man  
Laced up dripped up sauced up  
Damn girl I wanna ride with you  
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up  
Had to get it popping with you


Hello, yeah I just walked in, yeah I'm good you still working?  
Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple
of clubs  
I never went to bed, shit' wine or water  
You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night'  
  
Cups of the Rose  
Bitches in my old phone  
I should call one and go home  
I've been in this club too long  
The woman that I would try  
Is happy wit a good guy  
But I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call her anyway and say  
  
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had  
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found  
And since you picked up I know he's not around  
  
(Are you drunk right now?)  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately?  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
Uh, cups of the XO  
All my people been here  
I see all of her friends here  
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more  
Flights in the morning  
What you doing that's so important?  
I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call you anyway and say  
  
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had  
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found  
And since you picked up I know he's not around oh  
(Are you drunk right now?)  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures  
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches  
That we almost had  
I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters  
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad  
But shit it's all good  
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party  
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party  
I was just calling cause they were just leaving  
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in  
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?  
Too many drinks have been given to me  
I got some women that's living off me  
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed  
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names  
After a while girl they all seem the same  
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain  
Having a hard time adjusting to fame  
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl  
I'm lucky that you picked up  
Lucky that you stayed on  
I need someone to put this weight on  
  
"Well I'm sorry"  
"Are you drunk right now?"  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
"You're not going to come?"  
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then"  
  
Just throw up while I hold your hair back  
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"  
I hope no-one heard that  
I hope no-one heard that  
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble


I am on that 24 hour  
Champagne diet spillin while I'm sippin  
I encourage you to try it  
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it  
The club owner supply it  
Boy I'm on that fly shit  
I am, what everybody in my past don't want me to be  
Guess what, I made it  
I'm the mother fucking man  
I just want you to see  
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga  
Quit fronting on me  
Don't come around and try to gas me up I like runnin on E  
I I I I'm on my disneyg shit  
Goofy flow on records I'm Captin Hook  
And my new car is Rupio  
Damn where my roof just go  
I'm somebody that you should know  
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drama produced it fo'  
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for  
Leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes  
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go  
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl  
  
I got 'em  
He can't, they can't, and I can't blame 'em  
Since I got famous bitch, I got money to blow  
Gettin it in, letting these bills fall  
All over your skin  
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh oh oh


I love you so much!  
But I hate what you've done  
I know from here things will never be the same  
And things will probably never change  
I know what we want  
Isn't exactly what god had planned  
Hey it's all I can do is  
Hope you can see the difference  
And prey for the best  
Please don't forget me!  
  
I wont soothe your pain  
I wont ease your strength  
  
Drake:  
I should let you fall in love with  
Someone else girl  
I live in L. A  
You in Chicago  
You're not patient  
I'm not patient  
We shouldn't be together  
I think we shouldn't be together  
No more no (no more no)  
Just think I'm where it all beginning  
You're the envy of your prince  
Plus you know you're not yourself any more  
The miracle of change  
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl  
And I'm sorry  
I said I'm sorry girl  
(Yeah)  
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it  
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying  
  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
Try to control us  
You wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us  
  
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy  
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments  
I mean women inspire me to great things  
(Drake:?)  
I need to grow some fucking confidence  
And why you gotta say the last words  
And if I tell you how I really felt  
(There probably end up being another argument candy girl,  
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)  
Yeah  
And that shit starts to get old  
And I don't mean to say the most  
But you know how they say you are who you hang with?  
So it bothers me when you hang with hoes  
  
Drake:  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
  
You know how they say  
If you love somebody  
That don't love you back  
Love them anyway


We both wake up, staring at the sky  
Don't remember how we got here but we don't wonder why  
Right now we living life like there's no way we can die  
But we bout to do our thing they couldn't stop us if they try  
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high  
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each other's side  
We were meant to be together we get inside  
How the hell would they kill us when we're feeling so alive  
  
Ooh girl I know you want a G  
It's kinda hard not to notice me  
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be  
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
Baby I can give what you want and everything you need  
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed  
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed  
All the blessings that I get I promise you'll receive  
Fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive  
Let me take away your pain, my job is to relieve  
  
Ooh girl I know you want a G  
It's kinda hard not to notice me  
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be  
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
One time for the homie dj screw  
Already I'm feelin' throwed in this bitch  
  
I'm so high even when I'm comin' down  
Just met a girl, said she from the H-Town  
I said my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer  
A cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah  
Got these boppers goin' crazy  
  
Nigga, I'm the man, I sent your girl message  
Said I see you when I can  
She send me one back but I ain't never read it  
'Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it and  
  
I'm tellin' you when homies runnin' down in the winter  
And I be riding rims with tires in it thinner  
Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian  
And the water for the D's  
  
Don't know why it happens every time we alone  
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone  
So I'ma sip this drink till that motherfucker gone  
Than you go get undressed and we gon' get it on  
  
I don't give you the time you deserve from me  
This is something I know, I know, I know  
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston  
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow but I do it to her  
  
Draped up and dripped out know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Three in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot  
It's on once again and I never pretend  
A nigga stay G till the end, yeah  
  
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation  
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint  
Switching colors in the light, it's about like 11 P. M.  
And you just roaming through the city bumpin' that screw  
  
Big Mo, ugk, Lil Keke  
It feel like everything just moving slow  
Let's take my time, I pace it, baby  
Yeah, I'm gone


[Intro: Kyla]  
Baby I like your style  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now  
We only got a little while  
Just thinkin' out loud  
Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Outro: Justin Bieber]  
Hold on me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
One more dance is all I need  
One more dance is all I need  
Oh, oh, oh


I know way too many people here right now  
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just can't remember it all  
  
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?  
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin' me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over  
  
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it  
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?  
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'  
'Bout to set it off, in this bitch, Jada Pinkett  
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home  
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone  
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone  
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known  
'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas  
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers  
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers  
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker  
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either  
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer  
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds  
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)  
  
I know way too many people here right now  
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just can't remember it all  
  
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?  
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin' me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over  
  
One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain  
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane  
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game  
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'  
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher  
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper  
I really can't see the end getting any closer  
But I probly still be the man when everything is over  
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on  
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on  
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on  
If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on  
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?  
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old  
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?  
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh)  
  
I know way too many people here right now  
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just can't remember it all  
  
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?  
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over  
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over


How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter  
'Cause you know I'm okay  
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"  
When you know, you know I'm the same  
I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man fuck it I was on though  
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm  
Fuck it I was wrong though  
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free  
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me  
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some  
Long as the outcome is income  
You know I want it all and then some  
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum  
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from  
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from  
Yeah, you know me well nigga  
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga  
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga  
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah  
Are these people really discussing my career again?  
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again  
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?  
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?  
Man all of your flows bore me, paint drying  
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine  
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine  
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time  
It's been that way from the beginning  
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright  
  
[Chorus]  
I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?  
'Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far  
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States  
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case  
Red wine over Fed time  
But shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time  
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime  
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time  
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy  
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy  
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin' funny guy?  
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy  
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better  
I think maybe I was numb to it last year  
But you know I feel it now more than ever  
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay  
Second album, I'm back paving the way  
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon  
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day  
And I met your baby moms last night  
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!  
And I was drinking at the Palms last night  
And ended up losing everything that I came with  
Feel like I've been here before huh?  
I still got ten years to go huh?  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
These kids wear crowns over here  
And everything is all right  
  
[Chorus]


Own It  
It's yours  
  
Yours  
You're still the one that I adore  
Ain't much out there to have feelings for  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
Yours  
A few bottles on the table, a few waters  
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
Guess who's it is?  
It's yours  
  
Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love  
Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust  
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you  
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you  
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend  
Guess who's it is?  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
It's yours  
  
Own it  
I said go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Go own that shit  
  
Own it  
I said go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Go own that shit  
  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Just let that shit sink in  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Who could get the pussy quicker these days  
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days  
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days  
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story  
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"  
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours  
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money  
Y'all don't even really check for me  
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me  
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me  
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline  
You should call it  
When the last time you did something for the first time?  
You have done it all, swear to God  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days  
Broken telephone for every single conversation  
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days  
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours  
  
Own it  
It's yours, yeah  
It's yours, own it  
Own It  
Own It  
Own It  
Own It  
Baby, own it  
It's yours  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit


Intro:  
  
Would've came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I can't let it go  
Whether that's right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I would've came back  
But I would've came back for you  
Would've came back  
Would've came back...  
  
Verse 1:  
  
I talk, slicker, than a, pimp from Augusta  
Who just had his linen suit dry cleaned  
Bitches what's up witcha  
I hate callin' the women butches, but the bitches love it  
I took some sence and made a nickle of it  
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers  
With those lips that all that lipstick covers  
You're never too groen up to miss and hug her  
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubers  
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers  
This ain't the life that I'm used to  
Re-introduced to people I've been intoduced to  
Did you forget me?  
Or are you took scared to tell me that you met me and fear that I wont  
Remember  
I wish you could still accept me for me  
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad  
The simplistic beauty that all them southerners had  
I'm half way across the world with dozens of bags  
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd  
In one nigga, amazin' shit  
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit  
Ion drink every bottle I own  
I be agin' shit  
And I got them wedding ring flows that engaging shit  
Which one of y'all got fleets on your key chains  
The seats to these Heat games  
I think that you stare at yourself and you see things  
La familia, I've been inducted and instucted  
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with  
Fuck is up?  
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices  
23 and goin' through a mid-life crisis  
But tust me I still deliver like a mid-wife  
And no I'm not syin' I'm the nicest  
I just live life like it  
Uh, It a certain type of man to teach  
To be far from hood  
But to understand the streets  
I never threw away that paper with my grammy speech  
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach  
Yeah, You gotta own it if you want it  
Kisses her on the body  
She tells me live in the moment  
And baby I never forget none of that  
Girl I told you I was comin' back  
  
Chorus:  
  
Would've came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I can't let it go  
Whether that's right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I would've came back  
But I would've came back for you  
Would've came back  
Would've came back


Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it  
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high  
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood  
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume  
Go, go!  
  
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)  
You ain't never gotta say (woo!)  
And I know your taste is  
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)  
Everybody else basic  
You live life on an everyday basis  
With poetic justice, poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?  
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you  
When you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen  
Better yet where your friends and them?  
I really wanna know you all  
I really wanna show you off  
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne  
Cold nights when you this name  
You called up your girlfriends and  
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that  
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party  
don't approach her with that Atari  
that ain't good game, homie, sorry  
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell  
But I could never right my wrongs  
'less I write it down for real, P.S  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You can get it, you can get it  
You can get it, you can get it  
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want  
Poetic justice, put it in a song  
  
I really hope you play this  
'Cause ol' girl you test my patience  
With all these s photographs and all these one off vacations  
You've been taken  
Clearly a lot for me to take in  
It don't make sense  
Young East African Girl, you too busy with your other man  
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane  
Take you and your mama to the motherland  
I could do it, maybe one day  
When you figure out you're gonna need someone  
When you figure out it's all right here in the city  
And you don't run from where we come from  
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice  
You were so new to this life but God you got adjusted  
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun  
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big in that sundress (ooh  
Good God, what you doing that walk for?  
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less  
And we would talk more  
And they say communication save relations, I can tell  
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real  
P.S  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I write these words they become a taboo  
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true  
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof  
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?  
I mean you need to hear this  
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror  
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe  
Call me crazy, We can both be insane  
A fatal attraction is common  
And what we have common is pain  
I mean you need to hear this  
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering  
drive when you swerve, I want that interference  
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm  
That's your heartbeat  
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm  
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines  
Sincerely, yours truly  
And right before you go blind  
P.S  
  
[Chorus]


Cash money shit, cash money shit  
  
I can tell that money's got you working  
We've been talking for so long  
Now we're finally here in person  
I taste pain and regret, in your sweat  
You've been waiting for me, oh ho  
I can tell that you been practicing  
I can tell that you been practicing  
All those other men were practice, they were practice  
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me  
  
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up  
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up  
Call me Big Daddy won't you back that ass up  
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up  
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
  
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last yeah  
Hoes frown when you pass yeah, they mad yeah  
Couple thousand on your bag yeah, fuck yeah  
I'm a big timer nigger yeah, money flipper yeah  
Get it understood yeah, it's all good yeah  
Girl I know it's real cause I've been around it  
You only want what's real you just never found it  
Don't give them no more chances, ooh girl they had their turn  
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them  
But when I get you to myself  
You know what's going down, what's going down  
  
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up  
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up  
Call me Big Daddy won't you back that ass up  
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up  
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
  
I know he messed up  
But let a real nigger make it right  
Let a real nigger make it right, you deserve that much  
Let me put something in your life  
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life  
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with  
I'ma trust you I'ma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'ma love you  
You can even call me daddy, I'll give you something to look up to  
All my girls from the five o four, need to drop it right now,  
Need to drop it right now, all my girls from the five o four, need to drop it
right now  
Need to drop it right now, all my girls from the five o four need to drop it
right now  
Need to drop it right now, all my girls from the five o four, need to drop it
right now  
Need to drop it right now  
  
After you back it up then stop  
After you back it up then stop  
Baby girl, after you back it up then stop  
After you back it up then stop  
  
I can tell that money's got you working  
Got your body so wet  
Now we're finally here in person  
I taste pain and regret, In your sweat  
You've been waiting for me, oh ho  
I can tell that you been practicing  
I can tell that you been practicing  
All those other men were practice, they were practice  
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me


[Intro]  
Yeah, I get it  
I get it  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 1]  
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?  
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?  
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?  
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?  
I lost my way  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Oh please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else  
I gave your nickname to someone else  
I know you're seein' someone that loves you  
And I don't want you to see no one else  
I don't want you here with no one else  
I don't wanna do this with no one else  
I used to know you back when you was young  
Your brother brought me through, you saw me  
That made me think of you so differently  
I miss the feeling of you missing me  
But you say you're over and done with me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw, please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Say to you  
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah  
Say to you  
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you  
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?  
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you  
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you  
And they both say that you're over and done with me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you  
Aw please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now  
  
[Verse 4]  
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women  
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it  
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision  
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment  
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me  
That mean a lot to me  
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me  
This year for Christmas I just want apologies  
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'  
Syn had a baby and treated me different  
Erika sued me and opened a business  
Wonder if they wish it could've been different  
Wonder what they'd do put in my position  
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?  
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions  
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven  
Tryna satisfy everybody  
It's like they can't get enough  
Until enough is enough  
And then it's too much  
You tip the scale when I weigh my options  
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten  
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'  
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems  
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'  
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet  
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit  
Sell my secrets and get top dollar  
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover  
Opportunity and temptation  
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation  
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'  
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?  
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'  
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'  
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven  
  
[Outro]  
Yeah  
I know


[Verse:]  
Can I, can I save you from you?  
Cause you know there's something missing  
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all
the time  
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah  
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen  
To the things that I must say to make you mine  
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine  
Trying to convince myself I've found one  
Making a mistake I never learned from  
  
[Hook:]  
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type  
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I believe in people like you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl  
I bet there's a reason for it all  
You say that you're nothing like the last girl  
I just pray that you don't let me down right now  
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours  
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break  
And end up like before  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober  
Telling me how you moving away and starting over  
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit  
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit  
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it  
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it  
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson  
It's feeling like the second chance and it's the first impression  
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new  
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you  
Talking to myself but I never listen  
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different  
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go  
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about  
How reckless I have been  
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in  
Making all the same mistakes  
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it  
And I fall...  
  
[Hook:]


I can see it in your eyes, you're angry  
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now  
Mad cause he ain't like me  
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take, all the love that we made  
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia  
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man  
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man  
Don't you forget it  
The way you walk, that's me  
The way you talk, that's me  
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?  
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me  
And the voice in your ear, that's me  
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are, then I made it  
And you're wasted with your ladies  
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me  
A shot for me  
A shot for me  
  
Okay look, I'm honest  
Girl I can't lie, I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you  
She says I know you changed, I never see you  
Cause you're always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you  
And heaven accept you


[Chorus]  
How did I end up right here with you  
After all the things that I been through  
Its been one of those days  
You tryin' forget about  
Take a shot and let it out  
Let's get right  
Now that I'm here baby  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good  
Show me a good  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
  
I live for the nights that I can't remember,  
With the people that I won't forget  
Spending all the money I just work my ass off  
For the things that I won't regret  
I've been waiting way too long long long long  
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on  
I ain't tryin' look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with  
That's my team, never would I let a woman come between  
What we doing right now  
This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream  
I'm the Osirus of the shit right now  
Go to god for the hits right now  
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now  
If you can't hold your liquor you better quit right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How 'bout you and all your morals and that outfit that you borrowed  
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow  
Understand girl, we fam' girl  
Can't get me right and not do Wayne  
Cash money young money pop champagne  
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain  
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg  
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich  
And start livin' that life dawg  
Feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya  
They would do it just like I do if they could  
Its in our nature  
Ah, young and rich and out of control  
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer  
I came up in the underground though  
So I'm a spend another ten thousand for Dilla  
Call me over-rated or created or too jaded  
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good  
Show me a good  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)

Side pieces  
I know that you're watching this from home  
I can't wait to see you on the road  
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out  
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about  
I tell her you're just a friend  
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end  
I'm asking would you be mine  
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45  
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2  
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do  
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you  
This goes out to all my side pieces  
Side pieces, side pieces  
This goes out to all my side pieces  
You know that you'll never be the main one  
City to city I see you wearing the same one  
Side pieces, side pieces  
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces
Brian McKnight one time  
  
[Brian McKnight]  
This is dedicated to all the side pieces  
I know you'll never be more  
And you'll always be less  
But there's courage in knowing that you're ok being shit  
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team  
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me  
(Don't be embarrassed)  
Side pieces where you at  
(Probably in the top balcony)  
I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back  
(They can't even see us)  
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces ya  
Side pieces

You haven't been a man for like a minute  
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul  
You can really get to business  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
Rolling swishers hittin' swishers  
Got me feelin' like a ball hog  
I don't pass 'em when I get it  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
You too worried 'bout the bitches  
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it  
She'll admit it, she'll admit it  
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas  
And just like ever single other thing in my life  
You can have her when I'm finished

Phone call back home, she is hot up in the 6 boy  
Shit hot up in the 6 now shit hot up in the 6 boy  
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now

Black Benz on the road boy  
Already had a Rolls Royce  
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys

I give a fuck about his squad boy  
I give a fuck about your mob boy  
I'm the real 6 God boy  
I'm about to say a true thing  
I'm about to say a true thing  
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a you-chain  
God damn you changed  
I put it on 'erything, it's a er'tin'  
It's a ovo come through murk thing  
I know you heard things  
Bitch I know you heard things  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
I'm not new to this  
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side  
I'm not new to this  
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side  
I'm not new to this  
I'm not new, I'm not new  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
Nobody likes us except for us  
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up  
Yeah, my sound got the whole city a way right now now  
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now


[Verse 1:]  
Hey girl,  
Do you want my number?  
That way you can call me  
Everytime I come into town  
And then I will drive up to your house  
And take you out to dinner  
I don't expect nothing at all  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
Hey girl,  
I'm back in Atlanta  
Second dates are lovely  
This time you should choose where we go  
Need suggestions?  
How about the movies?  
Mini golf or ice cream  
I'm not picky, you'll let me know  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
Maybe we should slow it down  
If you're ready,  
We can go all the way.  
We can go all the way..


[Verse 1: Drake]  
This is all God's doing man you can't plan it  
But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic  
Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it  
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic  
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish  
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded  
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish  
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it  
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas  
Man I'm only 29 have some patience with us  
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga  
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga  
Shit ain't been the same like before  
I still love it but I used to love it more  
Face time with my shawty on tour  
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war, yeah  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end  
Make me call my bros for assistance  
You gon make me call my bros for assistance  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Put me in a fucked up position  
You gon make me call my bros, for assistance  
Make me call my bro  
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]  
Baby I'm a savage I ain't romantic  
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic  
And they pockets going under like the Titanic  
Got some head last night and it was outstanding'  
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now  
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now  
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now  
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now (blasting)  
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss  
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch  
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit  
They the type to stand in line for some free shit  
Babygirl gon suck it 'till her jaws locked  
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block  
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin'  
We the one droppin', niggas we the ones  
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come  
You that nigga snitchin' on your people huh  
21 savage aka the reaper huh  
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin' huh  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end  
Make me call my bros for assistance  
You gon make me call my bros for assistance  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Put me in all fucked up position  
Make me call my bros, for assistance  
Make me call my bro  
  
[Verse 3: Drake]  
I don't need love I'm the G.O.A.T  
I just hit the beat and float  
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show  
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know  
Cause if I don't share the wealth  
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow  
Mom's stressed theres a lot of things we need  
Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe  
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreeze  
Jordan pull up in the TL now I'm cheese  
I'mma turn this TSX to a Benz soon  
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon  
150 inch screen in my bedroom  
6'1" man that nigga need some leg room  
Shit ain't been the same like before  
They ain't even wanna look up at the score  
Face time with my shawty on tour  
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end  
Make me call my bros for assistance  
You gon make me call my bros for assistance  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Put me in all fucked up position  
Make me call my bros, for assistance  
Make me call my bro


Falling too fast  
Clearly rules don't apply  
Can't believe that I just met you  
You got me here  
Watching minutes past by  
Wondering when to expect you  
There you go  
Is this a dream  
Looking like every picture  
That I've seen of you before  
I've seen it all before  
Now that it's over. I shoulda known better  
  
Then you think this is real and  
You could be mine  
I should have known better  
Slowed it down cause I feel  
You needed time  
  
But I kept thinking  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be  
This could be  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be something  
  
Maybe it's just nothing at all  
But this could be something  
This could be something  
This could be  
This could be  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be something  
  
Maybe it's just nothing at all  
At all... At all...  
Maybe it's just nothing at all  
At all... At all...  
  
I guess it's what we make it  
  
I guess it's what we make it  
  
I guess it's what we...


Verse 1:(Drake)  
  
I Forgot To Call You On Your Birthday,  
You Swear You're The Last Thing On My Mind,  
There Is Nothin' I Can Do To Fix It,  
(All You Ever Asked Me For Was Time)  
When The Lights Don't Glow The Same Way That They Used To,  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself,  
I Will Realize You Were Everything I'm Missing,  
And You'll Tell Me You're In Love With Someone Else  
  
Chorus:(Drake)  
  
So Can You Do Me A Favor, If I Pull It Together,  
Make It Sooner Than Later,  
We Won't Be Here Forever, And I Realized I Waited Too Long,  
But Please Don't Move On,  
You Don't Need No One Else  
You Don't Need No One El-El-El-El-Else  
You Don't Need No One Else  
You Don't Need No One El-El-El-El Oh Ho Ho  
You Don't Need No One Else  
  
Verse 2:(Drake)  
  
You Just Changed Your Hair And It Looks Perfect,  
Wish I Was The First To Let You Know,  
Every Chance I Get To Make It Better,  
I Just Find A Way To Let It Go,  
When The Lights Don't Glow The Same Way That They Used To,  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself,  
I Will Realize You Were Everything I'm Missing,  
And You'll Tell Me You're In Love With Someone Else  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Verse 3:(Drake)  
  
The Girl Of The World, You See Someone Gotta Lose  
I Thought I Can Have It All, Do I Really Gotta Choose  
What Good Is All The Cash, If It Doesn't Buy Time,  
And What Good Is Bein' Famous, If I'm Never On Your Mind,  
Nights Fallen, Lights Glowin' And I'm Just Tryna Pay The Price Owin',  
And I Don't Wanna Feel The Comfort From My Ice Showin',  
And I Ain't Tryna Be Without You At The Right Moments,  
Nigga Nice Goin',  
Is It Worth It, That Decision,  
Cause Hearts Breakin', I Ain't Tryna Be In That Collision,  
So Imma Dust My Shirt, And Fix My Pants,  
Cause I Better Look Good Girl If This My Chance, I Swear  
  
[Chorus:]


[Intro: Lil Wayne]  
Thats what they doin' Cameron, they actin' like these singers man. I ain't
goin' to the studio until I have a situation. A subject, I need a beat, I need
the producer. Who gonna be on the hook? Man what is you doin? We're in the
studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!  
  
[Verse 1]  
Brand new beretta, can't wait to let it go  
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?  
Yeah I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho  
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold  
I ain't reply, let 'em know I read it though  
Voice mail say she ready though  
Niggas know I'm credible  
Ain't no pussy on a pedestal  
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal doin' 90 on the bridge like  
Nigga you already know  
And if you don't know, now you know, now you know  
Switchin' up the angles  
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel  
Four or five chains made of gold getting tangled  
My nigga Biz said "the first mil gonna change you"  
Change for the better, hit it then dead her  
Thats my vendetta, keep this shit together  
God damn we ain't even got a scam  
Cocaine Coupe, we ain't even gotta scale  
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked  
Ain't a damn thing changed you can still get to work  
(Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you)  
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no
longer in service)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'  
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass  
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life  
Now I'm in the east cause my boys are gettin' right  
Man, I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year  
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear  
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own  
So I started askin' them if they would put me on  
And they did put me on  
Yeah, the did put me on  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line  
Line blowin' up, workin on the phones  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones  
But I just couldn't do it had to leave that shit alone man  
  
[Skit]  
Hear what? [?]  
(Laughing)  
Ahh, no shit

In fright, in fright in our sleep, alright [?] Drizzy  
  
[Hook]  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up

Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing  
  
[Verse 3]  
I do better with the writer in my system  
Oh yeah, I'm on deck when you call me I'll listen  
I listen unless I been mixin'  
You know when I'm mixin'  
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink its tradition  
Like Zoe mama I go hippy  
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon  
I'm mixin', I am not Esco but it was written  
I knew when they didn't  
I been had these visions of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy  
All I just had to do was go and get it  
  
[Hook]  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing


I'm performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed  
Pay me in advance and make sure that it's exact  
My ex girl'll probably show up for the simple fact  
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack  
But?  
This about me  
They say my whole fan base is missin I'd  
What the young trend settin musician I be  
Got critics givin up the recognition I de-serve  
Never bring yo mrs. By me

If I get one wish imma wish to die free  
They say gon head, ball like mrs.?  
And I do

Lets make a toast, tell yo friends come closer  
Drinks on me like a coaster

That's all I got to say, at the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner  
Long awaited, hated  
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated  
It's about time that you made it  
I was bumpin yo songs when nobody else played it  
When I was up in? in atlanta steady givin daps  
Fetchin niggas drinks but I never got to rap?  
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped  
But I can't sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and  
No one decides who the definition of talent is  
And mrs.? look at what my talent did  
And what yo business is?  
It's been a couple years  
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it  
It's always awkward to... a nigga artist  
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest  
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach ya  
My plan just hatched, happy easter  
I'm doin it big  
Look at what I done  
Look at where I'm is  
It's only just begun  
Cause I was stayin home  
When they was havin fun

That's all I got to say  
At the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner

And I never trust a nigga sayin trust me

So you tell... don't you dare interrupt me  
Thanks to my mother for never givin up  
You deserve the world, now gon live it up

And to my dad even though we was apart

I'll forever forgive anybody that neva was there  
For me, no other woman could ever compare  
My angel I hope heaven's prepared for wheneva you there  
Uhh, I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario comin through ya stereo  
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go  
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go  
And this verse deserve a... ?  
Don't cry for me this ain't motha fuckin mario  
Yeah, and polo isn't at my session  
It's the anticipation keepin everybody guessin like  
Look at what I done  
Look at where I'm is  
It's only just begun  
Cause I was stayin home  
When they was havin fun  
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won  
And this is how my speech goes  
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit  
That's all I got to say  
At the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner


[Verse 1]  
I've been out walking  
I don't do too much talking these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things, I forgot to do  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've met some women  
I wish I had resisted these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think  
About how I have failed  
To change all of my ways  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 3]  
Yeah, I had a lover  
Don't think I'd risk another  
These days  
These days  
And if I seem to be afraid  
Just listen to the life I've made in songs  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 4]  
I've stopped the dreaming  
I don't do too much scheming  
These days  
These days  
I sit inside chauffeur car  
With windows down and count the stars  
These days  
These days


Yeah  
Ninth wonder  
They tend to say that us rappers  
Are materialistic  
They say we lak substince  
Me tay and L  
Bout to prove them wrong dou  
  
(Chorus)  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin

Pushing beard whips  
Chains clinkin love  
Well you don't really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you don't really kno me like you think you kno me  
  
(DRAKE)  
They don't be sayin that I'm humble  
And I'm hella nice  
But I've been approached ta sellma rockafella twice  
Niggas tell you all the rumors dey heard  
And we laugh  
Soon as you come and tell me  
Lik I'm ellen brice  
Ma groove theorie  
Is that when yu to cheery  
They try to bring you down  
To the level they at  
Well when they are all unhappy  
And it gets a little sticky  
That's why I am little nikki  
To these devils in rap  
But uh  
They aint thinkin drake is smart girl  
They probley think I brake ya  
Heart gurl  
I can't lie  
You probley right about it  
And if you give me dat ass quick  
I probley write about it  
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound  
I mean I spit that influencial shit  
From my town  
I don't know why you sittin on the couch  
When you see I got a bed  
Bring your ass here and lie dwn  
You kan take your purse off  
And later on we takin shirts off  
And then your skirt off  
At least I got status because I could have been a local MC and you probley
would be worst off  
So ima take dis hat off  
And ima hit it till I'm back soft  
And den I back soft  
Cus you thinkin you could prevent what happen  
  
You the reason I think I'm gettin sick of rappin  
  
(Chorus)  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin  
Nd drinkin love  
Pushing beard whips  
Chains clinkin love  
Well you don't really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you don't really kno me like you think you kno me  
  
(Tay)  
You probley think I walk around wit ma gun tucked in  
Swing dick to dis hoes lik nun chucks well  
You can think what you want but  
I think you been watchin to much BET uncut  
You need ta get real  
And check out ma real life  
I aint a tip drill  
Dnt kare wat it smell lik  
But if you feel lik  
Puttin all your noshins aside  
And talkin to a real nigga  
I gladly ablige  
First name fontay  
I'd b pleased ta date you  
College educated  
Got degrees and paper  
But I'm from the south were if you aint snappin or rappin bout trappin  
Yous a freak of nature  
Such a animalie  
Speak so well  
And talk so collegie  
Such a astonishing contrast  
To all the bullshit youve been following  
On ma behalf of dem I offer ma apology  
Maybe wit me you'll unlearn  
Puttin all niggas in a box of concerns  
Me cus I aint them  
Shit I'm well read like sun burn  
And afta me you'll neva leave  
No stone unturned  
  
(Chorus)  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin

Pushing beard whips

Well you don't really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me

If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you don't really kno me like you think you kno me


[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone [x2]  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Look,  
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players  
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin  
Because They Swimmin In Women  
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors  
They Come In Secret Flavors  
That's Why I Envy Omar  
Because So Far, I'm Nowhere Close To Malik and Deja  
  
And that's Some Higher Learning  
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On  
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot  
With The Tires Burnin  
And I'm A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith  
In Any Female that's Askin What I Was Earnin  
I Met This Recent Lady  
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners  
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe  
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby  
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me  
It's Like I'm Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy  
Now I'm Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately  
I'm All Alone, I Got A Feelin it's On  
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces  
Circling Workplaces  
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is  
They Get To First Bases  
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin  
Theye Wanna Know What The First Trace Is  
Now You Like Macgyver  
Cuz You Sneakin Around  
And She don't Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her  
I can't Relate To That  
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years  
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact  
  
I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It  
With Yoshi Lee And A. Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In  
And In The End I Listen But I don't See Me As They Do  
Cuz it's My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife  
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World  
Maybe I'm Confused About What I Desire From Girls  
Either Way I'm All Alone, Got A Feelin it's On  
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone  
  
[Verse 3: Drake]  
Check,  
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That  
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin  
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet  
But there's Logic Behind It  
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up  
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It  
I Tend To Freak With This  
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin  
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss  
Thinkin She Been Spoiled  
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days  
And Come Up With Tin Foil  
  
We Could Dissect It See  
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets  
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing  
Gave Her Nothing  
Her Reputations In Jeopardy  
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me  
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me  
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me  
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling I'm Wrong  
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone


Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Done saying, I'm done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's putting shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it  
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?  
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"  
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out  
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now  
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family going backwards  
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing  
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing  
Look, I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that
shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit  
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me
like I'm "him" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you


[Intro: DMX]  
What these bitches want from a nigga?  
  
[Verse 1]  
On some DMX shit  
I group DM my exes  
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever  
And I think we just get closer when we not together  
You tell me that I'm confusin'  
More immature than Marques Houston  
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution  
We too deep in this thing you'll never lose me  
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'  
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off  
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras  
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars  
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off  
And my house is the definition  
Of alcohol and weed addiction  
You got a different vision  
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen  
Without runnin' into one of my niggas  
That's not the way we livin'  
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic  
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em  
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people  
But every time we speakin'  
  
[Hook]  
It's like a lot of games bein' played  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
It's like a lot of games are bein' played  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs  
Where you're getting me  
All that grey in our conversation history, you  
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things  
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing  
Slide on a late night  
You like to slide on a late night  
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite  
That's that shit that I don't like  
We both slide on a late night  
Do things in our off time  
We both, yeah  
Made some mistakes, pon road  
Yeah, how's that for real?  
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal  
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still  
While you're typin' make sure you tell me  
  
[Hook]  
What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Remember you was livin' at The London for a month  
Service elevator up to 4201  
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front  
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front  
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'  
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different  
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things  
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'  
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need  
And on my way to make this dough  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!  
Tryna give your ass the world  
You runnin' your fingers through my curls  
You knew me when the kid had waves  
But that's enough of that  
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass  
And that's some real shit


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water  
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape  
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder  
Can't even steer straight, I can't even steer straight  
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots  
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot  
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it  
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven  
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit  
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit  
I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts  
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about  
Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches  
And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches  
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was  
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was  
That's what's important and what really happened before this  
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans  
Singing walking like a man, finger on the trigger  
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah  
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves  
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways  
  
[Chorus]  
People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll  
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)  
  
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance  
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance  
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good  
Do me like the women from my town would  
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors  
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for  
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back  
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack  
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth  
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south  
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like  
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like  
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade  
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid  
If I don't nothing I'ma ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living  
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways  
  
[Chorus]


My name is Drizzy  
And I ain't perfect  
But I work hard  
So I deserve it  
And I belong right where you see me  
I ain't on the fence about it  
I ain't Mr. Feeny  
Naw, I got a decent set of manners  
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner  
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour  
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and  
Live like Princess Diana  
So often they have addictions and  
I'm no one that'll feed it  
But truly you're bad enough  
That you don't even really need it  
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit  
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snappin  
Candids of you and yo posse partying  
Drinking watch you get handed  
With your virgin island tans  
All lookin like you just landed  
I don't really understand it  
I'm not sure I'm comprehending it  
But these girls are having fun with  
Whoevers money they spending screaming  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
I got to be unstoppable  
I got to be unstoppable  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
  
[Verse 2:] Weezy F. Baby  
  
My name is Weezy  
I'm almost perfect  
And I work harder than hardworking bizarre circus  
That's when my bars surface  
Therefore, I act a clown  
Even when I'm laying on my back,  
I'm never backing down  
So overstand me  
I gotta condo in Miami and  
My doormat is always sandy  
And I run Louisiana  
But I've never pull a hammy  
And I gotta condo in Atlanta  
And I always wear a bandana  
And when it comes down to stuntin you boys  
Is just buntin  
I'm swinging from the fence  
Yo girl hanging from my dick  
Yo girl singing to my shit  
Like a la, la, lollipop  
She say I get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop  
She say I get that pussy better  
Better than her gynecologist  
Hoe just text me  
Everybody want some mo dick mo dick  
Old bitch  
Young bitch  
But I'll be like damnnnn  
All I got is one dick  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
[Bridge:] Santogold  
  
I got the talk  
The beats and bass  
Give me one I'll take it  
Make you lose your place,  
Tell me I-I-I can play  
So I speed up the pace  
I break it break it you can't stop me  
In this ra-race  
  
[Chorus 2x]


Yeah, uh huh  
  
Uh, hardly home but always reppin',  
You hardly on and always second,  
When I'm awake you always restin',  
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,  
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions,  
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin',  
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,  
I just always did my own thing,  
Now I run the game, you stupid mudda-suckas  
I see all this money through my Ohio State buck eyes,  
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better,  
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her  
  
[Chorus]  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
You can run an tell your friends that  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
Best believe I understand  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
You can run an tell my city  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
You can run an tell my city it's on  
  
Yeah, wrong way down a one way,  
Women don't get saved 'round me even on a Sunday,  
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,  
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em "Drake is just a younger you"  
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house  
Or there'll be shots on T-M-Z, of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth,  
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,  
I drive two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an' Martin Luther  
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,  
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,  
Have you countin' money goin' duffle bag crazy,  
Sippin' on Pink Floyd an puffin' Wayne Brady,  
Damn, who's line is it anyways,  
I'm in a daze, you been amazed,  
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,  
I'm on fire, yup I've been a blaze,  
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,  
You look nice, and yo' frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike  
Well alright, guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will,  
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real  
Put it to you like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,  
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,  
That gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,  
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,  
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,  
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this iBomb,  
I palm the game like its a Splading ball and take flight,  
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike  
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this goin' be a great night,  
Look at all these posers bite, our swagger like a great white,  
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,  
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,  
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long,  
The best that ever did it an doin' it on a new song,  
U-G-K an Young Money too strong  
Bound to be in the green like a crouton,  
So what the fuck is you on?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy  
I own the swagger supermarket an' you, you just a bag boy  
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy  
Hate an' I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy  
Soo woo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch  
An' I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel bitch  
I'm so uptown, and motherfucker look at Wayne  
Don't go uptown yeah  
And now I'm on this rock shit,  
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin' in a mosh pit, ha ha  
Fuck is you talkin' bout, Weezy in ya mouth now  
Weezy whatchu talkin' bout  
(Young mula baby!)  
  
[Chorus]


[Intro:]  
The only thing I'm seeing I'd like to put an amend on  
Perhaps a little more room here for the fixins  
Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins  
We gonna have so many fucking fixins up in this motherfuckers  
His shit gon' go through the roof  
Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days  
  
[Hook:]  
Nigga we made it, hey

Nigga we made it, hey  
Damn, we made it  
Nigga we made it, hey

[Drake]  
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office  
The head was so good it make sense why you work at the head office  
In 2007 I sat in a lobby in Motown and waited  
Now I go into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"  
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'  
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments  
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement  
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!  
You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies  
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is  
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous  
Imma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"  
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me  
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"  
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"  
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"  
  
[Interlude]  
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow
down  
Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show  
  
Hey  
We made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
Damn, we made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it, aye  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it  
  
[Drake]  
If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it  
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it  
Ovo reps them so P Reign next up, watch he about to go crazy  
When Baca came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"  
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it  
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience  
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it  
I would just look at you dead in the face and say "Nigga we made it"  
I swear that we made it  
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no
favors  
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)  
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it  
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's
amazin'  
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women
we came with  
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the
pictures I painted  
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it"  
  
[Hook:]  
Hey  
We made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
Damn, we made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it, aye  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it  
  
[Soulja Boy]  
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good  
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas  
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish  
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!  
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed  
Ha, nigga we made it!  
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it  
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"  
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters  
And these days I don't need no favors  
Nigga we made it!


Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive  
But I still treat it likes it's do or die  
Even though dying isn't in the plans,  
But neither was making it and here I am  
In the presidential do you like your new room?  
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon  
Since I saw Aliyah's precious life go too soon,  
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it  
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street  
Got a new condo, move it to the beach  
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib  
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)  
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming  
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing  
  
The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?  
Well fuck let's get it then  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm trying to let go of the past  
Should we make this one a double?  
You ain't even gotta ask, ah  
Because it's hard to say no, say no  
Yeah it's hard to say no  
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time  
(Every time, every time, every time)  
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine  
(We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)  
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time  
(Every time, every time, every time)  
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine  
(We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)  
  
Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man  
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man  
You keep talking that "You was this and you had this  
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it."  
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line  
And the line around the corner it's my motherfucking time  
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.  
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now  
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?  
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?  
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known  
She said "you're such a dog" I said "you're such a bone."  
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?  
These days women give it to me like they owe me one  
But they crave attention though they always saying "Show me something."  
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one  
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that  
Then fuck let's get it then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, Drizzy. Yo turn nigga!  
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)  
Give these niggas the business nigga!  
Kill spray anything in the way nigga, fuck em! We don't love em!  
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit  
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas, Drizzy, with the realest flow  
Toast to this gangsta shit. OVO-YMCMB  
You understand me?  
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing  
Rubber band stacks. That YMCMB shit nigga, flashy lifestyle, one hundred
