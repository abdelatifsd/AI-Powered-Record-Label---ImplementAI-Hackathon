Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?


Take it easy with me, please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
Take your time, make it slow  
Andante, Andante  
Just let the feeling grow  
  
Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul, you know how  
Andante, Andante  
Go slowly with me now  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
There's a shimmer in your eyes  
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down


I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together


Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me


Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra


Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita


I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
"There is something", you said, "that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way"  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world


I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sitting all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sittin' all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
  
Cryin' over you  
I'm cryin' over you  
Cryin' over  
Little memories of things we used to do  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you


Oh, my love it makes me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one more  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye  
  
Yes, all we have to do is  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Yet it seems to make me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one last  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you  
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away  
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?  
So dance while the music still goes on  
It's gonna be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you  
  
(fade)


You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for the place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave them burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen


Changing, moving in a circle  
I can see your face in all of my dreams  
Smiling, laughing from the shadows  
When I hear your voice, I know what it means  
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try  
You're all the reason for my life  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking, wondering what you're doing  
I can't stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then, they never shared our love  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have


You're so hot, teasing me  
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you  
That's something I couldn't do  
There's that look in your eyes  
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild  
Ah, but girl you're only a child  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Better slow down girl  
That's no way to go  
Does your mother know?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Try to cool it girl  
Take it nice and slow  
Does your mother know?  
  
I can see what you want  
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun  
So maybe I'm not the one  
Now you're so cute, I like your style  
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)  
But girl you're only a child  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Better slow down girl  
That's no way to go  
Does your mother know?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Try to cool it girl  
Take it nice and slow  
Does your mother know?  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?


Agnetha We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie  
So what's the use to pretend  
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy  
You've got to face it my friend  
  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
  
We're gonna make it together  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better  
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me  
  
How I love you, girl  
When I hold you, baby, can't you see  
That's the way we whirl  
You had your hopes and your high expectations  
  
Somehow it doesn't seem right  
I'm getting fed-up with your acquisitions  
I'm not your angel in white  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
We're gonna make it together  
  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better  
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me  
How I love you, girl  
  
When I hold you, baby, can't you see

Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
We're gonna make it together  
And within, it's a fuss  
  
So we can only get better


I can hear how you work, practising hard  
Playing night and day, wo-oh  
And it sounds better now, yes you improve  
Everytime you play, wo-oh  
But it's bad  
You're so sad  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling fiddle  
  
But I think, you don't know that I exist  
I'm the quiet kind, wo-oh  
From the day when I first listened to you  
You've been on my mind, wo-oh  
You don't care  
It's not fair  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling find


They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell  
I love hearing the stories that they tell  
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
They speak strangely but I understand  
  
And I dream I'm an eagle  
And I dream I can spread my wings  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please  
  
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?  
  
Is it true I'm an eagle?  
Is it true I can spread my wings?  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please


Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
It's sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still we're going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
It's true  
  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star

It's true


Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...


Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw


Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room.


Half past twelve  
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day


There's a gentleness to everything you do  
And it's rubbing off on me I feel it too  
I've been waiting but my loneliness I get  
When you call me on the phone  
And I'm feeling so alone  
When you ask me to come over  
Baby you know I will  
I could never stay on my own  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more


You say she's been mad at you  
Then you say you'll be patient, ooh  
Still I see that she makes you blue  
Come on, I'll give you consolation  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
  
Just to be where you want to be  
So much fun we could have then, hmm  
To be close for eternity  
What a miracle to happen  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
'Cause you don't please her like you please me  
  
You're my life, you're my angel  
You're my first, you're my last  
Would she care if you lingered  
For another night  
Want to hold you tight  
We could make it right  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
And I would love to sing my love song  
For you


When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
When the air gets cold then I think of us  
Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days


Agnetha, Frida Early this morning I drove in the rain  
Out to the airport to get on the plain  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
Alice has been there, she said it was fun  
  
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
  
Guess I've been working a little to hard  
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card  
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii  
It's so exciting, why should I pretend  
  
In a few hours the plane will descend  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
I can imagine the beach and the sand  
Walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
I've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
Someone is waiting and I forget you  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii


No more champagne  
And the fireworks are through  
Here we are, me and you  
Feeling lost and feeling blue  
It's the end of the party  
And the morning seems so grey  
So unlike yesterday  
Now's the time for us to say  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Sometimes I see  
How the brave new world arrives  
And I see how it thrives  
In the ashes of our lives  
Oh yes, man is a fool  
And he thinks he'll be okay  
Dragging on, feet of clay  
Never knowing he's astray  
Keeps on going anyway  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Seems to me now  
That the dreams we had before  
Are all dead, nothing more  
Than confetti on the floor  
It's the end of a decade  
In another ten years time  
Who can say what we'll find  
What lies waiting down the line  
In the end of eighty-nine  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I


Benny I was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
And my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
But then it happened one night  
As I got into a fight  
I could hear someone saying  
As though he was praying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
I was a woman, never thinking of others  
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
But then I happened to meet  
A begging man in the street  
As I turned down his praying  
I heard someone saying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way


I have a very good friend  
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
Her man is one I admire  
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
(She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)  
And she goes  
Head over heels


Love, love is a dream  
We were like two young strands of driftwood  
Caught up in a stream  
We were destined for each other  
From our very first hello  
We came bustin' through that river dam  
And made that river flow  
We will sail upon the ocean  
Til the shoreline meets the sky  
Carried on the first trade wind  
That favours you and I  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
Life, oh life is a chance  
We were the only two who spun the wheel  
And never scored romance  
If we'd stayed to play for fortune  
We'd have broke the banks of gold  
We'd have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above  
We will spend our lives together  
Forever hand in glove  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
Here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
So we are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away...


So at last you're free  
It's the way you wanted it to be  
And the price you paid  
To become a woman of today  
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
(Yes you can)  
  
So you're free at last  
And beginning to forget the past  
Does it make you sad  
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had  
But you're right, you had to take a second chance  
So you fight to find your freedom  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
What's the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Don't you know what to do  
(Yes you do)  
(Yes you do yes you do)  
(Yes you do yes you do)  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
What's the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Don't you know what to do  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)


You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(You know you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul


Honey honey, how you thrills me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I'd heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine  
Oh, you make me dizzy  
  
Honey honey, let me feel it, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, don't conceal it, ah-hah, honey honey  
The way that you kiss goodnight (The way that you kiss me goodnight)  
The way that you hold me tight (The way that you're holding me tight)  
I feel like I want to sing when you do your thing  
  
I don't want to hurt you, baby, I don't want to see you cry  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, touch me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, hold me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
You look like a movie star (You look like a movie star)  
But I know just who you are (I know just who you are)  
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine


I am just a girl  
One among the others, nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
It's so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
La, la, la, la la  
  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl


i am the city, you let me be  
i am the city  
  
Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The parks and the squares that you see  
All the sounds that you hear  
And the air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
I am the city  
You let me be  
I am the city  
  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
  
Coming through a cloud  
You're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats


Love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it  
Don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too?  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past  
Now I've just made it  
I found you at last  
So come on  
Now let's try it  
I love you  
Can't deny it  
'Cause it's true  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me  
If we can't make it  
But just wait and see  
  
So come on now lets try it  
I love you, can't deny it  
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
So love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it, don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a fantasy  
To help me through reality  
And my destination makes it worth the while  
Pushing through the darkness still another mile  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream


I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs  
No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak


I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it ain't too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But I'm looking through your lies  
It doesn't really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey, I will miss you  
'Til the day I die  
'Til the day I die  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
This boy cries


This park and these houses, old streets I have walked  
Everything dear, will it be here  
One day when I am returning?  
My friends will get married, have children and homes  
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise  
Never expecting surprises  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong  
  
My friends and my family, this dull little town  
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed  
Everything old and familiar  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it...  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong

I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it, oh yes  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong


I got appointments, work I have to do  
Keepin' me so busy all the day through  
They're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you  
Oh baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it  
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say  
And I lose my temper ten times a day  
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
No-one to turn to, you know how it is  
I was not prepared for something like this  
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss  
Oh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it  
I got my business to help me through the day  
People I must write to, bills I must pay  
But everything's so different when night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights


You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refuge  
  
Something's wrong  
Got a feeling that I don't belong  
As if I have come from out of space  
Out of place, like King Kong  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Like a doll  
Like a puppet with no will at all  
And somebody taught me how to talk  
How to walk, how to fall  
  
Can't complain  
I got no one but myself to blame  
Something's happening, I can't control  
Lost my hold, it's insane  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Look this way  
Just a little smile is what they say  
You'll look better on the photograph  
If you laugh, that's o.k.!!  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refugee


I, I've been in love before  
I thought I would no more  
Manage to hit the ceiling  
Still, strange as it seems to me  
You brought it back to me  
That old feeling  
  
I, I don't know what you do  
You make me think that you  
Possibly could release me  
I think you'll be able to  
Make all my dreams come true  
And you ease me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
  
I, I'm gonna make you mine  
You're gonna feel so fine  
You'll never want to leave me  
I feel you belong to me  
Someday you will agree  
Please, believe me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
Oh, I've been waiting for you


Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
Like I always do  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
I was sick and tired of everything  
When I called you last night from Glasgow  
All I do is eat and sleep and sing  
Wishing every show was the last show  
(Wishing every show was the last show)  
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming  
(Glad to hear you're coming)  
Suddenly I feel all right  
(And suddenly it's gonna be)  
And it's gonna be so different  
When I'm on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
Facing twenty thousand of your friends  
How can anyone be so lonely  
Part of a success that never ends  
Still I'm thinking about you only  
(Still I'm thinking about you only)  
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy  
(Think I'm going crazy)  
But it's gonna be alright  
(You'll soon be changing everything)  
Everything will be so different  
When I'm on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
So I'll be there when you arrive  
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive  
And when you take me in your arms  
And hold me tight  
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Su-p-per Troo-p-per)  
Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per troop-p-per)  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
Sup-p-per Troop-p-per lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one


Just a notion that's all  
Just a feeling that you're watchin' me  
Every move I'm making  
Am I reading your mind  
Cause it's almost like you're touching me  
There is no mistaking  
Just a notion  
That you'll be walkin' up to me  
In a while  
And you smile and say hello  
Then we'll be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right  
  
Just a notion  
But somehow I know I'm not wrong  
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do  
But tonight is very special  
It's the night for me and you


Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night  
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah  
I really had to write a song about it  
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock 'n roll band  
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah  
I know that everybody's gonna shout it  
  
And what a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus:]  
We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along  
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong  
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along  
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom  
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song  
  
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place  
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah  
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?  
So people get together, gonna have a good time  
Everybody listen to the music, yeah  
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky  
  
So let your arms hang down  
And waddle all around  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart  
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
(I'm at the point of no returning)  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions


No more carefree laughter  
Silence ever after  
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes  
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye  
  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
We just have to face it, this time we're through  
(This time we're through, this time we're through  
This time we're through, we're really through)  
Breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(I have to go this time  
I have to go, this time i know)  
Knowing me, knowing you  
It's the best i can do  
  
Mem'ries (mem'ries), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)  
They'll be (they'll be), with me (with me) always (always)  
In these old familiar rooms children would play  
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say  
  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
We just have to face it, this time we're through  
(This time we're through, this time we're through  
This time we're through, we're really through)  
Breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(I have to go this time  
I have to go, this time i know)  
Knowing me, knowing you  
It's the best i can do


I wasn't jealous before we met  
Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice  
You've heard me saying that  
Smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
It was like shooting a sitting duck  
A little smalltalk, a smile  
And baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what  
You've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me


Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room


Spring in the air  
The sun was shining  
Still the day was cool  
Saw her waiting for a bus  
As she was going home from school  
  
Looking so cold  
I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away


Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Ain't heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat  
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
Patience  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love isn't just a sensation  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)

(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough


I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
How I remember the first time we went to movie  
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
And I feel so good  
And I feel so right  
And I know that you must have a lovelight  
  
You've got lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere  
Maybe even when you're not there  
You've got lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
Everything about you is right  
Let it glow and let it be bright  
I don't want to lose your lovelight  
Shining like a star in the night


Sit down and listen 'cause I've got good news for you  
It was in the papers today  
Some physician had made a discovery  
This' what she had to say:  
(oooh you know that)  
  
She said that every result she had backed her  
Claiming that love's a longevity factor  
  
So lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
What a feeling when I hold you tight  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah  
  
I can imagine, I'll see in my fantasy  
I'll enjoy every day  
Making love is a dynamite drug, baby  
So why don't we start right away  
(ahh, please don't wait)  
  
I don't care if they're watching 'cause listen  
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing  
  
'cause lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
What a feeling when I hold you tight  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah  
  
I just don't care if they're watching 'cause listen  
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing  
  
'cause lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
What a feeling when I hold you tight  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah  
  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah


[Chorus]  
Mamma mia, here I go again  
My my, how can I resist you?  
Mamma mia, does it show again  
My my, just how much I've missed you?  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go  
I've been angry and sad about things that you do  
I can't count all the times that I've told you "we're through"  
And when you go, when you slam the door  
I think you know that you won't be away too long  
You know that I'm not that strong  
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring  
One more look and I forget everything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, even if I say  
"Bye bye, leave me now or never"  
Mamma mia, it's a game we play  
"Bye bye" doesn't mean forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go


Did you see that man in the limousine  
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
But she doesn't care, and she never will  
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
Just as long as he pays the bill  
  
Did you see that man with a fat cigar  
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
He can choose the wine from a vintage year  
He will drink champagne in his limousine  
Where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
But you see that man made a big mistake  
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
And the money too, all that he can spend  
He can buy the most, nearly anything  
But he can't buy the lot, his friend  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)


Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
I remember all the games we used to play  
I really do  
And I went to see them almost everyday  
I wanted to  
Though we quarreled at times and had a few fights  
We were the best of friends  
We found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
They would take me out for football games and such  
They liked to play  
And I guess I didn't like it very much  
But anyway  
I was happy and proud to be with the boys  
Being a little girl  
I found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days


Sometimes when I'm mad  
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad  
Sometimes when I scream  
There's a voice in me that says, "You shouldn't be so mean"  
Oh no, oh no  
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside  
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Sometimes I have toyed  
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud  
Nothing new of course  
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors  
Oh no, oh no  
I just want to say a lot of that applies to me  
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Me and I  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I


I have tried in vain never had success  
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess  
I have lost my only friend  
Now it seems I have to start again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Looking for someone  
Who would want to stay  
I might find her  
With a bit of luck one day  
  
But who knows  
So until then  
I can only try and try again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round


Well, you wake up in the morning  
Hear the ding-dong ring  
You go marching to the table  
See the same old thing  
See the fork on the table  
Nothing in your pan  
If you sing a thing about it  
You're in trouble with the man  
  
Let the midnight special shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me  
  
If you ever go to houston  
Well, you better act right  
And you better not gamble  
And you better not fight  
For the sheriff will arrest you  
Then he'll take you down  
And before you understand it  
You are prison bound  
  
Let the midnight special  
Shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special  
Shine it's ever loving light on me  
On me, on me


I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay  
Ain't it sad  
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me  
That's too bad  
In my dreams I have a plan  
If I got me a wealthy man  
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind  
Ain't it sad  
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me  
That's too bad  
So I must leave, I'll have to go  
To Las Vegas or Monaco  
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
It's a rich man's world


They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.  
A voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.  
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside.  
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself  
I've always tried.  
  
Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion  
Move on  
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing  
Move on  
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning  
Move on  
How I treasure every minute  
Being part of it, being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind  
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time  
And somewhere lies the answer  
To all the questions why  
What really makes the difference  
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la)  
Being in it (la la la la)  
With the urge to move on  
  
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea  
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me  
I see it and I hear it  
But how can I explain  
The wonder of the moment  
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
Like a wind that's always blowing  
La la la la la la-la  
La la la la la la-la (life is flowing)  
La la la la-la (move on)  
Like the sunrise in the morning  
La la la la la la-la  
La la la la la la-la (life is dawning)  
La la la la-la (move on)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
Like a wind that's always blowing...  


I've seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phrase  
So now we'll go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again, nothing I can do  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
I've watched you look away  
Tell me is it really so hard to say  
Oh, this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight we're trough  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
  
Yes, I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only


Tried to sneak out without saying  
With my loudest record playing  
Ooh, my mama said, "Look at this, you haven't done your bed"  
My mama said, "That's a thing that you should do instead"  
  
Then I did what she had told me  
Dying for my friend to hold me  
Ooh, my mama said, "Try and get one thing into your head"  
My mama said, "Pa and me, we give you room and bed"  
How I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
In the morning she said "Listen"  
Ooh, I felt like in a prison  
Yeah, my mama said, "I know you've been out again with Fred"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
I said I can live without it  
How I wish you wouldn't doubt it  
Ooh, my mama said, "If you want to hurt me go ahead"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "I suppose you'd rather see me dead"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life [Repeat: x4]


Every day in the morning on her way to the office  
You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
She would like to play it every day  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play


I was at a party  
And this feller said to me  
Something bad is happening  
I'm sure you do agree  
People care for nothing  
No respect for human rights  
Evil times are coming  
We are in for darker nights?  
I said who are you  
To talk about impending doom?  
He got kinda wary  
As he looked around the room  
He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone


No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table  
Though I would have liked to begin  
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable  
You leave and you slam the door  
Like you've done many times before  
And I cry and I feel so helpless  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Outside I can see the sun trough the open window  
Inside everything feel so cold  
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
Somethimes when I just can't cope  
I cling to a desperate hope  
And I cry and I feel like dying  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up  
The sound of a key in the door  
You smile and I realize that we need a shake up  
Our love is a precious thing  
Worth the pain and the suffering  
And it's never too late for changin'  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
You and me till' the end


They passed me by, all of those great romances  
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances  
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy  
And so I dealt you the blow  
One of us had to go  
Now it's different, I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
  
I saw myself as a concealed attraction  
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving  
That's how I started the show  
One of us had to go  
Now I've changed and I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
Never left at all  
  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  


The summer air was soft and warm  
The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away...


People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
Man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
To keep him company  
Women always knew that it takes a man to get  
Matrimony and harmony  
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down  
Wants some female company  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Gotta have love 'til eternity  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man

Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain  
Like a woman needs a man  
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon  
Then he'll take it down if he can  
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
Isn't that what you call a friend  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Isn't it easy to understand  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand

Put on your white sombrero  
Saddle your horse my dear  
And ride off into the sunset  
You'd better go  
For there is no  
Place for you here  
Like and old fashioned hero  
You stand before me  
You think our life is a movie  
My world is real  
I live and feel  
And I can do without you  
Put on your white sombrero  
Your red bandana too  
Think of this day as a showdown  
Goodbye my friend  
This is the end  
For me and you  
Now be a bold vacquero  
Don't show your feelings  
I'll cry while you're disappearing  
Into the night  
All dressed in white  
Unchained and free without me  
Put on your white sombrero  
Like all the cowboys do  
Go find a sweet senorita  
Somebody meek  
Who'll never speak  
Harshly to you  
You're such a cavaliero  
Proud, never bending  
I want someone who will take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  
You'll never take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  


You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music  
Getting in the swing  
You come to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music  
Everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another  
Anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen, digging the dancing queen

I was sitting by the phone  
I was waiting all alone  
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you  
It's a dark and dreary night  
Seems like nothing's going right  
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?  
  
Yes I'm down and feeling blue  
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all  
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Won't you please understand the need in me  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
  
You were here and now you're gone  
Hey did I do something wrong?  
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken  
Was it me or was it you?  
Tell me, are we really through?  
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking  
  
Please forgive and then forget  
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

Sitting in the darkest corner  
In the tender light I saw her face  
She was looking so sad and lonely  
Someone help me, someone save me  
I could see the look she gave me, oh  
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only  
That I knew I could do  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n'roll band  
Let's go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
You've been sitting there for hours  
Try to hide behind the flowers now  
Baby, we could have fun together  
Come on, cheer up, let's get started  
No use being broken-hearted now  
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better  
Yes I know that you will  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band

The poster on the wall of a dear friend  
I wish there was a way that I could show you how your songs set me free  
The hero of them all  
You're a legend  
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you  
Still you're close as can be  
  
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, Rubber Ball Man  
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, Rubber Ball Man  
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still  
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming  
Look at your fans, how we love you, Rubber Ball Man!


Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love?  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
  
You seem so far away though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?


Frida  
He stands  
Towering over me beside my bed  
Losing his head  
  
Tells me  
I must take him seriously  
Droning on the usual way  
He's such a clever guy  
  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
He's dressed  
In the striped pyjamas that I bought  
  
Trousers too short  
Gives me  
On his small philosophy  
Carries on the way he does  
  
And me I get so tired  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
Agnetha, Frida  
  
High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
  
Agnetha,  
Frida High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
  
To grow in size  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
  
And save cocoon  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry


See me sitting in the palm tree  
Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine


Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that I'm losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
(Slipping through my fingers)  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile


You think you're gonna make me sulk, you and your fancy car, ah-ha-ha  
But I can tell you honey your tricks ain't gonna get you far, ah-ha-ha  
They say that money's got a magic touch  
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today, ah-ha-ha  
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away, ah-ha-ha  
The girls might fall for everything you've got  
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long


Do I hear what I think I'm hearing  
Do I see the signs I think I see  
Or is this just a fantasy  
Is it true that the beast is waking  
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight  
In the pale moonlight  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble  
Won't somebody tell me what I hear  
In the distance, but drawing near  
Is it only a storm approaching  
All that thunder and the blinding light  
In the winter night  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance


And when I see the sign that points one way  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I forced to cry  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
Still find a way to haunt me  
Though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame


Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city


Suzy was nine and I was ten  
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men  
She used to follow us at school  
We really thought that she was a little fool  
And one day we said to her  
We don't want to hurt you girl  
But you'd better  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around  
  
Suzy went home to Mama's arms  
Mama said "Look, she's never done you no harm  
So get off her back and let her be  
Why can't you play together in harmony?"  
We really didn't know what to say  
But as soon as she went away  
We laughed and said  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around  
  
Yes you'd better  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie  
If you put me to the test, if you let me try  
  
Take a chance on me  
(That's all I ask of you honey)  
Take a chance on me  
  
We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together  
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better  
'Cos you know I've got  
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you  
It's magic  
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair  
But I think you know  
That I can't let go  
  
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie  
If you put me to the test, if you let me try  
  
Take a chance on me  
(Come on, give me a break will you?)  
Take a chance on me  
  
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you  
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you  
Let me tell you now  
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough  
It's magic  
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind  
No I can't let go  
'Cos I love you so  
  
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see  
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me  
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)  
  
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see  
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me  
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)  
  
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa ba-ba  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  


I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing  
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing  
I'm so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it out loud  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
She says I began to sing long before I could talk  
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?  
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
Like a melody can?  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair  
I wanna sing it out to everybody  
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me


Are you sure you want to hear more  
What if I ain't worth the while  
Not the style you'd be looking for  
If I'm sweet tonight  
Things look different in the morning light  
I'm jealous and I'm proud  
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Would I be the one you seek  
Mild and meek like the girl next door  
Don't you realize  
I may be an angel in disguise  
It's lonely to be free  
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
I don't believe in fairy-tales  
Sweet nothings in my ear  
But I do believe in sympathy  
That's me, you see  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Won't you have a drink with me  
Just to see you're not really sore  
I can't help my ways  
I'm just not the girl to hide my face  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
There's a special love  
Like an eagle flying with a dove  
I'll find it in the end  
If I keep on searching, but until then  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me


I must have left my house at eight, because I always do  
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came


I believe your new girl turned you down  
And they say she's pushin' you around  
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride  
Tell me my friend how many nights you've cried  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Was it hard to step down from your throne  
And to know tonight you're all alone  
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl  
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The word is all around  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown


I've seen you twice, in a short time  
Only a week since we started  
It seems to me, for every time  
I'm getting more open-hearted  
  
I was an impossible case  
No-one ever could reach me  
But I think I can see in your face  
There's a lot you can teach me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game?  
Does it mean anything to you?  
What's the name of the game?  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know  
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What I'm trying to conceal  
If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
  
The name of the game  
  
I have no friends, no-one to see  
And I am never invited  
Now I am here, talking to you  
No wonder I get excited  
  
Your smile, and the sound of your voice  
And the way you see through me  
Got a feeling, you give me no choice  
But it means a lot to me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)  
(But it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know  
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What I'm trying to conceal  
If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
Oh yes I wanna know  
  
The name of the game (I was an impossible case)  
Does it mean anything to you? (But I think I can see in your face)  
(That it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Can you feel it the way I do? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)  
(But it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (I was an impossible case)  
Does it mean anything to you? (But I think I can see in your face)  
(That it means a lot)  


They came from the hills  
And they came from the valleys and the plains  
They struggled in the cold  
In the heat and the snow and in the rain  
Came to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
They came from the south  
From the west and the north and from the east  
They waited for the man  
Like a parish is waiting for the priest  
Longed to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
He gave them a dream  
He seduced everybody in the land  
The fire in his eyes  
And the fear was a weapon in his hand  
So they let him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon


I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move, I'm standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books, the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they don't dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now they've come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isn't unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror ever growing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up


You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh, I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do


I don't want to talk  
About the things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  
I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's my destiny  
  
I was in your arms  
Thinking I belonged there  
I figured it made sense  
Building me a fence  
Building me a home  
Thinking I'd be strong there  
But I was a fool  
Playing by the rules  
  
The gods may throw a dice  
Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear  
The winner takes it all  
The loser has to fall  
It's simple and it's plain  
Why should I complain.  
  
But tell me does she kiss  
Like I used to kiss you?  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name?  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed  
  
The judges will decide  
The likes of me abide  
Spectators of the show  
Always staying low  
The game is on again  
A lover or a friend  
A big thing or a small  
The winner takes it all  
  
I don't want to talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all


The city is a jungle, you better take care  
Never walk alone after midnight  
If you don't believe it you better beware  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream  
Some of us will dream it forever  
Look around the corner and try not to scream  
It's me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a prison, you never escape  
You're forever trapped in the alleys  
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
And if I meet you, what if I eat you, I am the tiger  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger


Come to my loveland, wander along  
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs  
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand  
Here's the two bluebirds, won't you come to my land  
  
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue  
My paradise is waiting here for you  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Come to my loveland, wander with me  
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree  
Over the rainbow, under the moon  
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?  
  
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything  
The secrets that my paradise can bring  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
(I want to share it with you)  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
(It's a tropical loveland)  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you


He had what you might call a trivial occupation  
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station  
With no romance in his life  
Sometimes he wished he had a wife  
He read the matrimonial advertising pages  
The cries for help from different people, different ages  
But they had nothing to say  
At least not until the day  
When something special he read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
He called the number and a voice said: "Alice Whiting"  
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  
He was amazed at his luck  
The purest streak of gold he'd struck  
He said: "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling  
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  
Why don't we meet for a chat  
The three of us in my flat"  
I can't forget what I read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
She said: "I'm sure we must be perfect for each other  
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain when you meet my mother"


Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go  
My resistance running low  
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so  
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)  
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me  
I don't have a strategy  
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
But I want to know, should I want to, I'm not sure  
  
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so  
Really let my anger show  
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite "no"  
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)  
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well  
Something like a magic spell  
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I would know how

People everywhere  
A sense of expectation hanging in the air  
Giving out a spark  
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark  
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end

We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more

You move like a flame of fire  
Your eyes like a flash of lightning  
You lie since you're cold inside  
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing  
You'd better watch out  
I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go I'll find you  
Watch out  
I'll be staying close behind you  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
Oh, you'd better watch out  
I said you'd better watch out  
  
You speak and you're funny lately  
You act like I was a stranger  
I think you're beginning to hate me  
But then you're a girl in danger  
  
You'd better watch out  
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go I'll find you  
Watch out  
I'll be staying close behind you  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
So you'd better watch out  
Yes I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Watch out  
  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
I said you'd better watch out  
Oh girl you'd better watch out  
Ah, you'd better watch out  
Oh, ah, you'd better watch out


My my  
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender  
Oh yeah  
And I have met my destiny in quite a similiar way  
The history book on the shelf  
Is always repeating itself  
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war  
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo  
  
My my  
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger  
Oh yeah  
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight  
And how could I ever refuse  
I feel like I win when I lose  
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war  
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo  
  
So how could I ever refuse

Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey, what's it good for anyway?  
So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then there's only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Traveling up the Nile  
(Didn't he do it?)  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
(Didn't that help them? Well, didn't it?)  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)


Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill  
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
Birds of passage, you and me  
We fly instinctively  
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor  
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done


Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher  
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)


When you were lonely, you needed a man  
Someone to lean on, well I understand  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired, you throw them away  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me.


Frida Now there's a shadow falling over our faces  
Doubt forever in our hearts  
And in a while we'll start to pick up the traces  
We won't find the missing parts  
  
Buy me a ticket, I'll go to the Bahamas  
I need a rest from our petty little dramas  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha, Frida Aha, mm  
  
Now look what you've done  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
  
It's my turn to run  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Frida I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion  
  
I was taken by surprise  
Now both of us are in a state of confusion  
Hesitation in our eyes  
Something unwanted has entered our existence  
  
I think it's better to view it from a distance  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha, Frida Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha


Always have, always will  
I was mesmerized when I first met you  
Wouldn't let myself believe  
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
But you didn't know  
That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything you'll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
  
Sometimes we try too hard to please  
We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I don't know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will


This is a song about a well-known girl  
Who was she?  
  
We will never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
We'll never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got  
If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?  
I wonder  
I wonder

Give it up for you, the one for me

Fire! I can see it burning so brightly  
Fire! I can feel it calling out to me  
And as the sun goes down  
It starts to paint a picture  
  
Of an ancient town  
So far away, across the endless sea  
Lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
  
I'm standing in the night  
Looking for the edge of heaven  
We'll be touching the edge of heaven  
Time  
  
Close your eyes see dreams of tomorrow  
Time  
The wheels are turning till eternity  
And as the darkness comes  
  
I start to see a picture  
Of a lonely man  
So clearly now reaching out for me  
Lead me to the light  
  
And sail the endless sea  
So lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
The edge of heaven is near  
  
We'll sail the endless sea


Tonight we're gonna have a good time  
Oh we're really gonna have a good time  
  
Tonight we're gonna have a good time  
Oh we're really gonna have a good time

Happy nation living in a happy nation  
Where the people understand  
And dream of the the perfect man  
A situation leading to sweet salvation  
  
For the people for the good  
For mankind brotherhood  
We're traveling in time

And over time we've learned from the past  
That no man's fit to rule the world alone  
A man will die but not his ideas

Hey darling  
Have to tell 'bout the world  
Have to tell you today  
Believe me now  
Believe me now  
You'd better believe in angels  
There's no other substitute  
We all do that before we're going up in the sky  
If your loving is in your money  
Know they cannot hug you back  
This is the sound of the world  
I know, I say, I do, I say  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl  
Take a look around  
Take a look around  
You're going to be burned out  
You must blame it on yourself  
You're burning your candlse both ways  
That I've learned from my past  
Quench your thirst with memories  
There's no point in being stressed  
That is the thing I have learned  
I've done, I've been, I've seen all that  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl  
Take a look around  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world

We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
"Life is a flower  
So precious in your hand  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
  
When every race is run  
And the day is closing in  
I don't care about the world  
I'm living for the light  
Don't cry for me today' ah ah ah  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
I can not be your judge  
Mr. Jailer is your host  
He's keeping you inside  
And hides you from the world  
No catcher in the rye  
Can help you from yourself  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
Please Mr. Agony  
Release them for a while  
"earn them the consequences of  
Living without life  
  
We live in a free world


The man in the moon has a thousand different faces  
The man in the moon changes colours each day  
He's watching us all  
The big and the small  
Can he see  
Just you and me  
Searching for my destiny?  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
Wanna be free and happy  
Have mercy on me  
Do you believe we can travel into the future?  
Do you believe there's a man in the sky?  
We're making him sad,  
The good and the bad  
Can he see  
Just you and me  
Searching for my destiny?  
Ohh  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
Wanna be free and happy  
Have mercy on me  
I don't wanna be just one in many faces  
I want you looking at me  
Sit down and take a look  
Put me into motion  
Give me something to believe  
Mmm hmmm mmm  
Mmm hmmm mmm  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Ohhh,  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me, mmm  
Oh,  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me


I'm never gonna say I'm sorry,  
I'm a clown for everyone  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
I'm always here like a sun  
  
I'm a looser, that is a fact for sure  
I'm happy even if you don't want  
To invite me out for a dance tonight  
I'm not normal, I know, I don't care  
I'm never gonna say  
  
I'm always here like a sun, I'm always here  
Like a ghost I follow your steps so true  
You don't have to bribe me or fill me up  
Give me just a minute to shine with you  
I will make you so happy, make you laugh  
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry for  
  
The essence of my soul  
There's so many ways to change my life  
'Cause I want to, oh  
I'm like a clown, I'm fun for everyone,  
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry


They say the time has come for us  
To start again  
I believe that's true  
They say the time has come for us  
  
To make amends  
And I believe that too  
Why tell me why  
Is it all so hard to find  
  
I pray each day  
For a perfect world  
Where children are laughing  
Lovers romancing  
  
Time stands still  
A perfect world  
There's nothing to cry for  
No one to die for  
  
Wonderful  
In a perfect world  
Our father's father says that  
Things were better then  
  
How easy they forgot  
On every page in every book of history  
A thousand tears were shed  
There's hope in our hearts  
  
And love in our eyes  
Day after day I keep searching  
Why tell me why  
Is it all so hard to find  
  
I pray each day  
For a perfect world,  
Show me the way I'm to understand  
That you prove to myself that I'm a man  
  
And you love, but you can't look from above  
Travel cross the seven seas to be with you  
Passion and desire will see me through  
The road that I must travel will wind and curl  
You're all I ever needed in a perfect world


I was born in the shadows  
Under the Iberian sun  
I was the dawn of the valley  
Under the Iberian sun  
  
I once was a sinner  
But who was not?  
I really liked to rumble and hustle a lot  
But where is the key monster  
He is not here  
I am just a gatekeeper  
Now so sincere  
Now so sincere  
Now so sincere  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
And where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be  
Who do I want to be  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be  
  
I went down to the river  
Trying to find peace in my mind  
In the throw  
I saw you glimmer  
The desire for you made me blind  
I first saw you at the distance  
When the moon's at its height  
I came to get to know you  
A disclosure so bright  
I knew, in my heart  
When your flair made me swoon  
I am just a prisoner  
In search of my tune  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
From where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be


Hello mudda, hello fadda  
Here I am at camp granada  
Camp is very entertaining  
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining  
  
I went hiking with joe spivy  
He developed poison ivy  
You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner  
  
All the counslers hate the waiters  
And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses  
  
I don't want this, should I scare ya  
But my bunk mate has malaria  
You remember jeffery hardy  
They're about to organize a searching party  
  
Take me home, o mudda fudda  
Take me home, I hate granada  
Don't leave me out in the forest  
Where I might get eaten by a bear  
  
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys  
O please don't make me stay

Let me come home, if you miss me

I'm sitting in my chair watching the TV  
It's not even on but there's plenty for me to see  
I just lit some crazy ass shit  
that my friend overnight mailed to me  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever tasted  
I think they fucking laced it  
Cause I'm so damn lambasted  
  
Oh my friend came over so I packed him a pipe  
I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype  
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it  
Two minutes later he was playing backgammon naked  
  
He's fucking wasted  
It's the best shit he ever tasted  
He's lost in fucking spaced-ed  
Cause he's so wicked wicked wasted  
  
Oh I spent the last two hours  
hiding under my bed  
Cause I looked in the garbage can  
and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
  
Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face  
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moonwalk all over the place  
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak  
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I've ever tasted  
My brain's been erased-ed  
Well fucking fried  
  
I'm sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat  
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet  
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe  
I said we ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever fucking tasted  
Oh fucking shit  
  
I'm way too baked  
  


I'm a big fuckin' dick  
I'm a pain in your ass  
I drink all your beer  
I'll eat the last slice  
I'll give you charley horses  
I'll pull your shorts down at the beach  
I always need a ride  
Nobody likes me  
  
My name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I spit when I talk  
I swear in front of your mother  
I throw shit at the movies  
I wear tight pants  
I ask you to buy an extra Yankee ticket  
And then I don't show  
I tell you I saw your girlfriend  
Fucking two guys at a party  
  
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I'll piss on your toilet seat and tell your dad you got stoned  
I'll borrow your jacket and never think of returning it  
  
Polychronopolous  
Pansy  
Pussy  
Shit for brains  
Douchebag  
  
I'll leave your gate open  
So your dog runs away  
I'll make fun of your pimple  
Then I'll grab your sister's ass  
  
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
And I don't care  
And I don't give a shit  
  
I'll break your brother's stereo  
And then tell him it was you  
You think you're better than me  
Well you're fucking wrong  
  
Everybody knows I'm Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
Deal with it

Welcome my son to your very first day  
So proud to be the one  
Who brought you this way  
I love you with all my heart  
And my love is here to stay  
But I can't help worrying  
Will you eventually smoke weed?  
  
Soon enough you'll be walking  
You and me hand in hand  
The silly words you'll be talkin'  
Only daddy can understand  
We'll go out making snowmen  
Building castles in the sand  
And all the time I'm thinking,  
Will this kid end up smokin' weed?  
  
But time keeps on going  
And you keep on growin'  
You're now six years old  
You're getting so good at your spellin'  
But my mind is always dwellin'  
On the fact that you  
Could be the kind of guy  
Who grows up and needs  
To smoke weed on the couch  
All the time  
All the time  
  
So answer me this while  
You're lying in your little bed  
Why must you insist on bein'  
Such a fuckin' pothead?  
There's other things in life  
That can make you feel good  
But you just keep on smokin' your herb  
You can't get enough of  
Your precious, precious reefer  
Where you getting all this money  
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?


[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?


[Verse 1]  
When did it go wrong, I will never know  
I have loved you all my life  
How did it slow down, I go round and round  
Thinking about it all the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
This love, it ain't over yet  
There's too much that I haven't said  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
Tell me was it all for the thrill?  
What was I thinking, I gave you everything  
But you still went for the kill  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark  
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat  
Do you even know that I can't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Hope you know, I won't let go


Found myself today singing out your name,  
You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you


Daydreamer  
Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like he's never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh  
  
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And you can tell that he'll be there for life  
  
Daydreamer  
With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus he's there for you  
When he shouldn't be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
There's no way I  
Could describe him  
What I'll say is  
Just what I'm hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life


[Verse 1]  
Hello, it's me  
I was wondering if after all these years  
You'd like to meet, to go over  
Everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me?  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Bridge]  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


[Verse 1]  
I want every single piece of you  
I want your heaven and your oceans too  
Treat me soft but touch me cruel  
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby  
Bring the floor up to my knees  
Let me fall into your gravity  
Then kiss me back to life to see  
Your body standing over me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Verse 2]  
I love the way your body moves  
Towards me from across the room  
Brushing past my every groove  
No one has me like you do  
Baby, bring your heart, I'll bring my soul  
But be delicate with my ego  
I wanna step into your great unknown  
With you and me setting the tone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Bridge]  
We play so dirty in the dark  
Cause we are living worlds apart  
It only makes it harder, baby  
It only makes it harder, baby  
Harder baby, harder baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Outro]  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you


Right under my feet there's air made of bricks  
Pulls me down turns me weak for you  
I find myself repeating like a broken tune  
And I'm forever excusing your intentions  
That I give in to my pretendings  
Which forgive you each time  
Without me knowing  
They melt my heart to stone  
  
[Chorus]  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Each and every time I turn around to leave  
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
So desperately I try to link it with my head  
But instead I fall back to my knees  
As you tear your way right through me  
I forgive you once again  
Without me knowing  
You've burnt my heart to stone  
  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Why do you steal my hand  
Whenever I'm standing my own ground  
You build me up, then leave me dead  
  
I hear your words you made up  
I say your name like there should be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love  
I'm the only one in love


Picture perfect memories,  
Scattered all around the floor.  
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it anymore.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.  
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk,  
And I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
I just need you now.  
Oh baby I need you now.


Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
It cuts through the deepest parts of me  
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry  
How I'm still trying to stay inside  
Hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Every now and then my memories ache  
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
But as time goes on and my age gets older  
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'Cause heart break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  


I heard, that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
I heard, that your dreams came true  
I guess she gave you things  
I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face  
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead


[Verse 1]  
Looking for something I can be  
The fact I don't think it would mean  
The first half and I love the newspaper  
And the only way you want a boycott of the best way  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
  
[Bridge]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Instead it will take the first half and I have  
Under pressure from the same as I am  
Whoever you can get the same as a result of the bestselling  
Great to have to do that in my room for a long day ahead with its own section  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
  
[Bridge]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
  
[Refrain]  
Whoever you can get the same as a result of the bestselling  
Great to have to do that in my room for a long day ahead with its own section  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this

I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
  
[Outro]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel...


[Verse 1]  
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
From the deepest part of my regret  
I hear the words I wish I'd said  
At the dawning of the day  
I can't wait to see the light  
Make up memories in my head  
They help to fill the emptiness you've left  
  
[Hook]  
I can't drown in your tears  
I won't face your fears  
I need to fight my own  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never see me again oh baby in time  
Let the wait take me under  
I know I'll survive  
You'll never see me again


All your love I miss lovin'  
All your kiss I miss kissin'  
All your love I miss lovin'  
All your kiss I miss kissin'  
  
Ever since I left you baby, I never knew what I was missin'  
All your love I miss lovin'  
All your kiss I miss kissin'  
All your love I miss lovin'  
All your kiss I miss kissin'  
Ever since I left you baby, I never knew what I was missin'  
  
All your lovin pretty baby  
That I had in store for you  
All your lovin pretty baby  
That I had in store for you-  
What could a poor boy do?  
All your lovin pretty baby  
All your lovin pretty baby  
All your lovin pretty baby  
What could a poor boy do?  
All your lovin pretty babay  
All your kissin is kissin  
All the lovin you gave me pretty babay  
Ever since I left you baby,  
I never knew what I was missin' aaaah


Put your biscuits in the oven  
Honey, put your buns in bed  
I wanna come inside your kitchen  
Wanna taste your shortening bread  
  
I want to jump into your skillet  
Honey, tickle your home fries  
I gotta hambone working fill it  
Won't you try it on for size  
  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Baby ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
Put your biscuits in the oven  
Honey, watch my dumplin  
  
Rise up - early in the morning  
Rise up - late at night  
Rise up - gotta get me a warning  
Rise up - gonna whet your appetite  
  
Gonna shake and bake you honey  
I want a catcher in the rye  
I wanna sop up all your gravy  
From your deep dish apple pie  
  
So open up your menu  
I wanna slice your honey dew  
I love it honey when you  
Do me like you do  
  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
And if you ask me no questions  
And tell me no lies  
Put your biscuits in the oven  
Honey, watch my dumplin  
  
Rise up - early in the morning  
Rise up - late late late at night  
Rise up - giving me no warning  
Rise up - gonna wet your appetite


I took a course in hallelujah  
I went to night school for the blues  
I took some stuff they said would cool ya  
But nothing seemed to light my fuse  
But it's all in the past  
Like a check that's in the mail  
She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes  
Because here comes the sun  
Ain't no surprise  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Gonna open up your eyes


Checkmate honey, beat ya at your own damn game  
No dice honey, I'm livin' on the astral plane  
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain  
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind  
Where to draw the line  
An Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor  
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store  
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me  
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time  
Know where to draw the line  
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs  
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long  
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime  
No dice honey, you're the salt, you're the queen of the brine  
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose  
Where to draw the line  
  
Checkmate, don't be late  
Take another pull  
That's right  
Impossible  
When you got to be yourself  
You're the boss, the toss  
The price, the dice  
Grab yourself a slice  
Know where to draw the line


Well I woke up this morning  
On the wrong side of the bed  
And how I got to thinkin'  
About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin' names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
'cause I'm sick of your complainin'  
About how many bills  
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just can't see no humor  
About your way of life  
And I think I can do more for you  
With this here fork and knife  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
So I called up my head shrinker  
And I told him what I'd done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah, I hope you have some fun  
And a don't go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
'Cause you won't get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But there's one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Believe in all the good things  
That money just can't buy  
Then you won't get no bellyache  
From eatin' humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance won't last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
Don't stop me now, I'm goin' crazy  
Eat the rich  
That's my idea of a good time baby


You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You think you're in love  
Like it's a real sure thing  
But every time you fall  
You get yo' ass in a sling  
You used to be strong  
But now it's "ooh baby please"  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
We was making love  
When you told me that you loved me  
I thought ol' cupid  
He was taking aim  
I was believer when you told me  
That you loved me  
And then you called me  
Someone else's name  
  
There ain't gonna be no more  
Beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these  
You're bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so  
  
Chip off the old block  
Man, you're so much like your sister  
My fantasize it must be out of luck  
My old libido has been  
Blowing a transistor  
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck  
Yeah  
  
I'm Jones' in' on love  
Yeah I got the DT's  
You say that we will  
Bbut there ain't no guarantees  
I'm major in love  
But in all minor key  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
What are you looking for  
It's got to be hard core  
Must be some kind of nouveau riche  
  
Is this your only chance  
Or some hypnotic trance  
Let's get you on a tighter leash  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You ain't that good  
Is what you said  
Down to the letter  
But you like the way  
I hold the microphone  
Sometimes I good but  
When I'm bad I'm even badder  
Don't give me no lip  
I've got enough of my own  
  
There ain't gonna be  
No more beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these  
You're bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
I'm jonesin' on love  
Yeah I got the DT's  
You say that we will, yeah  
But there ain't no guarantees  
I'm major in love  
But in all minor key  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees


I got a rip in my shoes  
And a hole in my brand new shoes  
I got a Margarita nose  
And a breath full of Mad Dog Booze  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Yeah, they threw me outta jail  
I tell ya it ain't fair  
I tried to kiss the judge  
From the electrica' chair  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
The guitar's cranked  
And the bass man's blown a fuse  
And when the whole gang bangs  
Then what is your excuse?  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever gives you lust with an appetite  
It hits you like the fangs  
From a rattlesnake bite  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
We can't run away from trouble  
There ain't no place that far  
But if we do it right at the speed of light  
There's the backseat of my car - caviar  
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day  
Now I'm feeling low down  
Even slow feels way to fast  
And now the booze don't work  
'Cause the drugs ran out of gas  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
The buzz that you're gettin'  
From the crack don't last  
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
My first time ever lover  
We fell asleep out on the lawn  
And when I woke up I was all alone  
Making love to the crack of dawn  
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir  
The gangster of love rides again  
You know I gotta chill  
It gimme such a thrill  
Like a burnin' plague  
Yeah get outta my way  
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear  
As long as I'm in heaven, honey I don't care  
You look so good baby, look so fine  
I tell you you're the image of a perfect crime  
You get so tired holdin' on so tight  
If you think you're goin' crazy  
Well you may be right  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight


Take me on your rocking horse  
Hit the lights and shut your doors.  
Grab your ankles , everyone.  
Ain't my way of having fun.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up,give it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, get it up, for your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
For your fantasies  
My ass don't speculate.  
I'm just your slave, your master's bait.  
And lots of luck into the night.  
Just waitin' for the bright light fright.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Really have a good time  
Really have a good time  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath her clothesline.  
Really have a good time.  
Love me til the sun...  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up,  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, gotta get it up, get it up, get it up,  
For your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
Get it up and down and all around.  
Take a ride and paint the town.  
Slow me down and make it fast.  
Scream almost and make it last.  
You know you gotta really have a good time.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath the her clothesline.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
You know you really want to love me till the sun can't get it up. Get it up.


For all night Dwight  
  
Got a '56 Cadillac  
With a spare tire on the back  
Got a charge account in my ol' bank  
Said, I ain't got you  
  
Got a classic and a pool  
And a big hair ghoul  
No matter who I fool  
Said, I ain't got you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Got a baby and a liquor store  
I played the number four-forty-four  
Got a mojo and don't cha know?  
I'm all dressed up with no place to go  
Got women to the left of me  
Got women to the right of me  
I got chicks all around me  
Said, I ain't got you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mr. Whitford  
You know I ain't got you baby


Well I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.  
  
I got an out of town pistol with the graveyard frame.  
It shoots tombstone bullets with a ball and chain.  
I'm drinkin' TNT and smokin' dynomite.  
I hope some schoolboy pick a fight.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well, I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.  
  
Now listen  
  
All you pretty little chicks with your curly hair,  
I know you feel like I ain't nowhere.  
But stop what you're doing honey, come over here.  
I'll prove it to you baby that I ain't no square.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well, I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.  
  
Well I'm drinkin' gin like never before.  
I'm feelin' so good honey that's for sure.  
One more drink honey I wish you would.  
It takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for, a ready for, a ready for  
Well, I'm ready for  
Oh baby, you know I'm ready for you.


Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done  
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun  
Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done  
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound, it's the sound...  
Nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...  
Nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her whole world's come undone  
From lookin' straight at the sun  
  
What did her daddy do  
What did he put you through  
They say when Janie was arrested  
They found him underneath a train  
But man, he had it comin'  
Now that Janie's got a gun  
She ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
Tell me now it's untrue  
What did her daddy do  
He jacked the little bitty baby  
The man has got to be insane  
They say the spell that he was under  
The lightnin' and the thunder  
Knew that someone had to stop the pain  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
What did her daddy do  
It's Janie's last I.O.U.  
She had to take him down easy  
And put a bullet in his brain  
She said 'cause nobody believes me  
The man was such a sleaze  
He ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Everybody is on the run  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
  
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey what's your problem)  
'Cause Janie's got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)  
Janie's got a gun (Was it daddy's cradle robbin')  
Her dog day's just begun (That made you scream at night)  
Now everybody's on the run  
Janie's got a gun  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun


Ruby red... her lips were on fire  
A do me with a kiss, if you please  
Tell me what your sweet heart desires  
Tell me how you want it to be  
  
'Cause if it's love you want  
Then you won't mind a little tenderness  
That sometimes is so hard to find  
  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
Make it alright  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
I'll hold you so tight  
(Lay it down)  
Oh...before the morning light  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Oh...lay it down  
Come and lay it down tonight  
  
Tell me how you feel when we make love  
Tell me is it real or just make believe  
You will never know what'chor made of  
'Til you open up your heart to receive  
'Cause if the love you got that same old crime  
We're talkin' tenderness that's so hard to find  
And I'm gettin' behind you  
  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
Make it alright  
(Lay it down)  
A lay it down  
I'll hold you so tight  
(Lay it down)  
Yeah... before the morning light  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Oh...lay it down  
Come and lay it down tonight  
  
Do you remember them times talkin' in your sleep  
With a pocket full of promises you never could keep  
From your best friends lover you dreamt about then  
When you pullin' up the covers the voices in your head  
  
Say if you want it bad  
Don't ever let it slip away  
  
'Cause if it's love you want and tenderness...yeah  
  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
Make it alright  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
I'll hold you so tight  
(Lay it down)  
  
Oh... before the morning light  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Oh...lay it down  
Gonna lay it down tonight  
Gonna come around tonight  
You gotta lay it down


Workin' like a dog fo de boss man  
Workin' for de company  
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'  
I'm gonna have a fantasy  
But where am I gonna look?  
They tell me that love is blind  
I really need a girl like an open book  
To read between the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground  
  
Jacki's in the elevator  
Lingerie second floor  
She said 'can I see you later  
And love you just a little more?'  
I kinda hope we get stuck  
Nobody gets out alive  
She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mail room  
Honey and have you home by five  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the air, in the air, honey one more time not, it ain't fair  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down  
  
Love in an  
Elevator  
Goin' down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a penthouse pauper  
Gonna be a millionaire  
I'm gonna be a real fast talker  
And have me a love affair  
Gotta get my timin' right  
It's a test that I gotta pass  
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey  
Kiss your sassafras  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you care? Do you care?  
Honey one more time now it ain't fair.  
Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down


Savin' all your money  
For a rainy day limousine  
Teenage baby send you  
Full friction magazine  
I don't know how she do it  
  
Up down turnaround  
Four on the floor tonight  
When she did what she was doin'  
She was rubbin' me the wrong way right  
Push come to shove  
Give it one more try  
Don't miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like A Birddog  
Never Learn to Fly  
  
Bareback baby  
Tell me what's on your mind  
If it's the same old same old  
Slap you on the back behind  
I don't know how you do it  
Tell me one time  
About how it used to be  
You got the judge and jury  
Swinging from the highest tree  
Push came to shove  
Give it one more try  
Don't miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
  
Bass drum beating  
Like a hot damn house on fire  
Love lover's quarrels  
Always seem to make the body cry  
I don't know how she do it  
Tell me one time  
About how it used to be  
She got the judge and jury  
Swinging from the highest tree  
Push came to shove  
Give it one more try  
You don't miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies


Ah yeah  
Love me two time baby  
Love me twice today  
Love me two time girl  
I'm goin' away  
Love me two time girl  
Once for tomorrow, once just for today  
Love me two time I'm goin' away  
  
Love me one time, girl  
I could not speak  
Love me one time, baby  
You know my knees got weak  
Love me two time girl  
Love me all through the week  
Love me two times I'm goin' away  
Love me two times I'm goin' away  
Yeah  
  
Love me one time  
Could not speak  
Love me one time, baby  
You know my knees got weak  
Love me two time girl  
Love me all through the week  
Love me two times I'm goin' away  
  
Love me two time baby

Once for tomorrow, once just for today  
Love me two times I'm goin' away, yeah  
Love me two times I'm goin' away  
Love me two times I'm goin' away, yeah


Oh... when you cross that line that you know you can't erase  
To fall in lust not love ain't no sin at all  
And tell me when your wit'chor best friend's friend  
Do you still feel outta place  
No thanks I took that ride  
God only knows I tried believin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
The first time you look for love  
You find you don't know jack... yeah  
So much for mind games you play to win  
'Cuz first you lose your heart's desire  
Then you get it back  
But ignorance ain't bliss  
There's so much more behind the kiss...I'm feelin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me  
God help the person...fff...who needs me...yeaah  
If ignorance is bliss then take me off the list  
I'm leaving  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their hearts and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies


Somebody better call a doctor, doctor  
Or wake me up with a shove  
I'm gonna knock you off your rocker, rocker  
'Cause I think I'm in love  
I tried to get a message to ya  
But you walked the other way  
I need your magic touch, don't you know  
I've got a habit and I can't let go  
Feel the fire burnin' slow  
You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't let go  
Don't need no wedding with a shotgun, shotgun  
So don't you push me too far  
Don't try to take me for a fool child, who child  
Do you think that you are  
You really got it coming to ya  
It's gonna come as no surprise  
I need your magic touch, don't you know  
I'm after you and now I can't let go  
Take it easy, take it slow  
You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't let go  
You never know what you got  
Till they take it away  
I'm comin' ready or not  
Gonna get you some day  
I need your magic touch, don't you know  
I'm after you and now I can't let go  
Feel the fire, burnin' slow  
I got a habit and I'm back for more  
Your magic touch, don't you know  
I'm after you and now I can't let go  
Feel the fire, burnin' slow  
You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't, can't, can't let you go


Good evening people, welcome to the show  
Got something here I want you all to know  
When laughin' people bring on primal screams  
You got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams  
Make it  
Don't break it  
I said make it  
Don't break it  
Do then ya feel like the world's coming down on you  
You know that history repeats itself  
But you just learned so by somebody else  
You know you do, you gotta think up fast  
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last  
Make it  
Don't fake it  
Said make it  
Don't fake it  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
Don't be catchin' the blues  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
What have you got to lose  
You're only paying your dues  
If you're gone I'll get you anyway  
Although you know what you've been going through


It ain't easy, livin' like a gypsy.  
Tell ya, honey, how I feel.  
I've been dreaming,  
Floatin' down stream and  
Losin' touch with all that is real.  
Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover  
Never knowin' where ya been.  
You've been fadin', always out paradin'.  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
  
Well you've always got your tail on the wag.  
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon.  
You act like a perpetual drag.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
It ain't easy, livin' like ya want to,  
And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is.  
The way I see it, you've got to say shit.  
But don't forget to drop me a line.  
  
Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen.  
And workin' for you dad is just a drag.  
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
Tell her where you've gone and been.  
Livin' out your fantasy,  
Sleeping late and smoking tea.  
  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
Tell her where you've gone and been.  
Livin' out your fantasy,  
Sleeping late and smoking tea.  
  
It ain't easy, livin' like ya want to,  
And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is.


The streets were cold and barren  
The nights were dark and dank  
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....  
The buildings were dead and the alleys  
Stunk from things that used to live there  
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered  
  
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his  
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence  
With not a scrap left on the plate  
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable  
Cause the only thing left was their faith  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do  
About it....  
  
There's a Meltdown in the sky  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....  
  
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago?  
You could hear screams and moanin'  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of God's knife  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....  
  
There's a Melt Down in the Sky  
There's a new day comin and I don't know why  
There's a tear stuck in my eye  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died  
  
There's a Meltdown in the sky  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....


Hush-a-bye my baby soft and new  
Ooh her loveliness, gypsy dance in the rain  
Hush-a-bye my baby what you do  
Ooh, the baby cries, the wind she's a-callin' your name  
Mia  
  
Where you came from you ain't alone  
Live and loved from the old jaw bone  
Ahh don't you cry, you're home sweet home  
  
Rock-a-bye sweet lady gypsy blue  
Ooh, the nightingale's singin her song in the rain  
Hush-a-bye sweet lady soft and new  
Ooh don't you cry, the wind she's a-screamin' your name  
  
Come too soon that sunny day  
You give your heart away  
No divorcee, no repouise


Well I tried everything  
Just to get along with you  
And I'm gonna tell you just  
What I'm gonna do  
  
Well I'm sick of all your cryin'  
When you should be leavin' me alone  
If you don't believe me  
You pack me bags, I'm gone  
  
Won't cha please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
You almost lost your love girl  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
And you best believe I love ya baby  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Round and round


The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs  
The wrinkles on her face about to crack  
She said 'you best believe it,  
You ain't goin' nowhere, unless you get that  
Monkey off your back'  
I made believe the devil made me do it  
I was the evil leader of the pack  
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it  
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back  
If you put it a spoon man I would boot it  
Some king whose mental house was just a shack  
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dyin'  
You got to get that monkey off your back  
Uh, uh, uh....  
Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon  
She said, 'now' I bring me home his head inside a sack  
But now you find your crystal balls are draggin'  
Got to get that monkey off your back


Some like 'em short, some like 'em tall  
Some like 'em thin, skinny legs and all  
I like 'em buttered, I like 'em proud  
Now when they walk, you know they'll draw a crowd  
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me  
Whatcha say, whatcha say  
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me  
One more, gimme, gimme  
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me, hey  
Popcorn, popcorn, cheese cake, cheese cake  
Honey, I can't see ya, yeah, baby  
Listen here  
Some like 'em short, some like 'em tall  
Some like 'em thin, skinny legs and all  
I like 'em buttered, I like 'em proud  
And when they walk, you know they'll draw a crowd  
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me  
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me

That's for sure  
  
Please no more  
My fist your face  
That's for sure


My girl, she breathes hellfire  
And my girl, she feeds my desire  
My girl Sadie, she's the wind in my sails  
A puss'n boots lady with a cat o' nine tails  
Comin' after you honey, feet don't fail me now  
  
My girl, she's bare back rider  
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva  
She's a full time love no mon ami  
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee  
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
  
My girl, she smokes barbed wire  
And my girl, can't get no higher  
I made it with the lady and a one track mind  
Diamonds in the rough, they're so hard find  
Day after day, the same old grind  
And grind and grind and grind  
My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl  
  
My girl, she's bare back rider  
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva  
She's a full time love no mon ami  
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee  
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Oh, my girl!


You're a no good heartbreaker  
You're a liar and you're a cheat  
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me  
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good  
They don't know that I would leave you if I could  
I guess I'm on tight  
And I'm stuck like glue  
Cause I ain't never  
I ain't never  
I ain't never, no, no,  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
Sometimes I know I thought  
You would run out of fools  
But I was so wrong  
You got one that you'll never lose  
The way you treat me is shame  
How could you hurt me so bad  
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had  
Kiss me once again  
Don't you never never say that we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
Never  
Never no no  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me  
  
I ain't never loved a girl  
I ain't never loved a girl  
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad  
What am I gonna do about it  
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to her  
I'm gonna hold on to her


Blood stains the ivorys  
Of my Daddy's baby grand  
I ain't seen no daylight  
Since we started this band  
No More, No More  
No More, No More  
  
Store bought clothes  
Fallin' appart at the seams  
Tea leaf readin' gypsies  
Fortune tellin' my dreams  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Holiday inns, lock the door with a chain  
You love it and you hate it  
But to me they're all the same  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Baby I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage  
  
Stalemate jailbait  
Ladies can't refuse  
You love 'em then you leave 'em  
With your sold out reviews  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Sweet talkin' barroom, ladies disease  
Slippin' with her lips  
Slidin' down your knees  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Baby I'm a screamer  
Bound to a wife in marriage  
Baby, I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage  
  
Ladies hold the aces  
And their lovers call it passion  
The men call it pleasure  
But to me it's old fashioned  
  
Times they're a changin'  
Nothin' ever stands still  
If I don't stop changin'  
I'll be writin' out my will  
  
It's the same old story  
Never get a second chance  
For a dance to the top of the hill  
  
Baby I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage


Nineteen seventy one  
We all heard the starters gun  
New York is such a pity  
But at Max's Kansas City we won  
  
We all shot the shit at the bar  
With Johnny O'Toole and his scar  
And then old Clive Davis said  
I'm surely gonna make us a star  
I'm gonna make you a star  
Just the way you are  
  
But with all his style  
I could see in his eyes  
That we is goin' to trial  
  
It was no surprise  
  
The boys kept kickin' ass  
As usual time would tell  
But some bitch in the choir  
Threw water on the fires of hell  
She loved to show and tell  
Lord she loved to tell  
  
But with all our style  
You could see in our eyes  
That we is still on trial  
  
And it was no surprise  
No surprise  
No surprise  
No surprise  
  
Midnight lady  
Situation fetal  
Vaccinate your ass  
With a photograph needle  
  
I say  
Look it here  
Friend of mine  
Scratch like you need calomine  
Flamingo boots  
Sole's a creakin'  
Still in love and Puerto Rican too  
  
Ridin' on the wheels of hell  
Smokin' in our axle grease  
Oh the backstage is rockin'  
And we're coppin' from the local police  
That's right the local police  
Or the justice of peace  
  
But with all our style  
You could see in our eyes  
That we is still on trial  
  
Baby it's no surprise  
No Surprise  
No Surprise  
No Surprise  
  
Rock and roll  
Junkie whore  
Got my foot inside the door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock  
Nobody's keepin' score  
  
Bad times  
Go away  
Come again some other day  
Topaz and sazzafrazz  
Will keep the blues away  
  
Candy store  
Rock and roll  
Corporation jellyroll  
Play the singles it ain't me  
It's programmed insanity  
  
You ASCAP  
If BMI  
Could ever make a mountain fly  
If Japanese can boil teas  
Then where the fuck's my royalties


Lord I must be dreamin'  
What else could this be  
Everybody's screamin'  
Runnin' for the sea  
  
Holy lands are sinkin'  
Birds take to the sky  
The prophets all are stinkin' drunk  
I know the reason why  
  
Eyes are full of desire  
Mind is so ill at ease  
Everything is on fire  
Shit piled up to the knees  
  
Out of rhyme or reason  
Everyone's to blame  
Children of the season  
Don't be lame  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now they say  
It's nobody's fault  
  
Old San Andreas  
Seven years ago  
Shove it up their Richters  
Red lines stop and go  
  
Noblemen of courage  
Listen with their ears  
Spoke but how discouragin'  
When no one really hears  
  
One of these days you'll be sorry  
Too many houses on the stilt  
Three million years or just a story  
Four on the floor up to the hilt  
  
Out of rhyme or reason  
Everyone's to blame  
Children of the season  
Don't be lame  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now we're just a little too late  
  
Eyes are full of desire  
Mind is so ill at ease  
Everything is on fire  
Shit piled up in debris  
  
California showtime  
Five o'clock's the news  
Said everybody's concubine  
Was prone to take a snooze  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now we're just a little too late


These days are slipping away like thieves in the night  
I try to hold on to them with all my might  
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast  
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart the days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You keep our love light shinning bright  
You're my oasis in the night, yeah  
  
When you're in my arms you keep the world at bay  
You stop it at the door  
I don't care what they say  
Time's too short  
The fire's too hot  
Don't know what to do  
'Cause I know in a flash  
It's just a memory too  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart my days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
  
I think I'll die  
I just can't wait  
  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
Aah till our next oasis in the night  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night


Yeah, woke up one mornin'  
I'm a ram up for walls  
Somethin' told my baby  
You can have it all  
Jump trough the window  
Look my life in the den  
Look out pretty mama  
I'm On The Road Again  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm On The Road Again  
(And you can do what you want)  
I'm On The Road Again  
(And you can do what you want)  
Yeah, I came home last night  
To get my dinner hot  
Went to the door  
But the door was locked  
Jump through the window  
And believe me or not  
She hadn't even  
Put my dinner into the pot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, never been evil  
And I've never been shy  
Every down a champ  
And I'm a time by  
Down un winner  
With my apple in bed  
Look out pretty mama  
I'm On The Road Again  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, never been evil  
And I've never been sly  
Every down a champ  
And I'm a time by  
Down in the window  
With my apple in bed  
Look out pretty mama  
I'm On The Road Again


Been lucked out  
Broke a woman's heart  
With only myself to blame  
Fate ran it's course  
I suffered a loss  
I learned a lesso in pain  
  
Cheated, lied  
I took love for granted  
Oh, I paid the price  
I won't last a night  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
  
Love went trough such sudden change  
Taken a turn for the worst  
The joy turned to fear  
The pain got so severe  
Lord, I thought I was cursed  
  
Get what you give  
It comes around full circle  
Oh, I paid the price  
Love so fast  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough


Hey look yonder  
What's that I see  
Well that old bogus, honey  
Comin' after me  
  
I goin' told you  
Was out of town  
I wonder how she knowed  
I was hangin' around  
  
Say, listen babe  
Don't go wastin' your time  
You keep comin' 'round  
You'll hear the same old line  
  
You got a thousand boys  
You say you need 'em  
You take what's good for you  
And I'll take my freedom  
  
'Cause lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
(Heh, heh, heh)  
  
I thought I knew her  
My cagey lady  
How come my sunshine  
Was so damn shady  
She'll say she love to talk  
A conversation  
But I'm the one  
Who makes my situation  
  
This one way city  
That I thought I knew  
It's such a pity, honey  
That's it for you  
'Cause lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
  
There's nothing over here  
I never showed you  
I made it pretty clear  
I'm glad to know you  
  
You know your brother Spike  
He's on the level  
But you always lookin'  
Like you're mad at the devil  
  
Don't say I cop a 'tude  
It's all forgotten  
It's just you're much too rude  
Your fruits are rotten  
  
You know I work so hard to keep it alive  
Now all I hear from you  
Is nothing but jive  
  
Lately it's been so hard  
Now to make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I'm goin' on the other way  
Yes I do!  
  
And lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I really been feelin'  
Like I could be movin' on  
  
You're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me...  
You got to get yourself back on your feet


All the way back in a history  
How a girl thinks is a mystery  
We spend our lives cruisin' the bars  
The Venus girls and the men from mars  
So in all this time did you ever think  
Do the girl see red when the man sees pink  
And if your best lovin's in the past  
'Cuz you're somewhere slow is nowhere fast  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head  
(Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow)  
Aaar...bricka braka fiya kraka sis boom-bah  
Here's comes trouble in a push up bra  
Your style is sharp as carpet tack  
But you're out of your box and you're way off track  
You can moderate on a mental binge  
Your catastrophe's on a lunatic fringe  
It's good for the gander it's tit for tat  
You say it's all good but it's more than that  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
You're outta your head...yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
So in all this time did you ever think think think think think...  
So outta your head...yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
So outta your head...yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
Out of your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head...yeah  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
So outta your head...yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
(Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow)  
(Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow)  
(Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow)


When I'm in heat  
Someone gets a notion  
I jump to my feet  
I hoof it to the ocean  
We hit a beach  
Where no one gives a hoot  
Nobody never ever wears a suit  
The ladies there  
They look so proud  
That's 'cause they know  
That they've been so well endowed  
  
Now, I ain't much  
For Fannie's conversation  
Or care to much  
About her operation  
But every time Pandora comes my way  
I get high  
Can't explain the sensation  
To get it on  
I gotta watch what I say  
Or I'll catch hell  
From the women's liberation  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sweet Pandora  
Good-like aura  
Smell like a flora  
Open up your door-a for me  
Sweet Pandora  
Good-like aura  
Smell like a flora  
Open up your door-a for me  
Sweet Pandora  
Mama crack a smile for me  
Just for me, just for me  
Just for me, just for me  
Just for me, just for me  
Just for me  
  
Now I ain't what  
You'd call a city slicker  
Or claim to fame  
To be a slitty licker  
  
But every time Pandora comes my way  
I get high  
Can't explain the sensation  
To get it on  
I gotta watch what I say  
Or I'll catch hell  
From the women's liberation  
  
[Chorus]


I got a letter from a friend the other morning  
He say it's hot down by Montego Bay  
I got the point and now I think it's finally dawning  
Yeah, yeah, I got to get away  
I got to take myself a Permanent Vacation  
The sky's the limit, but my plane won't fly  
My nose is clean and Lordie don't need no sedation  
Yeah, yeah, and that's the reason why  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I got a sister, man she really got a pin head  
She think she kinky but she can't get straight  
She say she livin', but I kinda think she's brain dead  
Just excess baggage on a late night freight  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I gotta take me on a Permanent Vacation  
The girl's be cummin' down in Cayman Brack  
I gotta hand it to a firm situation  
Yeah, yeah, got to cut me some slack  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I really need it, really need it, really really...


Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah  
Pink, it's not even a question  
Pink, on the lips of your lover  
'Cause pink is the love you discover  
Pink, as the bing on your cherry  
Pink, 'cause you are so very  
Pink, it's the color of passion  
  
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion  
Pink, it was love at first sight  
Yeah pink, when I turn out the light  
And pink gets me high as a kite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight  
  
You could be my flamingo  
'Cause pink, it's a new kinda lingo  
Pink, like a deco umbrella  
Ffff, it's kink that you don't ever tell her  
Yeah, pink, it was love at first sight  
Then pink when I turn out the light  
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight  
  
Yeah,  
I, want to be your lover  
Ffff, I I wanna wrap you in rubber  
And it's pink as the sheets that we lay on  
'Cause pink, It's my favorite crayon  
  
Yeah  
Pink, it was love at first sight, yeah  
Pink, when I turn out the light  
Yeah pink, it's like red but not quite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight


At first we three thought  
'Twas the biblical cord of life  
Then noticing 'twas connected to his head  
  
How strange, not to believed  
I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened  
The cord got hard, the head looked around  
And you know who pushed and gushed  
The waters of life  
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur  
  
But at first to my eyes only  
Feather - feathers - wings  
The butterflies flew up in such colors  
Exploding all around us  
  
The rest I did not see - till there he stood - all eyes in wonder  
  
Who me - who you  
  
Look


[Chorus:]  
Can you be in love  
When you live alone  
Push comes to shove  
When you're bitchin' on  
  
Now look at every  
I'm tonne on you without a doubt  
Said the music does the talkin'  
But all we heard is talk about  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And the toys, yeah  
  
Rose said she was fine for two  
With blonde hair, by crack it  
Miles of blue  
Suze, she was on my side  
'Cause she and Nancy  
Ah they took me for a ride  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And they do, yeah the toys  
  
Talk about it  
Walk about it  
Talk about it  
Talkabubi  
Talk about it  
Talk about it...  
Dedumdudidudi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She looked, well, about thirty five to me  
When mine was still comin' on to you  
But I was covered back, back then  
'Cause me and the boys  
Knew hot courier  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And the toys in the attic  
  
Her sister, she was lank and thin  
Never thought I'd given in  
Her candle of youth was burnin' low  
But me and the boys  
Knew something had to go  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
Dededudidudu...  
  
Talk about it  
Walk about it  
Talk about it  
Talkabubi  
Talk about it  
Talk about it...  
Dedumdudidudi  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Huh!  
  
[Chorus]

Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery  
Rag doll, livin' in a movie  
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie  
You're so fine, they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, mam  
Hot time get it while it's easy  
Don't mind come on up and see me

Hot time get it while it's easy  
Don't mind come on up and see me  
Rag doll baby won't you do me like you done before


Goin' under, rats in the cellar  
Goin' under, skin's turnin' yellow  
Nose is runny, losin' my connection  
Losin' money, getting no affection  
  
New York City blues  
East side, West side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That you're wearing  
Tearing me apart  
  
Safe complaining, 'cause everything's rotten  
Go insanin', and ain't a thing forgotten  
Feelin' cozy, rats in the cellar  
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow  
Loose and soggy, lookin' mighty lazy  
Super party, pushin up a-daisies  
  
New York City schools  
East side, west side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That you're wearing  
Tearing me apart


Well, if you want to rock  
I got to be your rockin' horse  
If you want to roll, Lord  
I could roll you  
Right out the door, yes I could  
We'll shake the world, yeah  
When it's time to crash  
But when I get home tonight, Lord  
I guess I got to shake myself lookie here  
You need some lovin'

You fucked your mind baby

Now do the shake  
The rattlesnake shake

You need some lovin', you must have the blues  
You fucked your mind baby

Do the shake, oh  
The rattlesnake shake  
Now do the shake, yeah  
Chuck away, chuck away  
Chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck


There's a Red House over yonder  
That's where my baby stays  
There's a Red house over yonder  
That's where my baby stays  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
Seems like 99 and one half days  
Now wait a minute  
I think something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this damn door  
Now wait a minute  
I think something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this fucking door  
Something bad just because of it  
My baby don't want me no more  
That's her loss, that's my gain  
I'm gonna head out back yonder, I think  
Back yonder over the hill  
I'm gonna head out back yonder, I think  
Yonder over the hill  
Over the hill  
'Cause if my baby don't  
Love me no more  
I know her sister will


Seems like the other day,  
My baby went away,  
She went away,  
Across some sea.  
  
It's been two years or so,  
Since I saw my baby go,  
And then this letter,  
Came to me.  
  
It said ??  
She found somebody new,  
Oh, lemme think, lemme think,  
What shall I do?  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.  
Remember,  
Walking in the sand.  
Remember,  
Walking hand in hand.  
Remember,  
The night was so exciting.  
Remember,  
Her smile was so inviting,  
Remember,  
And then she touched my cheek,  
Remember,  
With her fingertips.  
Remember,  
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.  
  
Whatever happened to,  
That girl that I once knew.  
That girl that said she'd be true.  
Whatever happened to,  
That night I gave her to you.  
What will I do with it now.  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.  
Remember,  
Walking in the sand.  
Remember,  
Walking hand in hand.  
Remember,  
The night was so exciting.  
Remember,  
Her smile was so inviting,  
Remember,  
And then she touched my cheek,  
Remember,  
With her fingertip.  
Remember,  
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.  
  
Whatever happened to,  
That girl that I once knew.  
That girl that said she'd be true.  
Whatever happened to,  
That night I gave her to you.  
What will I do with it now.

I love the way my rocket purrs  
I like it best when I see blurs  
You gotta love to watch me light my fuse  
  
No more lookin' back to yesterday

All I need is you to navigate  
So come and ride my Rocket 88  
  
Call it chump change, I think not  
'Cause I got sump'n no one else has got  
It's no look like and it ain't no protege  
Its nuclear my Rocket 88  
  
Well get down on the darkside of the moon  
And leave a little somthin' on the dune  
This home by ten is gonna have to wait  
'Cause we got a Rocket 88  
  
Light years honey that's how far we'll go  
Let's fire it up and watch the rockets glow  
Gee suit, g-spot, gee I really must admit  
I got my Rocket 88, honey this is it  
  
So no more up against the wall  
Just come with me and watch the earth get small  
I swear you never will come down at all  
So if you like it in your face  
I'll rub your nose into outer space  
And turn into a red hot fireball


I want to jump but I'm afraid I'll fall  
I want to holler but the jones' too small  
Young man really got the hold to it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
Want some lovin', baby, that ain't all  
I want to kiss her but the girl's too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
I want to scream, I want you all to know  
I would be runnin' but my feets are too slow  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
Baby callin' me now hurry home  
I know she's leavin' 'cause I'm takin' too long  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the rockin' pneumonia and Joe Perry too, oh  
  
Want some lovin', baby' that ain't all  
I want to kiss her but the girl's too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
I want to scream, I want to scream  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia, what's the matter with you?


If you believe in me  
Like I believe in you  
You wouldn't be tellin' me things  
That weren't exactly true  
  
Now everything changes  
Ain't got nothing to say  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
'Cause the life I've been livin'  
And the love I've been givin'  
Will be sure to send you spinnin'  
With your feet never touching the ground  
Goin' round n' round  
  
When it was one for all  
And it was all for one  
And everything that we did  
Never bothered anyone  
  
Now everything changes  
Ain't nothing the same  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
'Cause the life I've been livin'  
And the love I've been givin'  
Will be sure to send you spinnin'  
With your feet never touching the ground  
Goin' round n' round  
  
Can you remember the days  
When you were sweet sixteen  
And always followed the ways  
Of someone else's dream  
  
(Look here)  
Now everything changes  
Ain't nothing the same  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
Goin' round n' round n' round n' round...


Get yourself cooler, lay yourself low  
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show  
When the judge's constipation go to his head  
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
  
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun  
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone  
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town  
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old story  
Same old song and dance  
  
Fate comes a-knockin', doors start lockin'  
Your old time connection, change your direction  
Ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it  
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend  
  
When you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street  
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet  
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town  
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old story  
Same old song and dance


It's deep insignus  
That knows me well  
It's all around me  
My mind can tell  
  
And all the children  
They know my name  
They scream forever  
I know the pain  
  
Oh, feel the pain  
Oh, feel the pain  
Oh, feel the pain  
Oh, feel the pain  
  
It's a sleep insignus  
That knows me well  
She's got the fever  
She's hot as hell  
  
And all the children  
They know my name  
When night is coming  
They'll scream in pain  
  
Oh, scream in pain  
Oh, scream in pain  
Oh, scream in pain  
Oh, scream in pain  
  
Yayaya...


Blues hearted lady sleepy was she,  
Love for the devil brought her to me.  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,  
Seasons of wither holdin' me in.  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you.  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you.  
In time bound to lose your mind,  
Live on borrowed time,  
Take the wind right out of your sail.  
  
Fireflies dance in the heat of,  
Hound dogs that bay at the moon.  
My ship leaves in the midnight,  
Can't say I'll be back too soon.  
  
They awaken far far away,  
Heat of my candle show me the way.  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,  
Seasons of wither holdin' me in.  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you.  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you.  
In time bound to lose your mind,  
Live on borrowed time,  
Take the wind right out of your sail.


I was a city boy  
Caught up in a city way  
A nitty gritty boy  
Was out all night  
And always gettin' blown away  
  
[Chorus]  
There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love  
  
She was a city girl  
With no responsibility  
A pretty little city girl  
All fired up and what's  
That got to do to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
Its the heat when I fall on my knees(yeah)  
That I'm thinkin' of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Its as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
It's the heat when I fall on my knees  
That I'm thinkin' of  
  
[Chorus]


Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Shame shame, shame on what you done, yeah  
  
You made me sweaty  
Talkin' I was skin and bones  
You cause your lovers grief  
Oh, look at me now  
  
Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy, that's right  
Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Shame shame, a shame on what you done  
You know what ya done  
You wanna butt  
You wanna what  
You want to, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Yeah, well I was offered dice  
I gav'em a touchin' hymn  
But then the game broke a loose  
Oh, you were the reason  
  
Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Yeah, shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Shame shame, shame on what you done, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
And now you're talkin' back  
Well I can tell your plan  
You oughta eat my words down on your knees  
  
Shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, shame shame shame on you Miss Roxy  
Shame shame, a shame on what you done, well  
  
Shame shame a shame on you Miss Roxy

Shame on what you done, yeah  
Shame shame, shame on what you done, who yeah who yeah, yeah


Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Hot to trot, she's a bit insane  
Little bit a pleasure  
With a little bit a pain  
I got to be smokin'  
So I know without a doubt  
Where there's smoke there's fire  
So I gotta boot it out  
Say oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Homely child with a hang down lip  
Starved for love and companionship  
Little by little, catchin' up to me  
She's more of a woman  
Then I thought she'd be to me...yeah  
Hungry girl, she's the skinniest thing  
She's sayin' the word, I'm losin' sting ?  
She's on fire  
She hung my head in a guillotine  
She's my flame, she's a wettin' my dream  
She's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire


Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance  
Love has got me down  
The weight is all around  
So you lend a hand to peace on earth  
Here's my piece, now what's it worth  
Yea, but it's all right  
When you can't define the crime  
Then life ain't worth a dime  
When they take away everything you got  
And they rub your nose in the funky spot  
Not without a fight  
When you work your fingers to the bone  
And what does that get you--nothing  
If in a crowd of people  
You're still alone I hope that tells you something  
The road to heaven is paved in hell  
And it makes you wonder  
Why you're here at all  
Check out the shape of your circumstance  
He wears the dress and she wears the pants  
Here comes Jill and she needs romance  
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!  
Sex is like a gun  
You aim, you shoot, you run  
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean  
It' like gettin' head from a guillotine  
And the night has just begun  
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance


Please, I just got to talk to you  
Please, well keep your head out of the loo  
Please, we're a long, long way from home  
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sick as a dog, what's your story  
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue  
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry  
Sick as a dog, 'cause you're really ain't that young  
  
Please, you were much to my surprise  
Please, you're a lady in disguise  
Please, you're the only friend I got  
Please, you're the last to see me rot  
  
Please, it's a shame you're so refined  
Please, she was the last thing on my mind  
Please, don't be late to take it light  
Please, you're gonna bay into the night  
  
Say goodnight


Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down  
'neath the city, eatin' ground round  
Underground is pretty gritty  
I turned the screw she held the light  
That's when I knew she was a  
  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
  
Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs  
Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
I turned the screw, she held the knife  
  
Oh, holy jesus, she's a sight for sore eyes  
Sight for sore eyes  
She's a nitty grutty  
  
Turnin' in style, walk a mile for your titty  
Naked foul while under there  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
Hey, don't you know people  
She's a love lust hussy  
She left, oh she rust me  
Dear old girl  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
But she was sittin' pretty  
A sight for sore eyes  
She was a nitty gritty  
Sight for sore eyes  
  
Peeled back and parted  
Even at the start it was delight or demise  
I feel like a leopard king  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes


I need a lady, not somebody shady  
Need someone to be close to  
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosey  
Help me see my whole day through  
  
Someone to share the load  
Somebody to walk the road I live on, live  
  
Good Lord send me, good Lord mend me  
Send me down someone for me  
Said I won't be choosy  
You could send me a floosy  
Send me anybody you please  
Somebody say you will  
Somebody further still  
Somebody, some, somebody for me  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Yeah, somebody  
  
Won't you send me somebody  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Well, call for somebody  
Scream loud and bloody  
Call woman, woman, come on to me  
Save for tomorrow  
Share all your sorrow  
Misery enjoys company  
Yes it does, yes it does


You're making me wait like there's no tomorrow  
You're taking from me what I can't beg or borrow  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more  
  
You know there was dreams I had in my corner  
I made you a dollar, you gave a quarter  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more


Cyberotic head explode  
Information overload  
And I just can't take anymore  
And I'm gonna break  
Something's gotta give  
Tell me when to turn the screw  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Comic books are comin' true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Digerotic mass appeal  
Feels like flesh but tastes unreal  
And I'm gonna break  
Something's gotta give  
Tell me when to turn the screw  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Don't you like it  
Tell me true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Hold your breath 'til you turn blue  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Comic books are comin' true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
If love that seemed to fall from grace  
Was sitting on your interface  
Your megahertz she can't forgive  
Your love it died before you ever lived  
Something's gotta give  
Tell me when to turn the screw  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Don't you like it  
Tell me true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Hold your breath til you turn blue  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Comic books are comin' true  
Does the noise in my head bother you


Spaced in time child of nine  
Doin' twenty years on the way  
Fire and steel earth unreal  
Find another planet to stay  
Papa died ma survived  
Tellin' me about her ordeal  
And the soul she could not feel  
'Cause they made her so unreal  
Lightnin' years disappears  
Twenty million years on my brain  
Synthesize overrides  
Tryin' to keep from goin' insane  
And my soul I can not feel  
'Cause they made me so unreal  
Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothin' out there  
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care  
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losin' my mind  
And I'm never never never never ever goin' back  
I'm off the track no one even knows I'm alive  
Spaced without a trace  
Waitin' for the word to arrive  
I'm the last man to survive


Spiderman, spiderman  
Does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web, any size  
Catches thieves just like flies  
  
Look out here comes the spiderman  
  
Is he strong, listen bud  
He's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing, from a thread  
No escape from his spider-web  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out, life is a great big bang-up  
Wherever there is a hang-up  
You'll find the spiderman.

Late at night when he praised the Lord  
He lay his hands down upon the bloody sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Down, down upon the sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Gettin' down upon the sword  
Laid down upon the sword  
Laid it down upon the sword

I sold my soul for a one night stand  
I followed Alice into Wonderland  
I ate the mushroom and I danced with the queen  
Yeah we danced in between all the lines  
I followed daylight right into the dark  
Took to the Hatter like a walk in the park  
But then I met her yeah she felt so right  
No child of the night yeah was she  
They called her sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
Sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah

Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta love the sweet taste of India  
Blame it on the beat of the drum

Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
Yeah, she's got that kind of love incense  
That lives in her back room  
And when it mixes with the funk my friend  
It turns into perfume  
  
When you are born  
You're afraid of the darkness  
Then you're afraid of the light  
But I'm not afraid  
When I dance with my shadow  
  
This time I'm gonna get it right  
To think of what I'll get tonight  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
Her Yin and Yang  
Is just the thing  
She's unpredictable my friend  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
It's like your first taste, love, of vindaloo  
That sets your heart on fire  
And if you let her stuff get into you  
It will be all that you desire  
  
When you make love to  
A sweet tantric priestess  
You drink in the bliss of delight  
But I'm not afraid  
When I dance with her shadow  
  
This time I'm gonna get it right  
She's gonna wake my appetite  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
She a friend of mine  
She a concubine  
The sweetest wine  
I gotta make her mine  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta love the sweet taste of India  
Blame it on the beat of the drum  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
Just think of what I'll get tonight  
She's gonna wake my appetite  
Just lookin' for a little taste

I never thought a first time love would ever last  
How could a kiss like that  
Knock me flat on my ass  
  
The burning bed  
The roses dead  
And now I'm dancing with myself  
  
Yeah,

Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of my mind

Kiss butt, and guess what  
Even double crossin' dogs have their day, ha

Yeah, I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off  
  
And the more I try  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me slip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of the cloud we was on  
And now it's all gone  
Tell me why, why, why, why  
Why ain't I getting through  
Ain't no lie there out of love, love, love  
  
Tell me was it good, for you

Get your sweet ass off the floor  
Doctor, doctor, doctor

I scream your name into the crowd  
You feel the flame but you ain't proud  
Maybe your attitude ain't right  
So all that's left for me to do is bite  
The hand that feeds me  
Feeds me  
  
Doctor, doctor, doctor  
Doctor, doctor, please  
  
All things you put me through  
What the hell you want me to  
Do all the things that uncle John needs

In the middle of, with a spittle of  
Et tu like birds of a feather  
When another day, love another way

In the ladies powder room

A Hardly man himself is hard to shake his rattle snake

You keep knockin' but you can't come in  
The way you love I adore  
You always come never know where you been  
But a-now I'm here baby to even the score  
  
You're up, you're down  
You're always running in place  
Triathlon if you please  
You're always beggin' me for a taste  
But I ain't up to snuff if you sneeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me the bends  
Heads and tails  
You're all out of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Like the reason a dog  
Has so many friends  
He wags his tail instead of his tongue  
  
Your older sister  
She's a lot like you  
She likes to grab my microphone  
Now there ain't too much she won't do  
Especially when we're all alone  
  
You're up, you're down  
You're always runnin' in place  
Triathlon if you please  
Her mind's on rewind and erase  
You might get shot, babe  
When you're shootin' the breeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me bends  
You're heads and tails  
Are calling for love  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Your older sister  
She's a lot like you  
And there ain't too much she won't do  
  
There's always something  
That you got to say  
I lose my mind and then I surely fade away, yeah  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me the bends  
You're heads and tails  
Now look what you done  
  
[Chorus x2]


When will the clouds all blow it away  
When will the good people have their say  
Now I hope you're still around to see the day  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a while, think about it  
Take a while, think about it  
Take a while, think about it  
  
Who's gonna tell what is up or down  
Who can be the king or be the clown  
Then climb your tree, take a look around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take it nobody out, if it in the tame  
That which is now, will be again  
Who can decide who is insane  
  
[Chorus]


This Little Light of Mine (Light of Mine),  
I'm Let it shine (Aleilujah),  
This Little Light of Mine, I'm gonna let it shine,  
  
Down in my heart (In my heart),  
I'm gonna let it shine (Aleilujah)  
Down in my heart (In My heart)  
I'm gonna let it, let it shine.  
  
All over the world (All over the world),  
I'm gonna let it shine (Let it shine, let it shine let it shine)  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine


Take a walk in the warm New England sun  
Ain't no time to look for clues  
You get the point from Uncle Sam's loaded gun  
Who be the hand that light the fuse, ah  
  
Take a look, take a look at my old billy goat  
He used to raise all kinds of hell  
He took a dose of radiation dope  
Back in the barn is where he fell, like hell  
  
Lucy, chromosone  
Lucy, superdome  
  
What makes you think you patronizin' my old friends  
After you ride in my car, car  
What do you do when your oil's mexican  
OPEC boys, you went too far, to faar  
  
Lucy, chromosone

You gotta find a way  
Yeah, I can't wait another day  
Ain't nothin' gonna change  
If we stay around here  
I gotta do what it takes  
Because it's all in our hands  
We all make mistakes  
Yeah, but it's never to late to start again (yeah yeah)  
Take another breath  
And say another prayer  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere  
Yeah, I don't care  
If we just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Won't let time pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
If this life  
Gets any harder now  
It ain't no nevermind  
Ya got me by your side  
And anytime you want (fly fly fly)  
Yeah we catch a train  
And find a better place  
Yeah, 'cause we won't let nothin'  
Or no one keep gettin' us down  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and hit the sky  
  
Then fly away from  
To anywhere  
Yeah, I don't care  
If we just fly away from here  
And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
I won't let time pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
Do you see a bluer sky now  
You could have a better ride now  
Open your eyes  
  
Because no one here can ever stop us  
They can try but we won't let them  
No way-ay-ay-ay-yeah-ah  
  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere  
No honey I don't care  
If we just fly away from here  
And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Fly away from here (ya ya ya)  
Yeah anywhere  
Now honey, I don't I don't I don't fly (yeah)  
  
We just fly (fly away)


In the attic lights  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
[Chorus:]  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
  
Lights  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream

Well, on a train, I met a dame,  
She rather handsome, we kind looked the same  
She was pretty, from New York City  
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane,  
I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her so  
I said, train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
With a "heave!", and a "ho!"  
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no  
Well, get along, sweet little woman get along  
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along  
On your way,  
I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

On your way,  
I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her  
Well, we made a stop in Albuquerque  
She must'a thought I was a real cool jerk  
Got off the train, and put her hands up  
Lookin' so good I couldn't let her go  
But I just couldn't tell her so  
I said, train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her


Yeeeah...  
Yak goa goa...  
I got a wild thing for you  
We're talkin' hoops you got me jumpin' thru  
You got those lemon drop martini eyes  
And if my karma suits you  
Cross the line into another place and time  
Tell me how pretty she is  
When she turns the colors of the rainbow  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'... yeah  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Ain't no smokin' fantasy  
'Cuz lovin' you is trippin' to me  
You got me psychodelisized  
You got my situation bone-a-fide  
It took a sunset to get me to see  
That all I really needed was your love  
To yeah forever shine on me  
Promise promiscuity is like waiting for your ex-to-see that  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'... yeah  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Get my way with you...trip hoppin'  
In my kaleidoscope I'm lookin' thru  
My only color was a neon blue  
I was hangin' on to yesterday  
And now the only way out is thru  
One more night with you  
(One more night with you)  
One more day won't do  
(One more day won't do)  
Yeah  
How beyond the rainbow is my  
Laying on your emerald pillow  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Yeah...yeah  
Ain't no smokin' fantasy  
'Cuz lovin' you is trippin' to me

One more night with you  
One more day


Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely  
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead  
My mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted  
They left her to be trusted till the orphan bleeds  
But when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby  
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see  
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others  
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead  
But when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh, oh yeah  
Oooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah  
  
Now she's doin' any for money and a penny  
A sailor with a penny or two or three  
Hers is the cunning for men who come a-runnin'  
They all come for fun and it seems to me  
That when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window [Repeat to fade]


You breathe... I breathe you in

That's it's open broken hearted season

Why did you take it all away  
Voodoo, Voodoo, Medicine Man...  


Yeah yeah  
  
You wonder why you got holes in your shoes  
You wonder why they got more money than you  
You wonder why you got nothin' to lose  
It makes no sense, don't try to figure it out  
You gotta walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down

Well, she says that she loves ya  
In your mind there's no doubt, but  
You feel like a stranger  
When the lights go out  
As you lie there awake  
You think this ain't no gift  
Don't try to figure that weight's too heavy to lift  
You gotta walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
Walk on down

Put on my walkin' shoes

High class  
Moolah  
Bolt ons  
Fast car  
Quick fix  
Freak out  
Nose bleed  
Skull cap  
Pissed off  
Pissed on  
  
I never seen a smile that looked so sad  
You make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey little darlin'  
Your love is legendary  
Love's four letters  
Ain't in my dictionary  
'Scuse my position  
But it ain't missionary  
Yeah but I want to  
Walk on the water with you  
  
Boo-tay  
Hotpants  
Tan line  
Sweet stuff  
Hookah  
Boo yah  
Knocked Up  
Hose Down  
Cool cat  
Hot flash  
  
When it comes to makin' love I ain't no hype  
'Cause I practise on a peach most every night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, the cook's in the kitchen  
And hidin' the spoons  
I'm winkin' at witches  
And howlin' at moons  
I'm afraid of the candle  
But Live for the flame  
You know who I am  
But you don't know my name  
  
(Aha, ha, ha, ha)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey little darlin'  
Your love is legendary  
You got the boo yah  
It's almost ficitonary  
'Scuse my position  
But it ain't missionary  
Yeah, but I want to  
Walk on the water with you


For certain she was the face of springtime,  
The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
Just a little bit more.


I'm just a wandering gypsy  
I'll sing for you tonight  
And when the seats are empty  
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight  
And I'll be in the place where I belong  
  
For who will tell the story  
Except someone like me  
Of tragedy and glory  
Of lovers as they walk so blindly  
And try to find a place where they belong  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
Everybody knows me  
Everone shows me  
And I'll be here when you have gone  
For the road to carry on  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
If destiny has spoken  
If finally the dawn has broken  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
I'm just a wandering gypsy  
I've sung for you tonight  
And now the seats are empty  
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight  
And I'll be in the place where I belong


Night-  
And the world is fast asleep  
I will hold you here and keep  
All our secret dreams and plans  
  
You-  
Never thought our love could last  
Now you've put that in the past  
Cause you finally understand  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all  
  
We-  
All the promises we made  
All the words we never said  
Never knowing what was right  
  
You didn't know-  
That the love we used to share  
Wasn't cause it wasn't there  
We'll make up for it tonight  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all  
  
We were young  
And your dreams took you places far from me  
I was wrong  
To believe  
That you'd go  
Cause here you are  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all


Hit with the bug to run, you didn't go to college we can use you son  
You look like the pride of your home town  
But how can you hold out when your luck is down  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame.  
Because I'm too tired to run around  
Meeting people from the wrong side of town  
Looking for a place to live, I've got no money nothing to give, listen  
All you gotta do is look around for something that's new  
find a job that's stimulating, that's easy and I'm still waiting  
  
(Chorus)  
I've stood in line and done my time  
With nothin' to do all day  
I've stood in line with all my friends  
With nothin' to say all day,  
I've stood in line and done my time  
With nothin' to do all day  
I've stood in line with all my friends  
With nothin' to say all day, nothin' to say all day.  
Got brains but got no drive  
Money's cheap, the roads are wide  
All the good positions go too fast  
I need a job I know will last  
I've got a job for you can you push that shovel can you swing that broom  
Keep your head down and don't go slow  
But don't forget to stop with the whistle.  
(Chorus


When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
Livin' alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
But when I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
Hard to be sure  
Sometimes I feel so insecure  
And love's so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore


I'm lying alone with my head on the phone  
Thinking of you till it hurts  
I know you hurt too but what else can we do  
Tormented and torn apart  
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart  
For times when my life feels so low  
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring  
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too  
Does the feeling seem oh so right  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I can't hold on  
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day  
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, what are you thinking of?  
What are you thinking of?  
Oh, what are you thinking of?  
What are you thinking of?  
  
[Chorus x3]


There's got to be an alternate ending.  
There's got to be an easy way out.  
I've got to make a change to the messages I'm sending.  
It's all gone wrong, give me time.  
It's all my fault, could have told you.  
Before it's gone too far.  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
  
There's got to be an alternate ending.  
There's got be an easy way out.  
I've got to be the one to say I'm sorry for pretending.  
It's all gone wrong, will you wait?  
It's all my fault, will you listen... to me?  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
Stay with me awhile, all that we've done together.  
I've got no rights and I've got no style, but love is blind.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
Stay with me awhile, all that we've done together.  
I've got no rights and I've got no style, but love is blind.  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.


I can see hills touch the sky  
Heaven and earth, you and I  
A world we will always be  
Here in the silence we lie  
Shadows we cast, you and I  
Speak for eternity  
  
[Chorus]  
Pressed between pages  
Flowers will die  
Stories may end as time passes by  
You and I will always be  
  
With every word that I hear  
Whenever whispers are near  
I can believe in fate  
Promises made, only one  
  
Yesterday fades from the sun  
And falls to a new embrace  
Years overflow  
As rivers run dry  
  
Here in a moment of time passing by  
You and I will always be, will always be  
  
[Chorus]


They were married in September back in 1969  
They travelled, these two Indians,  
To find some peace of mind  
They stood for love and freedom  
They were children of their time oh oh  
  
They lived in a world that was cold and uncaring  
They swore they would change it  
with loving and shareing  
They'll never live like their parents have done  
Their innocence shone like the sun  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Now they've got a family and a cottage in the hills  
He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills  
And she has trouble sleeping  
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh  
  
Who are these strangers who used to be lovers  
Now they've got nothing to say to each other  
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes  
They filed for divorce and it breaks their  
  
American hearts, so fiIled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Ah - American hearts  
Ah - American hearts, American hearts  
  
Now that it's over they'll each go on living  
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving  
They'll care for their children protect them with pride  
And that's how their dream will survive in  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken

I'm going back just a few years  
All people used to seem tall  
When everyday would be voices calling  
I'd take no notice at all  
I'd take no notice at all  
Then when I asked if you'd  
Held conversation  
I was the talk of the town  
Until the voice let me see in the future  
They didn't look so way down  
  
I have to make them listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make them listen now  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
And so I heard and I saw  
Something happening  
They were just like you and me  
But they were wiser and all had the message  
We really had to believe  
We really had to believe  
  
They showed me how the world keeps on turning  
It's not as hard as it seems  
So many secrets you wouldn't believe in  
They manufacture our dreams  
  
I have to make you listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make you listen now  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
I was afraid of things that I can't see  
I can't see love but I like it a lot  
I used to take a life in the back seat  
Until the front row began to move off  
There must be more to sleep than waking  
I was so sure there was something waiting  
There  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural

Believer  
I got no where to go  
Believer  
The only one I know  
Between us I'm the stranger  
Who never does the things that people do  
I let it through  
  
  
Believer  
We always seem to shine  
Believer  
You're always reaching high  
  
  
And I'm just drifting  
You understand the problems passing through  
I'm still with you  
It's like a storybook romance  
Everything is so right with the prince in the trees  
Waiting underneath the window for you  
Any moment he'll sing you a melody  
When you're hard and start a life on your own  
If you always knew the ending had to come true  
  
  
Believer  
I've got a troubled mind  
Believer  
We've got to break it down  
Somewhere inside is a weakness  
That wants to be discovered  
Just like you  
I'll help you too  
  
  
It's like reading a storybook romance  
Everything is so right with the prince in the trees  
Waiting underneath the window for you  
Any moment he'll sing you a melody  
When your hard and start a life on your own  
If you always knew the ending had to come true  
  
  
Believer  
We always seem to shine  
Believer  
You're always reaching high  
  
  
And if you're just drifting  
You understand the problems passing through  
I'm still with you  
Believer  
Believer  
Believer...


Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat talking on the wild side  
He knows he looks the way he should  
He's got something making him feel good  
He's got the style, he's got the sway  
He's a million miles away  
  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
She don't smile, she don't look  
She don't do laundry and she don't cook  
She's not listening to what he says  
She's not making any promises  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone  
  
Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat stalking on the wild side  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
He's thinking how she's not so tough  
Could be a diamond sitting in the rough  
She's staring out to empty space  
She's wondering how long he will take  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone  
  


Blue, blue is the color of skies  
Blue is the color of your eyes  
Your beautiful blue eyes  
Black, black is the color you wore  
Black is the promise you made before you closed  
the door  
And never told me why  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
You, you used to sleep by my side  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And now there's nothing left to lose  
  
Night, night after long endless night  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And I was so naive to believe your lies  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Down in the depths of your soul  
I hear the echo and the sigh that your secrets  
can not hide  
They never lie to me  
  
Night, night after long endless night  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And I was so naive to believe your lies  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Broken in two because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away having me all black and blue.


The more you win, the more you gain  
An open window to the human brain  
The more you give, the more you lose  
You can't go dancing in these mountain shoes  
And that won't do.  
The more you touch, the more you feel  
It's just a picture that you thought was real  
The less you need, the more you know  
You can say the prophet told you so  
Do do dooo  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove.  
VERSE 2  
The world is just potato chips  
Joined together at the female hips  
The Universe we left behind  
We never know what we are going to find.  
Do do dooo  
And when we want to be alone  
To get away, baby, to another zone  
The word is out, the clothes are in  
And who knows maybe it's another sin  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The more you win, the more you gain  
An open window to the human brain  
The more you touch, the more you feel  
It's just a picture that you thought was real  
You thought was real  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
  


The book of love, that sacred place  
Where we walk tall, or in disgrace  
Who tills the ground on which we tread  
Who gives us all our daily bread  
The spirit woken from its sleep  
The demon stirring from the deep  
Whose gates at dawn we all must pass  
The last one first, the first one last  
Whose words must be both black and white  
Whose music shall be day and night  
The moon that tells us of the sun  
Where voices soar so far above  
These pages are the book of love  
  
If we were born just to succeed  
If life was meant to be a choice  
For either happiness or greed  
If you can't walk, you'll always run  
Away from anyone, yes you will  
  
But if we learn to take our time  
As though each moment is a treasure  
That's not so hard to find  
When you are free, then suddenly  
There's room for everyone, yes there is  
  
CHORUS  
The book of love, the world of dreams  
Those shadows fall upon us all  
And send our weary eyes to sleep  
But when you wake, your heart will make  
Some room for everyone  
  
Just come to me  
There's nothing you should fear  
Just come to me  
I'll always be right here  
I tell you now  
Your heart is where I live  
And what you ask, is what I'll give  
  
If we were born just to succeed  
If life was meant to be a choice  
For either happiness or greed  
If you can't walk, you always run  
Away from anyone, yes you will  
  
But if we learn to take our time  
As though each moment is a treasure  
That's not so hard to find  
When you are free, then suddenly  
There's room for everyone, yes there is  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  


I'm not afraid of losing you or saying good-bye  
If someone needs you more than me, I will understand why  
I'd never stand between someone who's holding your heart  
But I can't let a superstition tear us apart  
Who has the right to speak fire from above  
If heaven is away from you, that is the place I will give up  
For falling in love can't be taking these lips from the cup  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I'm not afraid to face the truth of what I believe  
If love was never meant to choose, it could never succeed  
And we may always stand alone in everyone's sight  
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  
Who puts a price on eternity's sin  
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again  
For you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I won't see you cry, should it make you cry  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood


When all else fails and you have nothing  
You know you really should believe in something  
Take a look at what you have  
To a dream that's not all that bad  
Don't waste time with all your thinking  
Wake up now your dreams are sinking  
Making the change is up to you  
You'll accept nothing less than the best  
  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
  
It's much quicker than the eye  
It's you mind and it's there all the time  
Say goodbye this is tomorrow  
Make your mind up not to follow  
You can lead yourself away Understand You can have what you say  
  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
  
You can stay with me now  
And tell me what you know  
You can stay with me now  
And tell me all you know  
  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
  


I can't fight this feeling any longer  
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow  
What started out as friendship has grown stronger  
I only wish I had the strength to let it show  
  
I tell myself, that I can't hold out forever  
I say there is no reason for my fear  
Cause I feel so secure when we're together  
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear  
  
And even as I wonder I'm keeping you in sight  
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars forever  
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through your door  
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore  
  
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you  
I've been running around in circles in my mind  
Baby it always seems that I'm following you  
Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find  
And even as I wonder I'm keeping you sight  
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars forever  
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through your door  
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore


If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
  
Here we are, how did we come so far  
Just tell me how you are, I need to know  
Night has come to see the senses run  
And every single one, we all must show  
  
And when you feel the flood upon the waters edge  
And take the leap from bitter sweet  
Do you believe, do you believe  
Do you still believe  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
  
In the sea of those eyes, in the fall of the rise  
There is no compromise  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Won't you come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
Won't you come to me  
  


When she looks at me  
I know the girl sees things  
Nobody else can see  
  
All of the secret fears inside  
And all the craziness I hide  
She looks into my soul  
And reads me like nobody can  
  
And she doesn't judge the man  
She just takes me as I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Come what may, she believes  
And that faith is something  
I've never known before  
Come what may, she loves me  
And that love has helped me open a door  
Making me love myself a little more  
  
When I turn away  
She knows those are the times  
There's nothing she can say  
  
Nothing that anyone can do  
And so she lets me live it through  
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty  
She just simply lets me be  
And goes right on loving me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
And when it seems my dreams  
Have all slipped through my fingers  
When they just can't be found  
I turn around and there they are  
Shining in her eyes


When you are young, the thought of the day is  
Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules.  
You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that  
Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last.  
And you smile as it's going past.  
Each morning arrives, and so much is new  
You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you.  
The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night  
You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love  
  
You live every day, as fast as it comes  
And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.  
These times will change, and people must grow but  
Until you do, you live the only life that you know  
And the wild fire lets you go.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,  
Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew  
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love


Hot sun as warm as the kissing of the wind  
Fooststeps in perfect time  
Heartbeat as loud as the whisper in the wood  
Hold me this dance is mine  
The dance is mine  
  
We are alone, your love excites me  
You are the earth moving inside me  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  
We climb up into the shelter of the sky  
Footsteps on higher ground  
Your voice as soft as a river running dry  
Hold me this dance is mine  
  
We are alone, your love's exciting me  
You are the earth, moving inside me  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  


Daybreak, I can't hide the truth  
It seems I'm not so strong  
And suddenly, there's no more to lose  
So where did I go wrong  
I should have known before  
Her love for me was gone  
  
Now I'm waiting for the light  
To fill this empty room  
I need you now to break through the night  
Whose shadows came too soon  
I waited far too long and now  
I feel I can't go on  
  
CHORUS  
Daybreak, oh daybreak  
I let her walk away  
I should have said, don't go  
I know I should have found another way  
Now I don't know what to do  
So daybreak, please break through  
  
Daybreak, I feel so alone  
Why won't you come to stay  
  
I waited far too long and now  
I feel I can't go on  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  


I used to watch you walk away  
Til the road you take would bend  
I was the man to turn you on  
And you knew it after all  
Come tomorrow when I'm all weary  
You would turn me down again  
At least that's the way I can remember  
  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
  
Every little word you told me got home  
I'm still thinking about them  
Every little secret we could have known  
And we can't live without them  
  
You surely started something  
You surely gave me something new  
  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
  
And I do think about you each now and then  
And each time it gets tighter  
From the road I can see the last break  
And my head's getting lighter  
  
Do it again, do it again (repeat)  


Do what you do cause you do it so well  
So stand in my way  
If only I knew what these eyes could not tell  
What this mouth could not say  
People are wrong but I'm right this time  
I'm losing bad friends fast  
Do what you do and keep it that way  
And this love will last  
  
Do what you do when your lights are turned down  
And you wake up afraid  
Think of the love that I have here for you  
And the wish will be made  
Only a cut of the deepest kind  
Could break what I hold for you  
I know the cut will never be mine  
So do what you do  
  
Waiting to put a foot in the door  
Hoping to learn what you're never sure  
Don't look too far it's here where you are  
  
Only a cut of the deepest kind  
Could break what I hold for you  
I know the cut will never be mine  
So do what you do


Does it matter if you're not sure  
You're never gonna see him anymore  
He's gone for good  
You might get mad at yourself  
You're doing your very best  
You can't do nothing else baby  
You've done the best you can  
There's been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still don't say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
I'm giving you just one more chance  
To recompense on my romance  
Can't believe there's been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still don't say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
  
I'm gonna stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
Stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
  
(Repeat)


When winter calls and the wind won't wait  
Look through the rain see the leaves start to break  
Once so alone like a prayer on the sea  
Nothing to hide, so much there to see  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
The thoughts you wear like a long lost friend  
Are buried so deep that you can't see them end  
You know spring will come just as quick as you need  
And run straight to you when the dark nights are freed  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  


You were late last night, the candle burned so low  
And in my darkest hour I knew you had to go  
Did he hold you like I held you once before  
Is there someone else that loves you even more  
Don't tell me  
  
Standing face to face the words just fall away  
But in my loneliness I knew just what to say  
Did he touch you where I touched you long ago  
Please don't answer, I don't really want to know  
  
So don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
  
I have no more to give you  
I have no room to share  
I know the road I follow going nowhere  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
  
Should I close my eyes and say I'm giving up  
Can we compromise the darker side of love  
Did he hold you like I held you once before  
Since I lost your love I need you even more  
Don't tell me lies  
  
I have no more to give you  
I have no room to share  
I know the road I follow going nowhere  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me


We shared such a special love, it seem to have no end, but now it hurts me
just to remember,your eyes use to tell me so much..that words could never
find, and now you say, you don't know where your future lies but you got to
find it now or get left behind, don't turn me away I can't forget it all in
just one day take some time to speak your mind but say it's not over, don't
turn me away don't close the door on us this way I'm so sure that there's much
more you just have to tell me, remember those fights at nights it's not that
long ago, you said you wanted to stay there forever, I gave you the strength
of my hand when things were running low, I didn't know you would go back on
what you said, there must be some reasons there that you don't want to
share..don't turn me away, I can't forget it all in just one day take some
time to speak your mind but say it's not over...don't turn me away don't close
the door on us this way I'm so sure that there's much more you just have to
tell me...and just when you needed me, said I'd be there until the end, what
is it that's changed in you when all I want is to be your friend..I need a
friend...Don't turn me away...Don't turn me...Don't turn me away....Don't turn
me away...Don't turn me....Don't turn me away...Don't turn me away...Don't
turn me...Don't turn me away...Don't turn me...Don't turn me away...Don't turn
me away, take some time to speak your mind, but say it's not over..Don't turn
me awayy...takes some time to speak your mind, but say it's not over..Don't
turn me away,takes some time to speak your mind but say it's not overrrr!!


Why do I say, don't walk away  
You'll be the way you were before, when you don't want me anymore  
  
  
Don't turn around, don't ever leave, a lonely room where empty days  
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone, gone  
How in the world will I go on  
  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay (don't walk away)  
  
  
Chorus:  
Don't walk away (don't walk away), don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)  
Don't turn around (don't turn around), don't let it die (don't let it die)  
When shadows fall (when shadows fall), when day is done (when day is done)  
All through the night (all through the night), all of my life (all of my life)  
Don't walk away  
  
  
Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known has ended and I'm all alone  
  
  
Where will I go, where will I be, the feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone, gone  
How in the world will I go on  
  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay (don't walk away)  
  
  
Chorus repeats 3x


When you're out in front and your life is unsure  
What have you got goin' for you after every road you turn  
It's magic when you tell me and run your fingers through my hair  
I don't need your persuasion, 'cause I'm already there  
I've just read it through and I said to myself  
That's not really you, I'll keep myself to myself  
It's magic when you tell me, and write the words I want to see  
When I reach the last line, it's just empty for me  
I've been learning so long, about the things you do  
I've been learning so long about you, about you  
  
[Chorus]  
Empty pages I've read you all through  
Empty pages filled with spaces I fell in and I fell in  
Empty pages I've read you all through  
Empty pages filled with spaces I fell in and I fell in.


This will take some understanding  
I believe someone is sending love to us and everyone  
Who cares to take a gamble sometimes  
Think of me I've given all I can  
Stretched an arm and open hand to you  
  
So never say no  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
  
You I need, always needed, don't turn back for any reason  
First we talk and then we fall headfirst into each others thinking  
Please be where I'll always see you, life is short  
The twinkle of an eye is all we have until we say  
  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
  
Take me away, take me away  
Take me away  
Do you dream fantasy and believe what you see is weird  
I need a remedy or a book to get off this fear  
All I wanted to know is how do I get the truth from here.  
We play so small a part  
But we started from somewhere  
  
All the friends that I can think of  
Know what's going to happen to them  
If they don't think on today and plan ahead for their tomorrow  
Here we are just lucky children breaking out of the shell  
I'll take your hand today and love you till we reach  
  
The end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Take me away  
Take me away  
Take me away  
  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line


I, I was the lonely one  
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone  
And left me lonely  
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used  
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me  
  
I used to think I was tied to a heartache  
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you  
  
Even the nights are better  
Now that we're here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you, oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you love's beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you  
  
You, you knew just what to do  
'Cause you had been lonely too  
And you showed me how  
To ease the pain and  
You did more than mend a broken heart  
'Cause now you've made a fire start  
And I, I can see that you feel the same way  
  
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me  
Until you told me and now that I've found you  
Even the nights are better  
Now that we're here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you, oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you love's beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you  
  
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me  
Until you told me and now that I've found you  
  
Even the nights are better  
Now that we're here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you, oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you love's beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you


Every night seems, dinner and wine  
Saturdays, girls  
I was never in love, never had the time  
In my hustle and hurried world  
Laughing my self to sleep, waking up lonely  
I need someone to hold me, oh  
  
It's such a crazy home town  
It can drag you down  
Till you run out of dreams  
So you party all night to the music and lights  
But you don't what happiness means  
I was dancing in the dark with strangers  
No love around me  
When suddenly you found me, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl  
  
Everything good, everything fine  
That's what you are  
So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb  
As high as the highest star  
I'm living the life time in every minute  
That we're together  
And I'm staying right here forever, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl


When I look for the love in your eyes  
You turn away  
And there's nothing as loud as the words  
That we never say  
Look at us now  
Standing on the edge again  
It's not too late to try again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Evidence of love  
To keep on going  
Show me some evidence of love  
And I'll be here  
I still believe we can see this through  
There's only so much I can do  
And it doesn't make sense  
Without some evidence of love  
  
There's a frozen look on your face  
Is it saying goodbye  
'Cause there's nothing as cold as the ashes  
When the fire has died  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stand and fight  
Gotta say what's on your mind, baby  
So much is on the line  
Here's a chance to make it right  
  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus]


You made a fool of me, but them broken dreams have got to end.  
  
Hey woman, you got the blues, cos' you ain't got no one else to use.  
There's an open road that leads nowhere, so just make some miles between here
and there.  
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in,  
You took my body and played to win,  
Ha Ha woman it's a crying shame,  
But you ain't got no one else to blame.  
  
Chorus:  
E-evil Woman, E-evil Woman, E-evil Woman, Evil Woman  
  
Rolled in from another town,  
Hit some gold too hot to settle down,  
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways,  
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze,  
Ha Ha woman what you gonna do,  
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you,  
It's so good that you're feeling pain,  
But you better get yourself on board the very next train.  
  
Chorus  
  
Evil woman how you done me wrong,  
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song,  
Ha Ha funny how you broke me up, you made the wine now you drink the cup,  
I came runnin' every time you cried,  
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes,  
Ha Ha very nice to know, that you ain't got no place left to go.  
  
Chorus


Easy come and easy go  
Hard to get a hold on  
Searching for what you don't know  
Blind to where you belong  
Feel the power in your dreams  
Vision in your sight  
Nothing's dark as it may seem  
We can make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
I have faith  
In your love  
I have faith  
In your heart  
You don't need to hide from what you want  
You've just got to give it all you got  
The first thing that you need  
You got to have faith  
  
Truth hidden between the lies  
We both know the chances  
Nothing comes from compromise  
Only strength advances  
I will be here at your side  
For everything you do  
When the world tears at your pride  
I'll be there for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the world's coming at you like a hungry alligator  
You got to have faith  
When you've got to pay them now or they'll take it from you later  
You got to have faith  
When you feel like the future's hiding on a distant cloud  
You got to have faith  
And you feel like shouting at the good Lord out loud  
You got to have faith  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you know that you're ready but the time is not right  
You got to have faith  
And you lie awake staring at the ceiling all night  
You got to have faith


CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FILL THE SKIES  
WITH COTTON CANDY CLOUDS  
STEP INSIDE THE RAINBOW  
RIDE WHERE DRAGONFLIES SING LOUD  
COLORS FALLING, BUTTERFLIES AND FLOWERS  
PAINT THE GROUND  
CUCKOOS CALLING, DO I HAVE TO GO  
AND IT'S HARD, SO HARD TO FORGET HER  
  
THIS IS WHERE WE ALWAYS SAID  
THAT EVERYTHING IS REAL  
HANGING FROM A SPIDER'S WEB  
THE VALLEYS AND THE FIELDS  
FOLLOW ME INSIDE THE TREE  
AND CATCH ME IF YOU CAN  
SOMEONE ELSE IS PLAYING IN THE SAND  
AND IT'S HARD, SO HARD TO FORGET HER  
  


(graham russell)  
A long time ago, from the valley of the sun  
Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
(chorus)  
It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see  
  
(chorus)  
Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time  
  
(chorus)  
It is the trees in the earth,  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all  
Our love for the heart of the rose  


[Chorus]  
Here I am playing with those memories again  
And just when I thought time had set me free  
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me  
  
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew  
Though each and every part of me has tried  
Only you can fill that space inside  
  
So there's no sense pretending  
My heart it's not mending  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
And just when I thought I could stand on my own  
Oh baby those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without  
  
On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone  
I've done everything I can to ease the pain  
But only you can stop the rain  
  
I just can't live without you  
I miss everything about you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
And just when I thought I could stand on my own  
Oh baby those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without  
Go on without  
It's just no good without you


Pictures of you race across my mind  
Filling all the space there is to find  
Melting love's own ice that lay so frozen  
I give that sacrifice for feeling chosen  
  
So if I face another day without you next to me  
I'll lock you in my mind and wish away the key  
  
CHORUS  
Hope springs eternal when you're near  
All the passion reappears  
All emotion seems so strong  
  
Hope springs eternal through your eyes  
Draws me closer to your side  
And keeps me there where I belong  
  
Given back the trust that was so fleeting  
Captured by one my heart was seeking  
Taken to my destiny's horizon  
Searching for the moon we see it rising  
  
And in the silence of the night, I hold you next to me  
Feeling dreams take flight, they set the spirit free  
  
CHORUS  
  


I've dance alone a thousand times  
To songs that no one else could even hear  
I've reached into the flame of love  
I couldn't hold it  
And it disappeared  
I've lived to learn to hate the blues  
I've lived with everything but you  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin' just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good, it's too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin' here with you  
ooh  
I can't believe my eyes  
  
I've felt the empty hands of time  
As they were stealin' all my life away  
I've heard the silence here inside  
Waiting for words that lovers  
Could not say  
You turn a little into stone  
With every night you spend alone  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin' just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good, it's too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin' here with you  
Ooh  
Still, when I see you lyin' here  
I can't believe my eyes


Every since feeling now would take my life into a year ago  
You say you love me again  
I can't say what I cannot do  
It's been too long without someone  
How could you let me sink this far away from you  
Now you're here wondering why you can't get near  
  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I used to do  
  
I'm turning back the pages now  
I pleaded with you all so many times  
Trying just to make you see  
Hoping that I might be the one  
So come down love me and it'll be alright  
The time to bring back love is not tonight  
I never thought I'd have to say  
that you should leave and go your way  
  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I used to do  
  
Not in love, still not in love with you  
Not in love, I'm still not in love with you  
Not in love, still not in love with you  
Not in love  
  
Tell me why you can't leave me lonely  
Tell me why I'm taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I used to do  
  
Can't get excited, I can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I use to do  
Can't get excited, I can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited


I have the ring that needs your finger  
I want you always to remember  
I want you to be a part of my dreams  
I was so lonely here without you  
I was so cold just like a statue  
Being with you has made me complete  
  
I can feel your loving touch inside me  
I can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
  
Every day and every night  
I never thought your love could feel so right  
Every day and through the night  
Let me be the one to hold you tight  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let to  
You're a part of me, don't you know  
  
Would you give me just a lifetime  
I'll stand beside you through the years that come and go  
Nothing at all could stand in our way  
  
I can feel your answer deep inside me  
I can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
  
Every day and every night  
I never thought your love could feel so right  
Every day and through the night  
Let me be the one to hold you tight  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let to  
You're a part of me, don't you know


I come alive (date with an Angel)  
  
Everyday I prayed that I would find a lover  
Then I looked into your eyes and I discovered  
Something was changing in my life  
Turning the darkness into light  
  
When I'm with you I come alive  
I feel I'm living in heaven  
You make the wrong turn out so right  
I'm gonna love you forever  
  
There is not a thing that I would change about you  
And my life was never quite the same without you  
You made the rain clouds go away  
Bringing me sunshine everyday  
  
When I'm with you I come alive  
I feel I'm living in heaven  
You make the wrong turn out so right  
I'm gonna love you forever  
  
In your arms you make me warm  
You give me strength to carry on  
I know I won't be alone  
As long as I'm with you


Who are we to say who we must obey  
to get much better, ooh to get much better,  
Who are we to say there's only one way to read the letter,  
A decision to make and here I must be sure  
it will not break me,  
Not a friend in the place to say to my face  
if I'm right or if I'm wrong.  
  
Who are we to say what we must throw away,  
it doesn't matter, ooh it doesn't matter  
This is for me, this is for you,  
it's not inspiring it's not the right thing  
I can't accept some things,  
irrespective of how long you tell me  
You can make me give in but that's because  
I'm stronger than I should be.  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't believe you, I don't believe the things you say  
There's another way, I can choose to take  
There's another way and it's for me to make  
  
When there's a voice to tell you the choice,  
you will remember, ooh you will remember  
Know what to take, what decisions to make without thinking  
I can't accept some things,  
I never will say yes when I don't mean to,  
You am make me give in but that's because  
I'm happy when I'm with you.  
  
[Chorus]


(graham russell)  
I called on you today  
I know it's late to say I'm sorry  
There's so much on my mind  
I feel as though the time is upon me  
Do you know you take my heart through the door  
Are there words to tell you what I live for  
(chorus)  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
  
Let me dry your eyes  
Is this the last time I can hold you?  
There's hope in this soul  
And words that will tread where you go to  
  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me  
  
(chorus)  
You have the hand that I need to get by  
Understand what it is that's turning me down  
  
(chorus)  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me  
  
(chorus)  


I just like the feeling  
You give me when the time is right  
I just like the feeling  
When you tell me you'll be here tonight  
Let me believe that this moment is good for you too  
When you leave it's not really all through  
Does it get to you  
I just like the feeling  
Of pretending that some day you'll stay  
I just like the feeling  
That your love is not too far away  
Tell me again  
That you'll stay for as long as you can  
When I'm really not part of the plan  
  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
Closest to love  
  
I just like the feeling  
When you're next to me without a sound  
I just like the feeling  
When you tell me that you're all unwound  
  
One night I'm yours and tonight  
You can have nothing less  
Tomorrow I long for the rest  
Tell me a lie  
If it helps me get through one more day  
You know I'll be here anyway  
  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
Closest to love  
  
One night I'm yours and tonight  
You can have nothing less  
Tomorrow I long for the rest  
Tell me a lie  
If it helps me get through one more day  
You know I'll be here anyway  
  


(graham russell)  
You didn't have to be so mad  
When you ran across the road  
The light alone soon told me  
You had a heavy load  
But I can't see why you didn't stay  
Why you didn't come to see if I felt  
The same way  
And I do, and I do  
I never asked for any comfort  
To take up your time  
But now I feel so very different  
I need to make you mine  
And I want to take what you have to  
Give me  
And bring you the words that fall  
From my head  
And I will, and I will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will  
Know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  


I've been staring at the floor  
And I've been holding back the tears  
And I'd been talking to the walls  
If the walls had ears  
  
And now it seems that every time  
I look into your eyes  
There is only so far I can see  
  
[Chorus:]  
So take me back there  
Where only we can go  
When you touch me the memories unfold  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love?  
  
I've been looking to the future  
And I've been dreaming of our past  
But now I'm counting on this moment  
'Cause it may be the last  
  
And days go by and still I try  
To reach into your soul  
There is only so far I can go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Remember the times when our world was alive  
And all of the answers were clear  
Remember the times when our souls would ignite  
And passion explodes into fears  
  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love?


Hard as a diamond's eye  
Soft as a last goodbye  
These are the things we learn to be  
  
Calm as a distant light  
That shines on an island night  
These are the thoughts that say:  
It's not too late to tell you,  
I know I wanna tell you  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  
Cold as the arctic ice  
Hot as a passion's rise  
These are the days I spend alone  
Pure as an infant's heart  
That beats through the light and dark  
These are the pictures of you  
Always getting closer  
I wanna hold you closer  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there when love starts calling  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  
I only wish my heart  
Could fly like it does  
When I sit and dream  
I'll never wake again  
As I hold you tenderly  
My thoughts were real  
And being with you now is the only  
Thought that's strong,  
It's a lonely night, and I'm trying  
To hold on...  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there when love starts calling  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  


Here I am again  
I've come to see you smile  
I know you understand  
I have to say again  
It's only for awhile  
  
And still you're always here  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a Way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all  
  
CHORUS  
It doesn't happen every day  
But it happened to me once before  
Those early years I threw away  
Now I only have to hear your voice  
To make me feel so sure  
That your love is why  
I want to give it all  
  
Don't the minutes fly  
And hours just seem so few  
With days apart so long  
It's hard to spend my time  
When I'm so far from you  
  
And still you're always there  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all


If it's love that you want, there will always be someone  
If it's love that you need, I can lay here at your feet  
When your fingers want to hold someone close to you  
Oh, don't you know baby  
  
I want you...  
When it's time to begin, you can tell me, let me in  
Every moment, every day, I'll be waiting every way  
'Til you're here next to me and you want me too  
  
Oh, don't you want, baby I know you  
I want you...  
If it's love that you want, there will always be someone  
If it's love that you need and you want me too  
  
Don't you want, baby I know you  
Breathe in my love, breathe out your love  
Before its too late, too late  
I want you...


Stay with me only if your heart is free,  
There's no sense if we can't see beyond how we feel.  
Honestly, how do we know what we need?  
What can we believe?, help me to know this is real.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
Broken dreams are never really what they seem,  
Somewhere in between you can give all your troubles to me.  
I don't know how far we are meant to go,  
If you tell me so that is where I want to be.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
I'll give my love to you.  
  


When the sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
I'll be so close to you  
  
When you're dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
You'll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
All those days of endless waiting  
I'll be thinking of you  
  
When thunder breaks the dawn  
When all muy strength is gone  
When shadows disappear  
I'll still be holding on  
  
When then sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
I'll be so close to you  
  
When you're dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
You'll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
  
I'll be thinking of you  
  


We give, we take, we bend until we break  
We touch and feel, to hurt or heal  
And in the end  
  
We run so far from who we really are  
And we starve and thirst, we praise and curse  
And I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
  
We shout and scream, but it's just a silly dream  
And we hold it inside like its live or die  
Till in the end we learn to wait  
And we squeeze the hands of fate  
And we twist and turn  
We freeze and burn, but I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
Through the time and space  
I'll always see your face  
And if I must count every star  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
  


All last night we lay in bed making love  
I never felt so much before with anyone  
Never had to say a word  
It was all right there  
The warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere  
  
And if I never have another love  
Well at least I had last night  
Now I know how the feeling grows  
Cause you made me come alive  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never get enough, never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I'll never get enough, never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I only want to give you more  
  
Now you're gone, I'm all alone just lying here  
Waiting for the moment when I'll feel you near  
Never asked if you'd come back,  
I was too damn proud  
I just smile and touched your hair  
As you went out  
  
[Chorus]


I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky  
I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high  
Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)  
But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
Suddenly came the dawn (from the night), suddenly I was born (into light)  
How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive


(graham russell)  
  
All my life I've been a manual man  
I like the floor all the power in my hand  
Driving up and down the road all day  
Overtaking anything in the way  
Alongside us came a man in a grin  
Winding down the window clever again  
You know manual is far too old  
To keep pace then he left us cold  
  
It's automatic, it's automatic  
It's automatic, it goes by itself  
  
  
Quick thinking and a mutual aim  
So on finding out the name of the game  
A different unit was ordered that day  
Who wants to go thru' the gears anyway  
The same color the same design  
The same car with a different mind  
Knowing now we wouldn't take second place  
Both saying with a smile on our face.


Take the river to the highest mountain  
Take the ocean to the farthest sea  
I'd take back everything I've said to hurt you  
If you'd come back to me  
  
I'd bring you fire from the frozen waters  
Leave a flower 'neath a fallen tree  
I'd take back everything I said to scare you  
Away from me  
  
Two hands can feel so much more  
That's what I'm loving you for  
I was too blind to see fear was inside of me  
I'm not afraid anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
It's never too late, it's never too late  
To forgive and forget  
Tell me that it isn't over, tell me that it isn't over  
I'll never hold you again  
  
If a broken wing can still be mended  
Then a foolish heart can still be true  
Take the river to the highest mountain  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Two hearts can feel so much more  
That's what I'm loving you for  
The man that you tried to free  
Is still locked inside of me  
And your heart must open the door  
  
[Chorus]


And the money she gave me, wasn't enough to pay the rent,  
But before I get some all my money's long been spent,  
It's nice to get away from all the noise back home  
It's harmless in a way we don't have that far to go.  
  
And in June we're three,  
And it's nice, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
With the rain came freedom, never was one more word so true  
In the ragged morning then the word came alive in you  
  
And I tried, and I tried for you  
It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
All the food that we could buy wasn't enough to keep just one alive.  
But we came through summer letting autumn close your eyes.  
  
And I tried, and I tried for you.  
I can take it, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, that's all.


I stand alone I'm just a face in the crowd  
I get lonely if the truth be said  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
But I try to understand instead  
I wish I had the strength inside to walk  
Right up to you  
I'd never have to hide behind these  
Doubts I know are true  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one you're  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too, but it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say  
  
So I listen for the perfect moment  
To rush to you but my heart's too slow  
Everybody here can see me stumble  
Better wait until the lights get low  
Wish I had the strength inside to walk  
Right up to you  
I wouldn't have to hide behind these  
Doubts I know are true  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one your  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too  
  
But it's hard for me  
Yes it's hard for me  
Yes it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one you're  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too, but it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say


I've got your love I don't now how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
I've got your love I don't know why you hid it  
I've never felt like this before  
  
I won't fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You haven't noticed you never say that any more  
  
I've got your love  
And it's a perfect reason for understanding life some more  
  
Burnt your fingers before  
Burnt your finger before  
  
I've got your love I don't know how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
I've got your love it's such a total feeling  
I don't know where it all began  
  
I won't fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You haven't noticed you never say that any more  
  
I've got your love  
And if I lose all others  
It wouldn't really hurt at all  
I've got your love I don't know how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
  
I've got your love I've got your love  
I don't know why it seemed so long


Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man  
  
Knock upon my window  
Late at night making me believe  
that something's not right  
I look through the window but all I can see  
Is the rain  
Standing on my doorstep  
Not very old looking so helpless  
And looking so cold  
A woman in need of some help  
Most have lost her way  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man  
  
As we sat by the fire  
The flame just grew  
Talking about just the things we knew  
Watching a new day arise outside my room  
The more I listened the more she told  
And in fascination my heart was sold  
Weaving in and out of my mind  
With a skidder off now  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man


I've had a lot of big dreams  
I've made a lot of bad moves  
I know you could walk away  
But you never do  
  
I've met a lot of cold hearts  
I've learned to smile and deceive  
I know I'm hard to be around  
But you never leave  
  
I'm not easy to understand  
But you hold out your hand  
  
And you say you love me  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me, need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am, just as I am  
  
I've made a lot of heartaches  
I've found a lot of closed doors  
When all the others turn away  
You love me more  
You love me more  
  
I'm not easy to understand  
But you hold out your hand  
  
And you say you love me  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me, need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am, just as I am  
  
I want to love forever  
To keep our world together  
And be the best that I can be  
Baby, every time the world  
Caves in on me  
  
And you say  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me, need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am, just as I am  


(graham russell)  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
With me every day till I pass away  
I've been sitting here  
Frightened stiff with fear  
Love has brought it on  
And it must go on  
Being here with you,  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
And here we are, here we are  
All alone for me to take  
And here you are, here you are  
All alone for me to take  
Fell in love today  
Little words to say  
Let us close the door  
That's what doors are for  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  


I'm late again, oh how the evening flies  
You meet old friends and share the secrets they hide  
It's not like me, to be this much unconcerned  
The drinks are free, I know this time I will bur  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here.  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Ooooooohhhh, I'm late again  
  
So I get home, and nothing there seems the same.  
I'm walking slow, and no one remembers my name  
I bring a smile, and, saying I'm losing my mind  
I realize that you've been wasting my time  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Oooohhhhh, I'm late again....Yeah....  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
No one home, yes I'm late again.....  
Our love, guess I'll wait again.....  
  
REPEAT  


(graham russell)  
  
As long as I live all that I receive is what I want to give to you  
I know that if I can stay for a while you will soon love me too  
Let's take a chance at least we'll learn a lesson  
It beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days  
I don't want to love you in two different ways  
  
Do you want to give, do you want to give me you whole day and more  
Do you want to give, do you want always the key to the door  
It's easy for you talking your way out of all situations  
When you can't see thru' and leave it up to me  
And that's what I do  
And that's what I do  
  
  
Love comes to me and leaves me with you  
Love runs thru' me in all that you do  
Don't walk away, don't leave me standing here  
That's not the way, don't lead me anywhere  
I need you now, I need you now  
Don't leave me standing here  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
It's much too fast for me can't we go slow  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
What do you want me to do


Love conquers time without fear, without proof  
It will rise it will strike in your name  
Love conquers time like the light from the moon  
It must never be taken in vain  
  
So when you feel the beat is gone  
The love you give away will carry on  
  
Love conquers time just like tears in the sand  
It will change with each direction you try  
Love conquers time from the moment you fall  
To those arms like a child you will fly  
  
So when you feel the beat is gone  
The love you give away will carry on  
It will carry on  
  
Seasons rise and fall from a silent command  
Beyond that place of our forever  
The road goes on to where it can never end  
  
Love conquers time without fear, without proof  
It will rise it will strike in your name  
Love conquers time like the light from the moon  
It must never be taken in vain  
  
Love conquers time just like tears in the sand  
It will change with each direction you try  
Love conquers time from the moment you fall  
To those arms like a child you will fly  
  


When we come into this world  
And we hunger for the touch  
From the one that brought us life  
From the one that gave so much  
  
Innocence will take your hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind  
  
Don't you know that love is all  
Love is where we all begin  
And when we knock on heaven's door  
Only love will let us in  
  
And as we gather to ourselves  
A part of everything we see  
We realize that what we own  
Isn't what we really need  
  
Innocence take my hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind  
  
Don't you know that love is all  
Love is where we all begin  
Love is all that we must do  
It is the reason why we live  
Love is all I have for you  
  
True love cannot be broken  
Through all the tears of pain  
Only one truth survives,  
Only one truth remains  
  


So many miles it seems  
Nothing can come between, your life and mine  
Before the ink is dry  
I feel just you and I, inside my mind  
  
Love is the arrow, fly straight and true  
Into this deep and fallow hart  
What am I to do  
What am I to do  
  
Another world to spin  
A distant tide come in, they always do  
A mother holds the son  
A lover waits alone, like me for you  
  
Love is the arrow, fly straight and true  
Into this deep and fallow hart  
What am I to do, what am I to do  
  
Into the highest cloud  
Before a word is spoken  
Beyond the slighest doubt  
Before the dream is woken  
  


I want you to brighten the days of my life  
I want you and I all alone to be together at night  
  
I can't stand it  
The feeling when you're far away  
I want to wrap you up in my little world  
So you'll be here today  
  
When we fly through the night  
Can't you feel the rush of 1,000 dancers  
come into your life  
I'll be there to make it right  
  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right  
  
I want you to put your trust in me  
Say goodbye to all your heartaches as fast as you can  
I need you to surrender to me all your body and soul  
And the spirit we seek will enter us both and make us complete  
  
When we fly through the night  
And it feels like heaven's wings we're riding  
You've got to hold on tight  
If you feel like I do  
Knowing nothing can go wrong between us  
I'll be there to make it right, make it right  
  
Know me, show me  
All your love  
You're here today  
You know you're here always  
You know I can't get enough  
You know I can't get enough  
  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right


I know just how to whisper  
And I know just how to cry  
I know just where to find the answers  
And I know just how to lie  
I know just how to fake it  
And I know just how to scheme  
I know just when to face the truth  
And then I know just when to dream  
And I know just where to touch you  
And I know just what to prove  
I know when to pull you closer  
And I know when to let you loose  
And I know the night is fading  
And I know the time's gonna fly  
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I've gotta tell you  
But I know I've gotta give it a try  
And I know the roads to riches  
And I know the ways to fame  
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em  
And I always know the name of the game  
But I don't know how to leave you  
And I'll never let you fall  
And I don't know how you do it  
  
Making love out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all  
Making love out of nothing at all  
  
Everytime I see you all the rays of the sun are  
Streaming through the waves in your hair  
And every star in the sky is taking aim at  
Your eyes like a spotlight  
The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost  
And it's looking for a rhythm like you  
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night  
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright  
I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know  
Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you  
I can make the runner stumble  
I can make the final block  
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  
I can make all the stadiums rock  
I can make tonight forever  
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made  
And I can make all your demons be gone  
But I'm never gonna make it without you  
Do you really want to see me crawl  
And I'm never gonna make it like you do  
  
Making love out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all


I was thinking about miracles  
When you were fast asleep  
Of all the things we tried to find  
It's only love we keep  
And I don't ever want to wake you  
Your dreams are taking you so far  
It's there that I can always touch you  
For love is where you are  
(CHORUS)  
Fall upon me, take love from me  
Nothing is more beautiful to see  
Walk beside me, grow inside me  
All I have, you gave to me  
Each day another miracle  
That time can never take  
If time should come to claim you now  
He knows it's much too late  
So let the gates of dawn fly open  
And cast your light for all to see  
The chains of morning now are broken  
And you are drifting into me  
CHORUS (x2)  
  


Love I'll help you to see  
The world is ours it used to be  
But now it's changed so much  
We have to change it back  
Soon will be a day  
When just a look will be to say  
Let's break away today  
Let's start again I'll tell you where  
I'll tell you when  
You came from out of the air  
And wrapped in fire  
  
Said don't you be scared  
Can't you use your life  
To save so many more  
Cast my pride away  
And had me born again that very day  
And now I'm so alive  
I'm comin' through  
They're teaching me to tell it to you  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  
Oh your hearts would say  
My mind is gone  
And ran away  
But who's the loser if you don't know  
What I have  
A job that's hard to beat  
Looking out for holey feet  
Treading softly on the ground  
Making waves but not a sound  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  


Mother said, don't leave me  
There are monsters at the door  
I put on all my armour  
But I couldn't find my sword  
But there'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
If they come to take you prisoner  
I'll be there to set you free  
  
Mother said, I'm grown up  
In a Sunday shirt and tie  
As long as I can see you  
Can I hold you when I cry  
There'll always be tomorrow  
I'll be so big and strong  
I'll sleep with all the lights out  
Not afraid of anyone  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Mother said she's sleeping  
So I climbed back into bed  
But the monsters took her prisoner  
That's all that father said  
So I thought about tomorrow  
And I learned to be alone  
Making friends with shadows  
As they moved around my home  
  
Mother never leaves me  
I can always see her smile  
  
I sit here in the evening  
To talk to her awhile  
There'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
I know that any moment  
She will come to set me free  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  


You're here looking like my best friend  
Hoping you'll find a way  
To tell me you just can't stay  
  
You laughed hard at the world, I know  
Now that the seasons show  
To tell me, love, your heart will soon mend  
  
We counted everyday  
Only to show we needed each other  
Who needs a reason to love  
When friends just seem to know  
They know it  
  
You have lots of dreams, I know  
Now it's the close of the show  
Let's hope it'll all passes by in the end  
So get yourself along  
You're my best friend


I know you're leaving  
I won't ask you to stay  
I won't hold you back  
I won't stand in your way  
If that's what you've gotta do, I understand  
It's not that easy setting you free  
But that's how it's gotta be  
And as you're walking away  
As I'm watching you go  
There's one thing I want you to know  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
I'm just a heartbeat away  
Saying goodbye isn't saying were through  
Just know through it all I'm still here for you  
Light a light in the window  
When your lost in the dark, ooh  
These arms would be happy to hold you again  
If ever you miss me or when you  
Start thinking about  
All the nights that we shared  
Darling, you know Ill be there  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
You walk to the door with nothing to say  
I look in your eyes and you look away  
You're leaving me now, but darling, I hope  
Hope that you'll look back someday  
And remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no one's there to hold when you're all alone  
Baby, take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that you're all alone  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that you're all alone  


Walking along the boulevard  
Speaking into the air  
Where can I find the life  
I know that only dreams can share  
I close my eyes and see you there  
Calling me far beyond  
Wrapped in a robe of mystery  
You wave your magic wand  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can fly to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
Walking along the boulevard  
Wishing we were complete  
Why are some things so very hard to witness and believe  
  
The victor of this universe  
The victim of the wind  
Where does a dream begin and end  
And where does life begin  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can climb to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
We can climb to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  


(graham russell)  
I never saw it happen  
I never saw the flame  
I never new how much there was  
To lose and gain  
But when the sun was taken  
You never shone so bright  
And from a place we'd long forgotten  
The blind were given sight  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you to  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of  
(chorus)  
If I hold you now from my point of view  
Will you show me how to be close to you  
If the dawn should break and you're  
Far away  
Can you ever know what I need to say  
I can see how much I was taking it all  
For granted  
Among the silent victims  
Only the wind would moan  
And for a time I felt us touch  
The great unknown  
For that eternal moment  
Oh what a price to pay  
With nothing left but all we have  
We slowly walked away  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you too  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of  
  
(chorus)  
So give life to your dreams  
For there lies your survival  
And cast your heart beyond those  
Faded scenes  
And I'll bring you through that storm  
Yes I'll bring you back  
  
(chorus)  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere...  


If I had to live my life without you near me  
The days would all be empty  
The nights would seem so long  
With you I see forever oh so clearly  
I might have been in love before  
But it never felt this strong  
Our dreams are young and we both know  
They'll take us where we want to go  
Hold me now, touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
  
Chorus:  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now how much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than your love  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now how much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothing's gonna change my love for you  
  
If the road ahead is not so easy  
Our love will lead a way for us  
Like a guiding star  
I'll be there for you if you should need me  
You don't have to change a thing  
I love you just the way you are  
So come with me and share the view  
I'll help you see forever too  
Hold me now, touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
  
Chorus


When love is new  
And the world is out reaching for you  
We try hard to hold it all  
In our hands  
But it slips through  
Like soft drifting sands  
But drying the tears  
Can build it all like new  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now and forever  
Remember the words  
From my heart will always be true  
Now and forever  
Together and all that I feel  
Here's my love for you  
  
Learning each day  
That the right time was so far away  
To tell you the things I knew  
Now it's clear  
That the moment  
We searched for is here  
And counting the years  
Is all I want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me as close  
As love will allow  
Until all your fears are gone  
What has all passed  
Is over now  
I'm here with you  
I'm here with you  
I'm holding on  
I'm holding on  
Is my love for you  
  
[Chorus]


O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him  
Born the King of Angels  
  
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord  
  
Sing choirs of angels  
Sing in exaltation  
Oh sing all ye citizens of Heaven above  
Glory to God  
All glory in the highest  
  
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord  
  
Yeah Lord we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
O Jesus to thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord,  
Christ the Lord  
O come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord


Seems like yesterday my life had begun  
As we went through life trying to make it so much fun  
And I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
Lost restrictions since you've been gone  
And it's so hard trying to say that I was wrong  
Now I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
You know and I know  
that you can't live on memories alone  
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of  
Just one habit that I can't shake off  
It's you  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
Now I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of  
Just one habit that I can't shake off  
It's you  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard


I didn't really walk away I had something to explain  
Trying to reach you night and day when I did not know your name  
Shall we promise just to talk of it alone, all alone  
  
Why can't the voice that said hello at the moment of first sight  
Whisper the words I need to know speak to me that way tonight  
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  
One step closer forward motion  
One step nearer our destination  
One step closer forward motion  
One step nearer our destination  
  
How can I bring myself to sleep till I'm resting by your side  
Sharing the secrets hard to keep  
When you live them all through the night  
And then wake up with the words I'll always want you to say  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  
  
A lonely man has come undone  
Is it wrong to think I understand when you are as close to me  
And not much further to go  
  
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  


There has to be a place for you and me  
Where we can sleep and waters still run deep  
And you're the one that sails into me  
And you're the one whose lips are silent  
You're the one that always said  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together,  
There's only one forever  
You said to me, just give me honesty  
And in return, I'll build your santuary  
Long ago, that path was chosen  
How could we not fall in love  
Remember when we always said  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together  
There's only one forever  
You're the one that sails into me  
You're the one whose lips are silent  
You're the one that always said  
There's only one forever  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together  
There's only one forever  
  


Peaches and cream  
  
The light was on, and everything I felt was strong  
I watched as your mascara ran  
Didn't get far on that golden tan  
  
I heard you sigh, but I don't wanna see you cry  
You looked just like a walking dream  
Sweeter than peaches and cream  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you want me let me know  
I can show you how  
If you've got nowhere to go  
I can show you now  
  
I'm yours to tame, and I don't even know your name  
I like to touch your perfect skin  
I can't stop once I begin  
  
To show you more than I have ever shown before  
If you could read what's on my mind  
Give me yours and I'll give you mine  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We could be, we could see  
More than we know  
We should be, we should see  
More than we know  
And I'd like to know  
  
(Chorus)(Twice)  
  
Sweeter than peaches and cream (If you want me let me know)  
Sweeter than peaches and cream (I can show you how)  
(Repeat and fade)


Painted sands and makeshift hands take us round and round  
Horizon clear, you'll soon be near and walking on the ground  
I've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight  
If you sail across the border, we can float into the night  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
  
Cloudy Sky, the wind is high and trying to break the spell  
But I'll be here when you appear I'll see the nijtht as well  
A feeling's not a feeling if you can't believe it's true  
I'd sooner be believing 'til the ship comes sailing through'  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
  
I've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight  
If you sail across the border, we can float into the night  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  


Well I've got friends in the states  
And I've got friends out in space  
When information's your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito  
  
(chorus)  
I love my trade,  
I've got my future made.  
I put my life on the line  
To save this country of mine  
And they reward me with love  
And see I have a good time.  
So all my moves must be fast  
'cause every day is my last  
A secret agent that's slow  
Almost certain to go.  
  
(chorus)  
I've got friends in the states  
I've got friends out in space  
When information's your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito.  
  
(chorus)


Across the concrete sky come walk with me  
Something we need to know  
Something we need to see  
Is it love, yes its love  
Only love that is growing inside me  
If it's love, yes it's love  
Only love, is the pillar of plenty  
  
You, you make me feel, this is all I need  
And it's all so real  
You help me understand, where I want to be  
When I touch your hand  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
  
Untie the sails, the shore will melt away  
Without a trace, I hear the raven say  
When it's love, this is love, when it's love  
That we must know we must enter  
This is love, this is love, only love  
When the dove is descended  
  
You are the winding stream going to somewhere  
That we' ve never seen  
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream  
And the final prayer  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
Reach out for the shadow of the sun  
Cry out for the shadow of the sun  
You are the colors of the wind  
Singing hopes, eternal spring  
In a symphony for every lonely year  
You are the keeper of the key  
And the one that longs to be  
The light for each and every frozen tear  
  


One warm night I fell in love  
The air was still, the words would flow  
We knew each other oh so well  
And though just met you'd never tell  
Sometimes we're just lonely hearts  
That ride upon a floating card  
Prepared to live those sleepless nights  
For precious time in paradise  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  
There's no regrets, we made the choice  
We listened to that silent voice  
That haunts you 'til you just give in  
And makes you like a child again  
We drifted close then said goodbyes  
Just reading well each other's eyes  
The world had turned while we stood still  
And held on to each other  
And in between the right and wrong  
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I cried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling Yoo-hoo  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray  
It would be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing  
Without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop  
  
There's a happy feeling nothin' in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
  
It will nearly be like a picture print of Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives  
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you


When you first found love  
Was it all that you had wanted  
For a thousand lonely years  
Was the memory so sweet  
Now your scented touch brings me  
Back to the enchanted  
All shadows fade away  
The gypsy is complete  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone is walking beside me  
Someone is waiting till I say yes I do  
Someone is living inside me  
Giving me all that I need and I need you  
Someone to cry on my shoulder  
I just want to stay here forever  
  
From the secret pool  
Did I stare at your reflection  
Let the water wash away all the battle  
From my soul  
For the bride of spring,  
Do I swear to your protection  
Today will be the day that never shall  
Grow old  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Silence broken and the blackbird is free  
Only your voice can I hear, speak to me  
  
[Chorus]


When there's a dark storm on your horizon  
And you think you can't get through it  
Just put your hand in my hand  
And I'll show you how to do it  
When the future looks uncertain  
You can count on me to be there  
And when your heart and soul are hurtin'  
Just look and you'll see me there  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
A love that's always true  
And someone who believes in you  
So when you're searching for that rainbow  
I will help you find it  
And when a mountain stands before you  
I will help you climb it  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
A love that's always true  
And someone who believes in you  
It's time to come alive  
Your moment has arrived  
I'll bring out the best in you  
We can have it all  
No, we will never fall  
Looking down from our celestial view  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
And I'll tell you something else  
You'll start believing in yourself  
It's an easy thing to do  
When you have someone who believes in you  
Someone who believes  
Someone who believes  
I'm someone who believes  
And you've got someone who believes in you


I've been in love, I've walked alone  
I turned to you, but you were gone  
I felt the doubt, it hurt me inside  
Without your help, my hands are tied  
  
You are my home, my place to go  
My faith returned, you told me so  
I feel you now, I'm standing beside you  
Do you hear me calling  
It's to remind you, if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms,  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love  
  
Don't leave me know, I've come so far  
To hear your voice, speak from your heart  
I hear you now, you're standing beside me  
Do you hear me calling  
It's to remind you, if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words,  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love  
  


Love comes and goes,  
Destiny unknown  
Leads you to the promised land  
Or leaves you head in hand  
Tears fall like rain  
Coming down once again  
Stranger lost in a distant land  
Language hard to understand  
Seems like years have slipped away  
Still have so much left to say  
And I can't wait to see you  
(Chorus) When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
Now's the time to turn away  
From the ghost of yesterday  
When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
I'll be the one to shelter you  
The spirit of love will guide us through  
Love, right or wrong,  
Somehow we must carry on  
If only words were spoken true  
If only I could trust in you  
To believe in the dream of what could be  
Hidden clues to the mystery  
It's time to set yourself free  
(Chorus)  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
(Chorus)


We are civilized and free from all confusion  
And yet we always worry for the things that we can't see  
But now to give your love away, a miracle in motion  
You know what seems invisible will never ever be disguised to me  
  
I start to lose control  
I start to lose control  
  
CHORUS  
I know I will remember for longer than forever  
All the love and the stars in your eyes  
Until my arms surround you and build the world around you  
All I see are the stars in your eyes  
  
First you hear the angels sing and then you see the wedding ring  
Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven  
You know what you've found, you want to last forever  
You heart has found its wings and left for never never  
  
And then I lose control  
I start to lose control  
  
CHORUS  
  
I know I will remember for longer than forever  
All the love and the stars in your eyes  
  
CHORUS - REPEAT  
  


I stopped seeing all of our old friends  
I don't go to places that you've been  
I stopped talking about you  
Started living without you  
But there's just one thing, I don't understand  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years  
  
Everybody thinks that I'm so strong  
They don't know what I go through when I'm alone  
I start thinkin' about you  
Goin' crazy without you  
But I stop myself and I hang up the phone  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years  
  
One day, you'll call me up goin' crazy  
Too late you'll want me back  
You'll be sayin', you'll be saying  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years


Strangers in love must a star fall from the sky  
It's stranger than most and stranger when we try  
To understand it all, why we fall,  
As strangers in love,  
Strangers in love.  
Straight from the farm and a world apart and ready for-  
Someone to take her arm, she's never seen a movie  
  
What an innocent face, what an innocent place.  
It's natural, it's an easy thing to do,  
Natural, it's an easy thing to do.  
Strangers in love and a star fell from the sky  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn.  
Strangers in love


We walked away before  
There were too many storms  
We could not get through  
But I still kept loving you  
Now fate brought you back to me  
This time I won't let you leave  
I'm holding on to you, forever,  
I'm never letting go  
The time I spent away from you  
was time that made me see  
I need to live this life with you  
I need you here with me  
  
Now it would take a strong, strong wind  
To take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
  
Hearts sometimes lose their way  
But they find their way back someday  
To the arms they need  
And I need you like the air I breathe  
The time I spent away from you was time  
lost in the rain  
I'm meant to live this life with you  
That's something nothing can change  
  
And it would take a strong, strong wind  
To take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
  
This time I'm holding on with everything  
This time I won't let go for anything  
  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
Strong, strong wind


Tonight you are the world to me, part of the mystery  
And we don't need a reason to love  
Say you'll never go, that's all I need to know  
And when you close your eyes, I'll still be here  
And if the world falls  
You will be the only reason to love  
I'll find my way  
  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
If you hold me now, all that I feel is yours  
'cause' you're the only reason to love  
What you are to me, is all that you need to be  
And when you touch the stars, I will be there  
And when the world falls away  
I will be your only reason to love  
  
I'll find my way  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night


Watching the sun set so low  
Tells us that it's time, the day is too end  
Nobody cries as it leaves  
Or reaches for the light  
But soon back again  
  
But then I hear you sigh  
And wish that you could stay  
I'd like another day with you  
  
Don't want to know where it ends  
I'll live with either way  
Just tell me what I have to do.  
  
Where is the joy time forgets  
You ask me if I know  
It's still as before  
Up on a breeze soaring high  
It comes alive each day  
Whenever you call  
But now to lose your love  
The charm throughout my day  
To walk along our paths all alone  
  
I have memories enough  
To help me find my way  
To bring back all the love we've known


These days it's hard to make love last, so hard to do, it  
Seems these days it comes and goes so fast,  
So easy to lose it  
  
Promise me now, promise with you I'll find,  
One love to stand the test of time...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
  
We've got to make a solemn vow, keep it forever,  
Know whatever happens that somehow, we'll keep it together  
  
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand, and say that you...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
  
That you're gonna stand beside me  
Always be there,  
If you really care,  
Just stand here beside me and swear  
  
(Swear)  
(Swear)  
  
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand, and say that you...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart


This is the time when you need a friend  
You just need someone near  
I'm not looking forward to the night  
I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here  
  
How many times will I think about the things  
I'd like to do  
Always denied the right to live my life the way I want  
I want to share it with you  
  
Close your eyes  
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams  
Close your eyes  
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams  
  
I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by  
And I'll write the words you love  
What I can't say in a letter  
Will just have to wait till I get home  
  
There's not much time to tell you  
Half the things I should  
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you  
And I'd do it again if I could  
  
Close your eyes  
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams  
Close your eyes  
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams  
  
Sleep like a child resting deep  
You don't know what you give me I keep  
For these moments alone


You're in-between a page of life you never dreamed  
The answer won't come from that magazine  
this time it's real and you're not sure just what to feel  
Who can I trust to say  
Should I give love now should I take love now  
  
CHORUS  
I'm taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
  
Sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near  
I needed to make this choice on my own  
To let love in when I'm so scared when things begin  
Don't run away I feel close to you now  
You know I need you now  
  
CHORUS  
I'm taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
I'm taking the chance  
I can't let this feeling leave  
I don't want those nights of waiting so long  
I'm taking the chance before it's gone  
  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
On you  
  
CHORUS  
  


The first noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields where they lay  
In fields where they  
Lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the east  
Beyond them far  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
And let us all  
With one accord  
Sing praises to our heavenly lord  
That hath in heaven and earth of naught  
And with his blood mankind hath bought  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
Born is the king  
Born is the king  
Born is the king


Now you tell me that the time is right  
You've let your feeling go  
And you know I won't use them up too fast  
I can't promise you the best there is  
But ooh, I'm gonna try  
I'm never gonna let you go tonite  
  
Tonite, the start of a love to remember  
Tonite, a love that will never be ended  
Tonite, tonite  
  
Let me take you where there's no return  
Where dreams can all come true  
I've got the feeling we've been holding on too long  
What we're feeling is ours alone  
No one will ever know  
Just how we feel about tonite  
  
Tonite, the start of a love to remember  
Tonite, a love that will never be ended  
Tonite, tonite  
  
How many times has love fallen through  
When I left it all up to you  
I took your words when you said  
It's got to be just right  
I need you now I need you now  
  
Tonite, the start of a love to remember  
Tonite, a love that will never be ended  
Tonite, tonite  
  


One world, one love, these can never be apart  
Whisper in your words what is in your heart  
How can I stop this emotion knowing that it's true  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  
Midnight, candlelight  
Knowing you are close to me  
So much I have inside  
I've got to set it free  
  
With you silence can be spoken  
If love has broken through  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew that this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  
Ooh, sentimental man  
Am I saying too much too soon  
Cause I love you  
Such a gentle girl  
Waiting for you  
  
One love, two touch, we can never be apart  
I want you so much for what is in your heart  
How can we stop this emotion knowing that it's true  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew that this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  


Turnaround, every now and then I get a  
Little bit lonely and you're never coming around  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart


All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
From creation, the mask of God  
Inspiration is all we've got  
Hidden knowledge, can't get enough,  
Taking chances, making love  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, shedding skin  
Age of reason lies within  
Explanation, the club of Rome  
Meditation, and staying home  
Moving forward, the chosen few  
Teach your children what is new  
Band the table, beat the drum  
New messiah, overcome  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  


Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'  
Though your nose gets chillin'  
We'll frolic and play the eskimo way  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland


Before you go away  
To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
It's over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
CHORUS:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find it's me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now we're going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool


I've known you for so long  
You are a friend of mine  
But is this all we'd ever be?  
I've loved you ever since  
You are a friend of mine  
But babe, is this all we ever could be?  
  
You tell me things I've never known  
I've shown you love you've never shown  
But then again, when you cry  
I'm always at your side  
You tell me 'bout the love you've had  
I listen very eagerly  
But deep inside you'll never see  
This feeling of emptiness  
It makes me feel sad  
But then again I'm glad  
  
I've known you all my life  
You are a friend of mine  
I know this is how it's gonna be  
I've loved you then and I love you still  
You're a friend of mine  
Now, I know friends are all we ever could be  
  
You tell me things I've never known  
I've shown you love you've never shown  
But then again, when you cry  
I'm always at your side  
You tell me 'bout the love you've had  
And I listen very eagerly  
But deep inside you'll never see  
This feeling of emptiness  
It makes me feel sad  
  
But then again  
Then again  
Then again I'm glad


Kay bilis naman ng panahon  
Kailan lang tayo nagkatagpo  
Pareho ng hangarin iibig sa atin  
Ay matagpuan at di pakakawalan  
  
Di natin pinilit ang pagkakataon  
Pagkakaibiga'y nauwi sa pagmamahalan  
Ngunit ika'y nagbago natakot ang 'yong puso  
Na mahulog at umibig muli  
  
Wag mong iwan ang puso kong mag-isa  
Pagkat mabuhay ng wala ka'y di makakaya  
Sa sandaling ikaw ay lumisan  
Wala ng pag-asa sa aki'y maiiwan  
  
Wag mong sayangin ang pagmamahal  
Na ating pinangarap nang kay tagal  
Minsan lang sa buhay natin ang ganito  
Mahal ko, wag mong iwan ang puso ko  
  
Wag mong iwan ang puso kong mag-isa  
Pagkat mabuhay ng wala ka'y di makakaya  
Sa sandaling ikaw ay lumisan  
  
Wala ng pag-asa sa aki'y maiiwan


I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
In all the lovely things  
So fine and true  
I see you in the beauty  
Of the flowers and the rain  
I see you between the lines  
Of a sweet refrain  
I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
Even when I'm lonely and in pain  
I see you in the beauty of the stars at night  
I see you in my life  
I feel alright  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
In the smile of a baby  
Sweet and true  
I can see you in the eyes  
Of my very best friends  
I see you in these bonds  
Just like your love that never ends  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I pray...  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray...  
I see you Lord...


If a picture paints a thousand words  
Then why can't I paint you  
The words will never show  
The you I've come to know  
  
If a face could launch a thousand ships  
Then where am I to go  
There's no one home but you  
You're all that's left me too  
  
And when my love  
For life is running dry  
You'll come and pour yourself on me  
  
If a man could be two places  
At one time I'd be with you  
Tomorrow and today  
Beside you all the way  
  
If the world should start revolving  
Spinning slowly down to die  
I'd spend the end with you  
And when the world was through  
  
Then one by one  
The stars would all go out  
Then you and I would simply fly away


When I see you on the street  
I lose my concentration  
Just the thought that we might meet  
Creates anticipation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
  
Faces come and faces go  
In circular rotation  
But something yearns within to grow  
Beyond infatuation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind  
'Cause I see love as just a state of mind  
And who knows what it is that we might find  
If we try  
And who knows what it is that we might find  
If we try  
  
You've walkin' a diff'rent direction  
From most people I've met  
You've givin' me signs of affection  
I don't usually get  
I don't want you to pledge your future  
The future's not yours to give  
Just stand there a little longer  
And let me watch you while you leave  
  
'Cause when I see you on the street  
I lose my concentration  
And just the thought that we might meet  
Creates anticipation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
  
Somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
Yes, somehow I think that it just might  
If we try


Itanong mo sa akin  
Kung sino'ng aking mahal  
Itanong mo sa akin  
Sagot ko'y di magtatagal  
Ikaw lang ang aking mahal  
Ang pag-ibig mo'y aking kailangan  
Pag-ibig na walang hangganan  
Ang aking tunay na nararamdaman  
Isa lang ang damdamin  
Ikaw and aking mahal  
Maniwala ka sana  
Sa akin ay walang iba  
Ikaw lang ang aking mahal  
Ang pag-ibig mo'y aking kailangan  
Pag-ibig na walang hangganan  
Ang aking tunay na nararamdaman  
Ang nais ko sana'y inyong malaman  
Sa hilaga o sa timog o kanluran  
At kahit sa'n pa man  
Ang laging isisigaw  
Ang nais ko sana'y inyong malaman  
Sa hilaga o sa timog o kanluran  
At kahit sa'n pa man  
Ang laging isisigaw  
Ikaw ang aking mahal...  
Ikaw ang aking mahal...  
Ikaw ang aking mahal...


Ang ganda ng buhay, mahal kong Diyos  
Sana papuri sa 'Yoy tunay na malubos  
Nais kong mabuhay sa mundong kay ganda  
Na dinadakila'y pangalan Mo tuwina  
  
[Chorus]  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Dalangin namin ay pagpalain Mo sana  
Ikaw ang pag-ibig namin at pag-asa  
  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Tanging sa 'Yo lamang hihingi ng awa  
Sa bawat sandali Ikaw na ang bahala  
  
Makulay ang buhay, mahal kong Diyos  
Sana pagmamahal Mo sa mundo'y mabuhos  
Salamat sa pag-ibig na nasa puso ko  
Salamat sa buhay na galing sa Iyo  
  
[Chorus]  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Dalangin namin ay pagpalain Mo sana  
Ikaw ang pag-ibig namin at pag-asa  
  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Tanging sa 'Yo lamang hihingi ng awa  
Sa bawat sandali Ikaw na ang bahala(2x)  
  
Sa bawat sandali Ikaw na ang bahala


Strolling along country roads with my baby  
It starts to rain, it begins to pour  
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin  
I feel a shiver run up my spine  
I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
After a while we run under a tree  
I turn to him and he kisses me  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly he breathes and I close my eyes  
Sharing our love under stormy skies  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
[Break]  
  
I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside


Intro:  
  
Lying beside you, here in the dark  
Feeling your heart beat with mind  
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere  
How could our live be so blind  
We sailed on together  
We drifted apart  
And here you are by my side  
  
Chorus:  
  
So now I come to you, with open arms  
Nothing to hide, believe what I say  
So here I am with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me  
Open arms  
  
Ii.  
  
Living without you, living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near  
How much I wanted you home  
  
But now that you've come back  
Turned night into day  
I need you to stay.  
  
(Repeat Chorus)


[Verse 1]  
Nais kong malaman niya  
Nag mamahal ako  
'Yan lang ang nag-iisang pangarap ko  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Gusto ko mang sabihin  
Di ko kayang simulan  
Pag nagkita kayo  
Paki sabi na lang  
[Chorus]  
Paki sabi na lang na mahal ko siya  
Di na baleng may mahal siyang iba  
Paki sabing 'wag siyang mag-alala  
Di ako umaasa  
Alam kong ito'y malabo  
Di ko na mababago  
Ganun pa man paki sabi na lang  
Sana ay malaman niya  
  
[Verse 2]  
Masaya na rin ako  
Kahit na nasasaktan ang puso ko (kahit na nasasaktan ako)  
Wala na 'kong maisip na mas madali pang paraan  
[Pre-Chorus]Pag nagkita kayo  
Paki sabi na lang  
[Chorus]  
Paki sabi na lang na mahal ko siya  
Di na baleng may mahal siyang iba  
Paki sabing 'wag siyang mag-alala  
Di ako umaasa  
Alam kong ito'y malabo  
Di ko na mababago  
Ganun pa man paki sabi na lang(paki sabi na lang)  
Umiibig ako  
  
[Bridge]  
(Lagi siyang naririto sa puso ko)  
Paki sabi na lang  
(Pwede ba?)  
  
[Chorus]:  
Paki sabi na lang na mahal ko siya  
Di na baleng may mahal siyang iba  
Paki sabing 'wag siyang mag-alala  
Di ako umaasa  
Alam kong ito'y malabo  
Di ko na mababago  
Ganun pa man paki sabi na lang  
  
Paki sabi na lang na mahal ko siya  
Di na baleng may mahal siyang iba  
Paki sabing 'wag siyang mag-alala  
Di ako umaasa  
Alam kong ito'y malabo  
Di ko na mababago  
Ganun pa man paki sabi na lang  
(mahal ko siya)  
  
Ganun pa man paki sabi na lang  
(paki sabi na lang)  
  
Paki sabi na lang  
(paki sabi na lang)  
Mahal ko siya  
  
(paki sabi na lang)  
Paki sabi na lang  
(paki sabi na lang)  
Mahal ko siya

Put a little love  
Help me out!


Magmula giliw nang ika'y pumanaw  
Katawan at puso ko'y walang paglagyan  
Lakad ng dugo sa mukha ay madalang  
Lalo't magunita ang itong palayaw  
  
Saan pa tutungo yaring kalagayan  
Dalamhating lubos, liit ng katawan  
Masaya't kumain, hindi mapalagay  
Maupo't tumindig, alaala'y ikaw  
  
Paalam sa 'yo masarap magmahal  
May ari ng puso ko't kabiyak na katawan  
Paalam na nga, yaring pinalalayaw  
Paalam, giliw ko sayo'y paalam  
  
At kung gumabi na, banig ay ihihiga  
Matang nag-aantok, ipipikit na bigla  
Sa pagkahimbing, panaginip ka sinta  
Sabay ang balon na di mapigil na luha  
  
Lilimutin mo yaring kahabag habag  
Puhunang buhay tatawirin ang dagat  
Pag alis ay sakit, paroroonan ay hirap  
Masayang palad mo sa huli ang sikat  
  
Paalam sa 'yo masarap magmahal  
May ari ng puso ko't kabiyak na katawan  
Paalam na nga, yaring pinalalayaw  
Paalam, giliw ko  
  
Sama ng loob ko'y sa akin mag isa  
Di maipahayag sa mga kasama  
Puso ko ay lubos na pinagdurusa  
Tamis na bilin mo'y, magtiis ka sinta  
  
Paalam sa 'yo masarap magmahal  
May ari ng puso ko't kabiyak na katawan  
Paalam na nga, yaring pinalalayaw  
Paalam, giliw ko sayo'y paalam  
  
Paalam  
Masayang palad mo sa huli ang sikat.


Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing  
Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bituin  
Sa piling ni nanay, langit ay buhay  
Puso kong may dusa sabik sa ugoy ng duyan  
  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing  
Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bituin  
Sa piling ni nanay, langit ay buhay  
Puso kong may dusa sabik sa ugoy ng duyan  
  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Nais kong matulog sa dating duyan ko inay  
Oh,Inay


How thoughtless  
I had sometimes been  
I hurt you so badly  
But now I feel the pain  
I talked to you as if  
I knew just everything  
Maybe I didn't lose  
But I know I didn't win  
How careless  
I had sometimes been  
I gave you the heartache  
But I felt the pain  
I wanted to tell you  
How much I love you so  
I know I'd been careless  
I forgot to let you know  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to break your heart  
Please let me make a brand new start  
How crazy  
I had sometimes been  
I hurt you so badly  
But now I feel the pain  
Next time I'll know better  
I'll have more time for you  
I'll listen to your heart  
Just like you asked me to  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
Forgive my many faults  
And the foolish things I've done  
I was so insensitive  
And I didn't understand  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to break your heart  
Please let me make a brand new start


Calling, calling all angels, oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
  
The night was still, the moon was bright when he saw a distant light  
So he started walkin' till he found a church outside of town  
And he stumbled in and closed the door, said why I'm here, I'm not sure  
It's my baby that I'm lookin' for, can't she see I'm down on my knees  
  
I've been calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, tell me what to do, I know she's one of you  
I'm down on my knees, tell her please, that I love her so  
  
Tell me preacher, man to man, will you do all that you can  
I've done wrong, this I know, and I really hurt her so  
It's a lonely world I'm livin' in, an ocean of tears I been cryin'  
In this greatest hour of need, what can be done for a fool like me  
  
Oh, I'm calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, yes I've been a fool  
And I know that she's one of you, now do this for me, tell her please  
  
And if she's lonely I'll make her understand  
That these arms can carry both of us back to heaven again  
  
Yes I've been a fool and I know that she's one of you  
Do this for me, tell her please  
  
Calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels


I thought it was forever  
I thought it would last  
Gotta try to make it  
A page of my past  
You didn't even say goodbye  
When you slammed that door  
  
Now I'm lyin' here alone  
In what once was our bed  
Trying to forget  
All the cruel words you said  
All the radio was playing  
What once was our favorite song  
  
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore  
I'm picking myself up off the floor  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
Gonna dress up in my finest  
Clothes that I own  
And take it to the streets  
I won't be lonely for long  
Gonna put on my best moves  
On every single woman I see  
  
Now you thought you could break me  
Add me to your list  
Notch me on your gun  
Let me tell you this  
I've got news for you baby  
I don't break that easily  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
I'll be out there on the scene  
Hangin' with my friends  
This world's gonna see  
Me smilin' again  
I'm taking some time  
To erase you from my memory  
  
Don't write any letters  
Don't call me on the phone  
Don't knock on my door  
Cause to you I'm not at home  
I know there's a woman out there  
For a man like me  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore  
I'm picking myself up off the floor  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
Baby, you can't keep a good man down  
Honey, you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down


Somewhere in the mountains......... In northern Alabama  
The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee  
Somewhere in a motel...... Out in Oklahoma  
There's the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night...... The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door...... But she won't give in  
But like every other woman........ She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love....... And goes to sleep again  
  
Carolina......... Dreamin' lonely  
Carolina......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady.....  
That I dream of holding tight.....  
That I kiss and tell goodnight.....  
Carolina....... Mountain dewe  
  
Sometime that next day..... On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer........ Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear........ As those green eyes of Carolina  
And she's waiting with the baby from the love.............. Of the only man to  
Lay her down  
  
Carolina.......... Dreaming lonely  
Carolina.......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight  
Carolina...... Mountain dewe  
Carolina.......... I love you


By now in New York City, there's snow on the ground  
And out in California, the sunshine's falling down  
And, maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights  
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Christmas in Dixie, it's snowin' in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight  
  
It's windy in Chicago. The kids are out of school  
There's magic in Motown. The city's on the move  
In Jackson, Mississippi, to Charlotte, Caroline  
And all across the nation, it's the peaceful Christmas time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And from Fort Payne, Alabama  
God bless why'all...We love ya...Happy New Year...Good night  
Merry Christmas...Merry Christmas tonight


All my friends are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays  
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways  
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm  
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
[Chorus:]  
We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow  
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow  
I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart  
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart  
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree  
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms


It's that time of year when the whole world is heart tot heart  
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere  
  
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing  
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home  
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces  
Christmas is love  
  
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling  
Christmas is love, hear the church bells ring  
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving  
Christmas is love  
  
We all gather 'round, watch the lights dancing on the tree  
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air  
  
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing  
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home  
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces  
  
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling  
Christmas is love, just hear the church bells ring  
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving  
Christmas is love, Christmas is love, Christmas is love


It was almost Christmas time  
There I stood in another line  
Tryin to buy that last gift or two  
Not really in the Christmas mood  
  
Standin right in front of me  
Was a little boy waiting anxiously  
Pacing round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes  
  
And his clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven love  
As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me  
What Christmas is all about  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight


  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning  
To listen to the clear ringing bells  
It's tones so sweetly are calling  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There she sleeps close by the church in the valley  
Lies one that I love so well  
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow  
Disturb not her rest in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There close by the site of that loved one  
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom  
When farewell hymns shall be chanted  
I shall rest by her side in the tomb  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  


Just outside of Austin  
I turned on my radio  
Turned it in to a satellite station  
She was talkin' on a call-in show  
She said it was over, she'd made her choice  
Her mind was made-up by the sound of her voice  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Sounded like he really had it coming  
All the times he'd done her wrong  
She said, I hope he's listening  
And hung-up the telephone  
All of a sudden, I realized  
It was me she was telling good-bye  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Hello DJ, put me on the air  
Give me the chance to tell her I still care  
Get her back on the line, tell her I'm still in love  
Said, "sorry son, but you're breaking up"  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Across America tonight  
  
Across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight


Clear water blues, thinkin' of you  
Sittin' here fishin', catchin' a few  
Spendin' my days just tryin' to lose  
These clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues driftin' along  
Nowhere to go, now that you're gone  
My lonely heart don't know what to do  
With these clear water blues  
  
Lookin' out across the ocean  
Blue is all I see  
And it seems like no matter how far I go  
Your memory just won't set me free  
  
Clear water blues won't leave me alone  
Keeps on remindin' me why you're gone  
My reflection is showin' a fool  
In these clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues, still thinkin' of you  
Sittin' here fishin', catchin' a few  
Spendin' my days just tryin' to lose  
These clear water blues  
These clear water blues


Sometimes her morning coffee's way too strong  
And sometimes what she says she says all wrong  
But right or wrong she's there beside me  
Like only a friend would be  
And that's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Now she's been known to wear her pants too tight  
And drinking puts her out just like a light  
Heaven know's she's not an angel, but she'd really like to be  
And that's close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she don't have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Don't you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
'Cause she's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Well sometimes she gets down and starts to cry  
But then again a lady has a right  
She's everything I ever wanted, she's all I'll ever need  
She's close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she don't have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Don't you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
'Cause she's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Oh, she's close enough to perfect for me


You can have your buildings and your arithmetic  
I don't need no crowded streets or city slicker tricks  
I just need to be some place where I can move around  
Look down at my toes and I can still see the ground  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Goin' down to the fishing pond where I can throw the line  
It don't' matter what fish I catch I only came to rest my mind  
The only fish you'll get down town ain't caught with a hook and sinker  
Put on your brakes, beep beep, honk your horn look out now turn on your
blinker  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
I was born in Georgia town with a lack-a-daisy street  
A laid back lover just a-playin' games and a-stayin' off of them feet  
Nobody trying to get on your nerves, nobody tryin' to get what you've got  
And just live and let live by the golden rule now don't it just hit the spot  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side


Written by randy owen, teddy gentry, and greg fowler  
Well the magic attic's where the music rolls  
And the army-navy's got ol' jackie soul  
Down on peaches corner there are good ol' boys  
And mother fletchers makin' lots of noise  
They're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well the tams are playin' at the port-o-call  
And the drifters underneath the boardwalk  
At the sapnish galleon and ol' fat jacks  
Jukebox playin' and the place is packed  
You bet they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
You know they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Got the top down and the traffic's slow  
Sun fun week and, we all go  
Where the girls are sunnin' and lookin' good  
Well i never met 'em but i wish i could  
And we'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
We'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well the embers singin' up on ocean drive  
And the castaways are gettin' loud tonight  
At the electric circus they all getin' down  
And the carousel's spinnin' round and 'round  
See them dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
I see 'em dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well i'm hangin out down at sloppy joes  
They may doze but they never close  
And the bama boys at the bowery  
They can't dance but they play for free  
But they like dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
They know dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
They wrote dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard


I was raised in the shadows of an old cotton mill  
Back when believin' was the style  
Small town heaven and a big-eyed boy  
Made sweet music for a while  
My daddy worked hard down at the factory  
Nights he went to G.I. school  
He didn't know nothin' 'bout the silver spoon  
But he lived by the golden rule  
  
Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home  
Out on the front porch swing  
Wishin' on the stars in the southern sky  
And sometimes we used to sing  
  
We were leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
Got my real education from the T.V. station  
And good ole boys down at the park  
The say "Hey, Willie" and those rock-a-billies  
Made their way into my heart  
  
I remember the old folks sittin' 'round talkin'  
On laidback Sunday afternoons  
They said them young folks sure got a hard road  
Oh, they're growin' up too soon  
  
Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight  
Out on the front porch swing  
The stars are shinin' in my young boy's eyes  
Just like they did for me  
  
We are leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
We are leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of


I'm not a stranger to passion,  
I've seen a lot of love in my time  
Felt that physical attraction,  
From the touch in the heat of the night  
Been all over the country,  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done,  
there's only one that remains  
  
[Chorus]  
Dixie fire burning down in my soul  
Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction,  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse,  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music,  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold,  
And added a warm melody  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning (Cant you see that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning (There's a Dixie fire)  
Burn, burn, burning (Don't you know that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning


Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee bighway  
One arm on the wheel  
Holding my lover with the other  
A sweet soft southern thrill  
Worked hard all week  
Got a little jingle  
On a Tennessee Saturday night  
Couldn't feel better  
I'm together with my dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin' her up tight  
Make a little lovin'  
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night  
It's my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Whitetail buck deer munchin' on clover  
Red-tailed hawk sitting on a limb  
Chubby ol' groundhog  
Croakin' bullfrog  
Free as a feeling in the wind  
Home grown country girl  
Gonna give me a whirl  
On a Tennessee Saturday night  
Lucky as a seven  
Livin' in Heaven  
With my dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin' her up tight  
Make a little lovin'  
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night  
It's my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin' her up tight  
Make a little lovin'  
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night  
It's my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee bighway  
One arm on the wheel


Gonna lay down my burdens, down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
Gonna lay down my burdens, down by the riverside  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more  
  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more  
  
Gonna meet my dear mother, down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
Gonna meet my dear mother, down by the riverside  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more  
  
Gonna meet my dear father, down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside

Just off of the beaten path  
A little dot on a state road map  
That's where I was born and where I'll die  
Things move at a slower pace  
Nobody's in the rat race  
And these days that's a special way of life  
  
[Chorus]  
Down home, where they know you by name  
And treat you like family  
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake  
Are all you need  
Folks know if they're falling on hard times  
They can fall back on  
Those of us raised up down home  
  
In the corner of the hardware store  
Gathered 'round a checkerboard  
Old men telling lies and crowning kings  
Kids driving 'round the old town square  
Tops rolled down in the cool night air  
Go and see what's shaking at the Dairy Queen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place  
But now I want to see my children raised down home, down home  
  
Folks know if they're falling on hard times  
They can fall back on  
Those of us raised up...  
  
[Chorus]


She sits and stares out the window at the water  
Every night down at [Incomprehensible] Cafe  
All alone she sips her pina colada  
Talkin' to herself, dreamin' time away  
The story is that a dark haired stranger  
Stole her heart many years ago  
He promised her, he'd come back and take her  
Around the world, bring her hills of gold  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Each afternoon as the snug boats come in  
She runs to meet them down at the pier  
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset  
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears  
She stands there lookin' at the crystal blue water  
And in the coral she imagines pearls  
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China  
Then the water swirls, the blue-green water swirls  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Young sailors make a play to take her home  
She says, "No, I'm already taken"  
Oh, they just laugh when she mentions his name  
She just keeps on waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key yeah yeah  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key yeah yeah  
Down on Longboat Key  


Down on the river, it's an easy kind of life  
Everybody here's feeling fine  
No need to worry or get in a hurry  
Nothing to spend but time  
  
Light up a smoke and tell a few jokes  
And pass the old jug around  
We're gonna get right on a Saturday night  
When the sun goes down  
  
Down on the river, down on the river  
Just some old boys a making a lot of noise  
Down on the river, down on the river, down on the river  
If anyone calls tell them, we're all down on the river  
  
Well, we'll go fishing by the light of the moon  
And bait them hooks by hand  
Early in the morning take them off the line  
Fry 'em all up in a pan  
  
We gotta get home while we still got a job  
Or we'll have to answer to the man  
And everybody knows we gotta go  
We'll be back again  
  
Down on the river, down on the river


Down this road there's an old brick house  
My mama cried the day that I moved out  
And my first summer job was pumpin' gas and fixin' flats  
But at Henry Walker's Texaco  
Down this road, down this road  
  
Down this road there's a maple tree  
In a cotton field where Jenny first kissed me  
And I can still remember the night she said good-bye  
I stood there like a fool and watched her go  
Down this road, down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road there's a small white church  
Daddy lived his life by the preacher's word  
He raised me right, I could always feel his love  
Even when the angels called him home  
Down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road  
Down this road  
Down this road


Thinking of the faces I've seen  
Back when I was young and green  
I was falling back then  
Now I'm workin' on building a fire  
And flirtin' with that ol' desire  
And fallin' again into the wind  
I fall in love again, I'm fallin' again  
Well you'd think that I would learn by now  
To keep from falling somehow  
But I'm fallin' again  
'Cause when I caught that look in your eyes  
That's when I realized  
I was fallin' again into the wind  
I fall in love again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin' again into the wind  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin' again into the wind


Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
  
Outside on a blanket in the moonlight, it feels right with my arns around you
tight.  
Laying under heaven watching the stars okay while me and you and mother  
Nature drift away.  
  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
Take me away, away.


Whisper to me softly, breathe words upon my skin  
No one's near and listening, so please don't say goodbye  
Just hold me close and love me, press your lips to mine  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Lying here beside you I hear the echoes of your sighs  
Promise me you'll stay with me and keep me warm tonight  
So hold me close and love me, give my heart a smile  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high  
You're loving me so easy, you're wish is my command  
Just hold me close and love me, tell me it won't end  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Feels so right.  
  
Ah, you feel so right baby...


He was a stranger in a little town  
She was sittin' alone in a crowd  
Listening to the old jukebox playin' a song  
From the moment we walked through the diner door  
She felt something like never before  
A feelin' so strong right from the start  
It wouldn't stop - it was more than a spark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each others eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire just won't die  
  
It was gettin' late but they had all night  
They sat there talkin' 'bout their lives  
He was sellin', she uas gettin' ready to buy  
That ole neon light was glowin' dim  
But he could see by the way she was lookin' at him  
Tonight would be different, somethin' had changed  
His lonely heart was feelin' a flame  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
[Bridge]  
She needed him, he needed her  
And they both knew, without a word  
There was no question, there was no doubt  
There was no way they could put it out  
  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each other's eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire, fire on fire  
Fire on fire just won't die  
  
Tag  
Fire on fire  
Just won't die  
Fire on fire


There are people in this country who work hard every day  
Not for fame or fortune do they strive  
But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay  
And it's time a few of them were recognized  
Hello Detroit auto workers, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line  
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin', a-just to send it on down the line  
This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail  
Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale  
Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields  
In the city streets and the quiet country towns  
Working together like spokes inside a wheel  
They keep this country turning around  
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin',a-just to send it on down the line  
Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line  
This is for the one who drives the big rig, up and down the road  
Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load  
Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine  
Hello America let me thank you for your time  


Just punched the clock and boy, am I ready?  
Walkin' out the door headin' home  
It's time to buckle up again in my rolling hunk of tin  
It's quittin' time the evenin' race is on  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Oh, Bubba's runnin' right on my bumper  
Pushin' me but there's no where to go  
Lane changin' left and right, blowin' horns and blinkin' lights  
Oh, the fast lane has never been so slow  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Well, the caution is out we're at a stand still  
Heard there's construction up ahead  
Won't be long so they say, soon we'll all be on our way  
Some trucker on the CB just said  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500 every day  
Every day, every day, every day  
Five o'clock 500  


My dad was a big man with a will that was tough  
He was at his best when the going was rough  
He made a living for the family and never had to cheat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer  
Cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat  
We had food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We picked the cotton and gathered the corn  
We were taught to work from the day we were born  
Mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
When you sit down at the table thank god in prayer  
If you've got plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
If you've got patches on your britches just be sure to keep em neat  
If you've got food on the table and shoes on your feet


I'll admit I could feel it  
The first time that we touched  
And the look in your eyes  
Said you felt as much  
  
But I'm not a man  
Who falls too easily  
It's best that you know  
Where you stand with me  
  
[Chorus]  
I will give you my heart  
Faithful and true  
And all the love it can hold  
That's all I can do  
'cause I've thought about  
How long I'll love you  
And it's only fair that you know  
Forever's as far as I'll go  
  
When there's age around my eyes  
And gray in your hair  
And it only takes a touch  
To recall the love we've shared  
  
I won't take for granted  
You'll know my love is true  
'cause each night in your arms  
I'll whisper to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tag  
Forever's as far as I'll go


Wish I had just one more chance to hold you close and say I love you.  
Can't believe out romance was just beginning. Now its Through.  
I'm looking for tomorrow to start a newlife on my own.  
And all I see is sorrow. You're all I lived for. Now you're gone.  
I can't seem to get you off my mind no matter what I do.  
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes, but the tears keep fallin' through.  
The hardest thing that love has put me through is gettin' over you, gettin'  
Over you, over you, over you.  


Life ain't all that easy I can testify to that  
It's been up and down and round and round to get to where I'm at  
If you could see how I'm living in this old car I drive  
Well you'd probably wonder and even ponder why I even want to stay alive  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I could complain about taxes or the weather we're having today  
Go on and on about things that are wrong from New York to L.A.  
Well that's just not my nature to sit around feeling sad  
We're only here for awhile so why not smile hey living ain't all that bad  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
When I look around there's lots of folks worse off than me  
So I just thank the good Lord and ask him please  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
Give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Give me one more day  
Show me the way and give me one more day  
Give me one more shot


Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?  
  
How can I put into words what I feel?  
My life was complete, I thought I was whole  
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?  
Never knew that love could feel like this,  
And you changed my world with just one kiss.  
How can it be that right here with me there's an angel?  
It's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
In all of creation, all things great and small  
You are the one that surpasses them all  
More precious than any diamond or pearl  
They broke the mold when you came in this world  
And I'm trying hard to figure out just how I ever did without  
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child  
That's deep inside, leaves me purified  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
Never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you change my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, is just a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
God must have spent a little more time on you


[Chorus]  
Gonna have a party, a rockin' little jamboree.  
Gonna have a party. Come on along with me.  
Gonna have a good time, ev'rybody's feelin' right.  
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.  
  
Well, thought I'd call you early,  
I thought you'd like to know there's gonna be a party, and I'd love for you to
go.  
I just want to give you time to get your story right.  
There's gonna be a party, babe, and it might last all night.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're gonna play some music, and we can sing along.  
And I'll bet before the night is through, we'll play your favorite song.  
And when they play the slow dance and I'm holding you so tight, that's when
the party's startin', babe, and it might last all night.  
  
[Chorus]


Before I fly and wave goodbye  
I say to you "days with you are the best years of my life"  
But if I don't see you anymore  
Keep my words safely stored  
And i'll be back I promise once more  
  
Chorus:  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Till I see you again  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
  
Remember me 'cause I care  
Where you are and how you fare  
Get in touch if the wind blows in your face  
I guess it's been too much fun  
We've shared and we've won  
Yes the best is yet to come  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
That one word hurts so bad  
You leave the best you've had  
But you keep the faith and pray to return  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye

Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all  
Let me remember the things I've done  
Walk on the log where the catfish bite  
Walking along the river road at night  
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight  
I can hear the bullfrog calling me, "Ribbit"  
Wonderin' if my rope's still hangin' to the tree  
Ole Brody Junior took me over  
Said, "You're gonna find a well that's colder  
If I'm a bad boss, give some O'Green river", well  
Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all  
Let me remember the things I've done  
Walk on the log where the catfish bite  
Walking along the river road at night  
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight  
Well  


I live to work and work to live  
Oh but what i wouldn't give  
For a ray of sun and a little piece of beach  
Where the sand dollar is the only currency  
  
[Chorus:]  
I vote we go to the gulf of mexico  
You and me by the sea  
Palm trees call me, oh that's the place i want to be  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
Right at five o'clock today  
I'll pick you up, we'll drive away  
And i can't wait to feel the sand beneath my toes  
And i can almost see the sunburn on your nose  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
Vamos we go... (repeat chorus again)  
Tag  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
That's the place i want to be  
  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico


Snowy days and frosty night, everything looks cold and white  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe  
  
Christmas day will soon be here, and everybody's full of cheer  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear  
  
Well, I've waited all year long and nore the year is almost gone  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe  
  
But if that's what I've gotta do just to get a kiss from you  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear  
  
Christmas is a special time to give and to receive  
For every little kiss you give me I will give you three  
  
You ain't gonna miss one kiss, that's one thing you'll never miss  
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe waitin' for you dear  
  
Well, I've had my eyes on you for a long, long time  
So, I'm asking Santa please, make that pretty girl mine  
  
Waited till I'm cold and blue just to get a kiss from you  
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear  
  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear


I've been goin' around in a whirlwind not knowing which way to go.  
I've been lost in a jungle of heartaches looking for what I don't know  
I've spread my wings and I've done some things that I never meant to do.  
Its took me some time but I've made up my mind, I'm hanging up my travelin
shoes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hangin' up my travelin shoes.  
My runnin' around is all through.  
I'm foldin' my wings up for you.  
I'm hangin' up my travelin' shoes.  
  
I've been ridin' a sea of uncertainty, runnin' away fom is all.  
I've listened to nothing that life had to tell me,  
Watched all my dreams rise and fall.  
I've made my mistakes, but it's not too late to pull myself out of the blues.  
Its took me some time but I've made up my mind, I'm hanging up my travelin
shoes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hangin' up travelin' shows.


Happy birthday, Jesus, it's that time of year  
All the lights on the trees say Christmas time is near  
Another year's behind us, you helped us make it through  
So, happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you  
  
We all get so hung up on material things at times it seems like we forget  
What Christmas really means  
It should be thanks we're givin', that's why I wrote this tune  
Happy birthday, Jesus, this sing is just for you  
  
There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree  
No, it's not much, but I hope you like this song to you from me  
  
Happy birthday Jesus, that's why I wrote this tune  
So, happy birthday, Jesus, my song is just for you


Smilin' faces on city streets, crowded shoppers, busy feet  
And every smile just seems to say, we're having some happy holidays  
  
Twinklin' lights on Christmas trees, kids up on santa's kneww  
Busy lines on telephones, sending a merry Christmas home  
  
Bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air  
Up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true  
  
A choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear  
Rudolph with his glowin' nose, lovers under mistletoe  
  
Postman bringin' Christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard  
Frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows  
  
Sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky  
Boys and girls at the big parade to see st. nick up on his sleigh  
  
The scene is set, it's beautiful, sounds of peace, joy and love  
From all of us we'd like to say, have yourself some happy holidays


The stage is set tonight down in Nashville  
It's been a long, hard ride into town  
And thanks to some cowboys and heros  
My chance to sing has finally come around  
  
The first song I ever sang was haggard  
Momma sang to me I saw the Light  
I'd turn my radio up louder  
To hear Johnny Cash walk the line  
  
Waylon sang a song about Texas  
Willie's "Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain"  
Bocephus sings a song about dixie.  
Lefty taught us all how to sing.  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Riding some where tonight  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
Charlie ran the devil out of Georgia  
Skynyrd sang sweet home Alabam  
The Ahlman brothers taught us how to ramble  
And to Tucker boys showed us how to jam.  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Riding some where tonight  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
The stage is set tonight up in Heaven  
Rebas band is there with Patsy Cline  
And all around are cowboys and cowgirls  
And thanks to them the music's still alive  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive


Well, I was feeling kinda lonely, just a little bit blue  
All I wanted was someone to talk to  
I wasn't looking for love or a do romance  
I had no intention of taking that big chance  
Until she walked in, in that low-cut dress  
She was a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead, ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, I ought a know better, you think I'm learned  
But if you're gonna chase fire, you're gonna get burned!  
Yeah, I was still gettin' over the hurtin' from the one before  
She walked in right through that ballroom door  
I ain't never been one to settle for second best  
I want a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead, ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket, Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket on a Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket, Heartbreak Express


Here we are, once again  
Stronger now than we have ever been  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Now we made it through the hardest part  
We had to break it all down to build it back up  
Lean on each other when the times got rough  
How we survive going through so much  
Baby you and I could write a book about love  
Here we are, one to one  
Looking back to see how far we come  
We shared it all, you and I  
We're still together after all this time  
We had to break it all down to build it back up  
Lean on each other when the times got rough  
How we survive going through so much  
Baby you and I could write a book about love  
Here we are, once again  
We're stronger now than we have ever been  
With hand in hand, with heart to heart  
Here we are, here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are

Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When I saw you walking down the street  
I said that's the kind of girl I'd like to meet  
She's so pretty, Lord she's fine. I'm gonna make her mine all mine  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away, that's when I want to say now  
Come on baby give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away, that's when I wanna say  
Come on baby give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl


We didn't know the times were lean,  
Round our house the grass was green,  
It didn't seem like things were all that bad,  
  
I bet we walked a thousand miles,  
Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
When Sunday mornings rolled around,  
We dressed up hand-me-downs,  
Just in time to gather with the church,  
Some times I think how long It's been,  
And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
Walkin' in High Cotton


Why should I feel discouraged?  
And why should the shadows come?  
And why should my heart be lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When Jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is He  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I am free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
Let not your heart be troubled  
His tender word I hear  
And resting on His goodness  
I lose my doubts and fears  
  
Though by the path He leads us  
But one step I may see  
His eye is on the sparrows  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
And I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me


Atlanta, Georgia made her the Cotton Queen  
L.A. bound she had visions of the silver screen  
But Hollywood ain't nothin' but glamor and lights  
To a blue-eyed blond with stars in her eyes  
Her days are long. Lord, her nights are longer yet  
Tryin' to find a part that will make her the Queen of sex  
She's realizing what it's all about from too many nights upon the casting
couch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hollywood: parties and thrills  
The mansion in her mind is somewhere is Beverly Hills  
She's been discovered too many times standing on the corner of Hollywood and
Vine  
  
She makes her entrance now a days through the swingin' doors  
She found her stage on a hardwood barroom floor  
But it's not the bottom, just part of a long, hard fall  
Her biggest fan's the man. Tonight she'll give her all  
The dream is dyin' of her name on the marquee  
The folks back home wonder what happened to their Queen  
The mornin' papers told it in black and white, calling it another Hollywood
suicide  
  
[Chorus:]


I'm gonna call up my boss and tell him I'm ill  
Gonna tell him I'm home, with the fever and chills  
I don't usually lie but for your sweet love I will, I need it so  
  
We won't be disturbed, the phone's off the hook  
And when it comes to lovin' woman, you wrote the book  
And I just saw that 'I want you' look and that's all it took, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Well, the boys at the plant are punching the clock  
If they could see us darlin', oh, what a shock  
They'd do the same if they had what I got  
So please don't stop, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today


I've rehearsed this day a thousand times  
I've played this scene out in my mind  
You spread your wings, you need to fly  
It breaks my heart to say goodbye  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go  
  
My mind goes back to memories  
Of pony rides upon my knee  
First day of school, your brand new bike  
And football games on Friday nights  
And through the years I've watched you grow  
And I love you enough to let you go  
  
Don't look back when you drive away  
I don't want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
You've never seen your daddy cry  
  
So many things I want to say  
You'll meet new friends, you'll be okay  
I'll pray for you out on your own  
But don't forget your way back home  
And though I may not let it show  
I love you enough to let you go  
  
Don't look back when you drive away  
I don't want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
You've never seen your daddy cry  
  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go


I lay out some paper, I take out my pen  
Turn on my table lamp and here I go again  
It's time to write a letter, I'm in the mood tonight  
Gotta find a way to tell you how I feel inside  
  
So I write a little,  
And I cry a little  
It's so hard to find a way  
To say goodbye a little  
But somewhere in the middle  
My emotions interfere  
So I write it a little,  
And cry a little tear  
And I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
  
God I miss you  
Can't be with you  
I would kiss you oh so good  
'Cause you're my only cure for lonely  
I'd call if I could  
  
Well I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
Wishing you were here  
Well I'm writing a little,  
And wishing you were here  
And I write a little,  
And I cry a little tear  
And I'm writing,  
And wishing you were here


Your love for me is gone  
But my love for you lives on  
And my memories of you  
Will never die  
  
I can just see you now  
The special smile you gave to me  
The face I'll love eternally  
I see all the things you do  
  
Your nearness seems so real to me  
As though you really care with me  
Can't believe it's just a memory  
I can just see you now  
  
Oh, girl if I only could  
I wish with all my heart I could  
Holding you would feel so good  
If I could just see you now  
  
I can just feel you now  
The tender sweetness of your lips  
As they brush across my fingertips  
I feel the softness on your mind  
  
So warm beside through the night  
Holding you to the morning light  
Oh, did you really say goodbye  
I can just feel you now  
  
Oh, girl if I only could  
I wish with all my heart I could  
Holding you would feel so good  
If I could just see you now  
  
I could just see you now  
The special smile you gave to me  
The face I'll love eternally  
I see all the things you do


If I Had You  
Alabama  
Album: For The Record  
  
If I had you we'd run like gypsies in the wind  
We'd be lovers and we'd be friends, if I had you  
If I had you we'd count the stars all one by one  
We'd make love till they were gone oh, if I had you  
  
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul  
The flame keeps growin' stronger  
'Cause there ain't no control  
And there's nothing, no there's nothing  
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do, if I had you  
  
If I had you, we'd sail the seven seas as one  
We'd never say it can't be done, oh, if I had you  
  
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul  
The flame keeps growin' stronger there ain't no control  
And there's nothing, oh, there's nothing  
I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do, if I had you  
If I had you...


Oh I love those Colorado Rockies  
And that big starry Montana sky  
And the lights of San Francisco  
On a California night  
Enjoyed those ballgames in Chicago  
On those windy afternoons  
It' s a big beautiful country  
But I' m never home too soon  
If it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
  
If it ain' t Dixie it don' t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I' ve had good times  
North of the line  
I' ve got a lot of good friends too  
But if it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
It won' t do  
  
When the leaves turn in New England  
I love the chill that' s in the air  
I' ve walked the New York City sidewalks  
Had a big time in Times Square  
But now my wheels are rollin' southward  
And heaven' s comin' into view  
Home-sweet-home is Alabama  
That' s what I look forward to  
  
If it ain' t Dixie it don' t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I' ve had good times  
North of the line  
I' ve got a lot of good friends too  
If it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
It won' t do  
  
If it ain' t Dixie  
Oh no, Oh no-whoah  
  
Now my wheels are rollin' southward  
And heaven' s comin' into view  
Home-sweet-home is Alabama  
That' s what I look forward to  
  
Y' all come to Dixie...


If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
That lead guitar is hot,  
But not for "lousiana man".  
So rosin up that bow for "faded love"  
And let's all dance.  
If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
  
I remember down in houston  
We were puttin' on a show  
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled,  
"cotton-eyed joe"!  
He said, "we love what you're doin'.  
Boys don't get us wrong,  
There's just somethin' missin' in your song.  
  
Chorus  
  
So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight.  
Them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case.  
You say y'all all wanna two-step. You say ya wanna doe-si-doe.  
Well, here's a fiddlin' song before we go.  
  
Chorus  
Repeat and fade


Chorus:  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really got to do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
Don't know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
It's not new, but it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2  
  
Chorus  
  
Can't be late  
That leaves me plenty of time  
Shakin' hands with the clock  
I can't stop, I'm on a roll and ready to rock  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear a voice  
It says I'm runnin' behind  
I better pick up my pace  
It's a race and there ain't no room  
For someone in second place  
  
Break  
  
Chorus  


I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
Don't know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
It's not new  
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2  
  
Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
Can't be late  
I leave plenty of time  
Shaking hands with the clock  
I can't stop  
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock  
  
Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
I hear a voice  
That say's I'm running behind  
I better pick up my pace  
It's a race  
And there ain't no room  
For someone in second place.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why


There's something sexy 'bout the way you're dressed  
I can see you're lookin' your best tonight, that's right  
You're walkin' with a new attitude  
There's something different 'bout the way you're movin' tonight, that's right  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
It's been a while since we've been out  
It's overdue baby ain't no doubt you know, ain't it so  
It's feelin' like our first date  
To tell the truth now honey I can't wait to go  
And I think you know  
Well tonight it's just us two and baby I want you  
  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
I'm in that kind of mood  
I'm in that kind of mood  
I'm in that kind of mood


I knock off with a lot on my mind  
From a long hard day  
Pull in at home, see you and find  
My stress slipping away  
Then you run to my arms  
and give me a kiss  
And nothing else matters  
When you hold me like this  
  
(Chorus)  
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man  
To win your heart all over again  
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste  
Nothing but you  
I'm in the mood to close the door  
Make love tonight like never before  
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore  
Girl, I'm in the mood  
All day long I'm so strong  
Then I hear you speak  
I'm drawn to your fire, your signs of desire  
Girl, you make me weak  
I go drifting away  
Like a leaf in the wind  
I'm under a spell  
Your touch put me in  
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man  
To win your heart all over again  
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste  
Nothing but you  
Yeah, I'm in the mood to close the door  
Make love tonight like never before  
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore  
Girl, I'm in the mood


We used to get crazy ev'ry Saturday night  
We'd drive into town and get feelin' right  
A child of the sixties in seventy four  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
Well I burned the tires off my chevrolet  
Tryin' to impress the girls that I date  
And I'd bet a gambler when I couldn't score  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not that way anymore  
Time's closin' yesterday's door  
But I'm just as happy as I was before  
Cause I'm not that way anymore  
  
American bandstand, the sullivan show  
I listened to the opry on my ra--dee---I--o  
Well dick clark's still lookin' as young as before  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
Well I swapped my loafers for cowboy boots  
Bought me some jeans gave away all my suits  
My razor is rusted, my barber is poor  
'Cause I'm not that way anymore  
  
I'm not that way anymore  
We're not that way anymore


I know people who lose their lover turn around and they find another  
Fall in love and then they break up I don't know if I want to wake up  
Cause I'm still dreamin' I'm still dreamin' baby  
I'm still dreamin' oh oh oh about you  
Other women walk right up to me I hear them talking but it goes right through
me  
I know it's love that's on the line but they don't know what's on my mind  
Cause I'm still dreamin'...  
It's like a voice that's always calling it's like a feelin' that I'm always
falling  
I close my eyes and all I see is you you you  
Cause I'm still dreamin'...  
I'm still dreamin'...  
  


Sittin' here and rinkin'. Hey that's my fav'right song.  
What's that that Ihear ringin'? Would someone get the phone?  
Wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
Our love, a fadin mem'ry as I chase another down.  
My eyes are gettin' heavy and my head's spinnin' 'round.  
Stil wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned.  
Closing time, I drive for home not feelin' any pain.  
Thoughts of her drift back tome through the fallin' rain.  
Not caring if she ever come shome.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
  


[Chorus]  
In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox  
It's playing all my favorite memories  
One by one they take me back  
To the days when you were mine  
And i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
I don't need no quarters  
Don't need any dimes  
You filled it up forever  
When you said goodbye  
Heaven knows i love old melodies  
They were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Song by song those melodies  
Were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tag  
No i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
[Chorus]


Katy brought my guitar back today  
I left it there to play when I'd stay over  
And I remember all those nights  
Sittin' in the fireplace light  
How she loved to hear me play  
And Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
I've seen it make her cry over and over  
She told me when I wasn't there  
And she would wake up feelin' scared  
She'd hold it in her arms and be okay  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
We had our stormy times like anybody else  
Oh, more than once I broke her heart  
And when I couldn't tell her I was sorry by myself  
I could tell her with an old guitar  
But I'm afraid this time things have gone too far  
  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
I guess that means this time it's really over  
And as I sit and play it now  
The songs all seem so sad somehow  
I wish that I'd 've left it in the case  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
And I remember all those nights  
Sittin' in the fireplace light  
How she loved to hear me play  
But Katy brought my guitar back today


It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen  
A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams  
The ties that once bound her now are broke away  
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play  
  
She never thought that love could ever end so soon  
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon  
When he asked her to marry and she glady said O.K  
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To a man who would love her and never let her down  
  
Well, I know a lady that's down on her love  
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch  
But work took me a way from home late at nights  
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights  
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust  
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To man who would love her and never let her down  
Now she's a lady down on love


You kiss me awake in the mornin'  
Now what a way to start the day  
With love notes that you leave me  
Written in your own special way  
  
You call me up for nothin'  
I hear your voice on the line  
We start talkin' 'bout lovin'  
You get to me everytime  
  
It's those little things you do that make me love you so  
Little things that only you and I could ever know  
You don't have to lay the whole wide world here at my feel, oh no  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me  
  
Lyin' in the bed beside you  
Touchin' in the middle of the night  
No you don't have to do any talkin'  
To tell me everything is all right  
  
It's those little things you do that make me love you so  
Little things that only you and I will ever know  
You don't have to lay the whole wide world here at my feel, oh no  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me  
  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me


  
Well, you got to walk that lonesome valley  
You got to walk it by yourselves  
Nobody else can walk it for you  
You got to walk it by yourselves  
  
Now mother walked that lonesome valley  
She had to walk it by herself  
Cause nobody else could walk it for her  
She had to walk it by herself  
  
Now father walked that lonesome valley  
He had to walk it by himself  
Nobody else could walk it for him  
He had to walk it by himself  
  
Now John, they say, he was a Baptist  
While others say, he was a Jew  
But the holy bible plainly tells you  
Oh, that he was a preacher too  
  
Yeah, you got to walk that lonesome valley  
You got to walk it by yourselves  
Ain't nobody else gonna go there for you  
You got to go there by yourselves  
  
Yeah, we got to walk that lonesome valley  
We got to walk it by ourselves (by ourselves)  
Cause nobody else (nobody else) can walk it for us  
We got to walk it by ourselves  
  
Yeah, we got to walk (we got to walk)  
That lonesome valley (that lonesome valley)  
We got to walk (we got to walk) it by ourselves (by ourselves)  
Lord, nobody else (nobody else) can walk it for us  
(Can walk it for you)  
We got to walk (we got to walk) it by ourselves  
  
Yeah, we got to walk (we got to walk) it by ourselves  
  


I once thought of love as a prison  
a place I didn't want to be  
So long ago, I made a decision  
to be footloose and fancy-free  
  
But you came and I was so tempted  
to gamble on love just one time  
I never thought, that I would get caught  
It seemed like the perfect crime  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby you left me defense-less  
I've only got one plea  
Lock me away, inside of your love  
and throw away the key  
I'm guilty...of love in the first degree  
  
I thought it would be so simple  
like a thousand times before  
I'd take what I wanted, and just walk away  
but I never made it to the door  
  
Now babe I'm not beggin' for mercy  
go ahead and throw the book at me  
If lovin' you's a crime  
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love in the first degree (oh-oh yeah)  
Love in the first degree  
Oh Yeeeaaaah!  
  
[Chorus]


I don't mind the cold and rain where I'm waiting  
I'm holding on to your mem'ry as tight as I can  
And silver wings are bringing you back so I can hold you  
And let me know that I'm still your lovin' man  
  
You carry my dreams through the darkness while I'm sleeping  
The part of love that I need to fit my plan  
And I don't need nobody else to ease my feelings  
As long as I can be your lovin' man  
  
I been waiting here for days to see that big steel bird arrive  
And just the thought of lovin' you is what's kept this man alive  
  
Share with me all the joy life can bring us  
Though my kingdows may be castles made of sand  
Darlin' please spend your sunshine days beside me  
And let me always be your lovin' man  
  
Your lovin' man (lovin' man)  
And let me be (your lovin' man)  
Your lovin' man (lovin' man)  
And let me be (your lovin' man)  
Your lovin' man (lovin' man)


Once upon a lifetime  
I looked in someone's eyes  
And felt the fire burning in my heart  
For the very first time  
She was scared and young  
And had never tasted love  
So I took her by the hand  
And a boy became a man  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
And once upon a lifetime  
You hold the Queen of Hearts  
And if you gamble on a diamond win  
The dealin' starts  
  
You stand to lose it all  
As the cards begin to fall  
And the lesson learned is hard  
You're only dealt the Queen of Cards  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
  
Once upon a lifetime  
You know that you've been blessed  
When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest  
  
And through the innocence you see  
The value of a family  
And you feel a special bond  
That only comes along  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
And people only find love like yours and mine  
Once upon a lifetime


We live in the land of plenty  
But many things aren't plenty anymore  
Like the water from our sink  
They say's not safe to drink  
  
You gotta go and buy it at the store  
Now we're told there's a hole in the ozone  
Look what's washing on the beach  
And Lord, I believe, from the heavens to the seas  
We're bringing Mother Nature to her knees  
  
[Chorus]  
So let's leave some blue up above us  
Let's leave some green on the ground  
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow  
Leave it and pass it on down  
  
Well there's a change taking place way on the mountains  
Acid rain is falling on the leaves  
And down in Brazil, the fires are burning still  
How we gonna breathe without them trees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place where I live called the Canyon  
Where Daddy taught me to swim  
And that water, it's so pure  
And I'm gonna make sure  
Daddy's grandkids can swim there like him  
  
Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty  
When we look into the eyes of our kids  
'Cause brothers it's a fact, if we take and don't put back  
They'll have to pay for all we did  
  
[Chorus: x 4]  
  
Tag:  
Leave it and pass it on down


Precious memories, flood my soul  
  
Precious memories, unseen angels  
Sent from somewhere to my soul  
How they linger ever near me  
And the sacred past unfolds  
  
Precious father and loving mother  
Fly across the lonely years  
And old home scenes of my childhood  
In fond memories appear  
  
As I travel on life's pathway  
Know not what the years may hold  
As I ponder, hope grows fonder  
Precious memories flood my soul  
  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Echo's from the past I hear  
Old time singing, gladness bringing  
From that lovely land somewhere  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold


Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
Love is reckless  
Let's get reckless tonight  
  
There ain't nothin' out here but a big ol' Texas sky  
There's a red sun painted across the coming night  
Well, your daddy's got plans for you  
and mine thinks I'm at school  
They say it's reckless to chase a dream  
But this town's got nothing for you and me  
  
Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside, baby  
We're gettin out of here.  
I could care less where it leads us  
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight  
  
Let's take my Thunderbird and leave tonight,  
I'll keep the pedal to the floor till we see the morning light.  
They can't live our lives for us,  
If we let them we'll lose our love.  
And love dies hard in this Texas sun,  
I'd rather be reckless and on the run  
  
Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside, baby  
We're gettin out of here.  
I could care less where it leads us  
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight  
  
When you're crazy in love you gotta take a chance,  
Burn the bridge and don't look back.  
  
Turn the radio up roll the windows down  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside,  
Baby we're gettin' out of here  
Roll the windows down.  
Turn the radio up


She can light a fire under me  
Give me all the courage that I need  
She can see a side I just can't see, she can  
  
She can make me smile when I wanna cry  
Find a way to change my state of mind  
She can always reach through my disguise, she can  
  
When my world gets crazy and I just can't cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand, oh, only she can  
  
She can take the chill out of winter nights  
Take away the wrong from what's not right  
She can make the darkest hour look bright, she can  
  
When I really need to make a stand  
But I don't believe in who I am  
When I really want to but I just can't, she can  
  
When my world gets crazy and I just can't cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand, oh, only she can  
  
I try to do for her what she does for me  
'Cause I want our love to grow  
I'm gonna hold on tightly only a fool would let her go  
  
'Cause when my world gets crazy and I just can't cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand, oh, only she can  
  
Yes, she can  
Only she can  
Yes, she can  
Oh, yes, she can [unverified]


There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
It ain't very much but she brings home the bacon and the bread  
  
We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on  
But it seems like all of our money is gone  
Before we get a chance to get ahead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above  
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love  
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed  
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night  
Had to drive it home with one taillight  
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
And she don't sweat the small stuff


It was July hot 'cross Georgia on my way to myrtle beach  
I just got my diploma so I set out in search of me  
The honeymoon was over and Alabama was far away  
From being little more than just a southern state  
  
I got a gig down at the Bowery  
I played for tip and watered drinks  
Just a novice in a business  
That's seldom what it seems  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Where's J.C. and the chosen few?  
I saw the flash without T.Gentry  
And B.V. left for Malibu  
  
I was July, hot and thirty, some years down the line  
When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time  
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too  
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes  
  
But in the Bowery hangs the memories  
Of dreams that still come true  
Every time I see the spotlights  
I'm one of the chosen few  
  
And where are you going tar top  
J.C. and the chosen few  
There's no flash without T.Gentry  
B.V. where are you?  
  
Where are you goin' tar top  
Which direction will you take  
What's this contraband clamor  
About the music that you make?  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Is it country enough?  
Is it contemporary glamor?  
No it's us, just us


I was born across the river in the mountains where I call home.  
Lord, times were good there. don't know why i ever roamed.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Tennessee river and a mountain man, we get together anytime we can.  
Oh, Tennessee river and a mountain man, we play together in mother nature's  
  
Band.  
  
Me and my woman's done made our plans on the Tennessee river, walkin' hand in  
Hand.  
Gonna raise a family, lord settle down where peace and love can still be  
Found.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, Tennessee river.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, Tennessee river.


He stays up at night till way after dark  
Feeding the dog that lives in our yard  
He'll put on my shoes and stumble around  
But together we can catch any outlaw in town  
The boy tries to be just like me  
I'm all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
Mamma's little man and me  
He wants to know how this and that goes  
He'll play all day on a mountain of clay  
And he'll fight with me to show that he's strong  
But if he gets hurt it's mamma he wants  
The boy tries to be just like me  
I'm all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
It's mamma's little man and me  
Some day I know he'll leave us alone  
Break mamma's heart I'll try to be strong  
But if I shed a tear I hope he won't see  
The big man is him and the boy is me  
The boy tried to be just like me  
He's all that I try to be  
Now I'm watching cartoons on my knees  
And mamma's little man is me  
Let's go to bed mamma  


You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
She knows him inside out  
The things he dreams about  
And makes them come true when she can  
She knows all of his faults  
The demons he's fought  
With nothin' but his hard-workin' hands  
  
And he calls out her name  
In passion and pain  
She makes him stronger each time  
Yeah it's there on her lips  
And her fingertips  
That she's with him to 'til end of the line  
  
(Yeah) you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves (yes you can)  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does and she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
He loves  
He always loves


We could walk away now  
Call it over and done  
Say we fought the good fight  
And nobody won  
  
Say we're both better off  
That worse came to worst  
So we didn't last  
Hey, we're not the first  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
And find the love we had back then again  
  
Off to such a good start  
But somehow it seems  
We've let our hearts  
Fall apart at the dreams  
  
We could throw in the towel  
Walk away with our pride  
Say it just wasn't worth  
All the tears that we cried  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Let's find the love we had back then again  
  
Baby, if we want it bad enough  
We can make it better than it ever was  
  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Let's find the love we had back then again


The stakes are high  
We have to seize the chance  
A case of do or die  
This is our last dance  
  
A moment's hesitation and we always pay the price  
Hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
The vision is too real  
The prize is there to take  
We're on an even keel  
No demons in our way  
  
If you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven  
Both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
Yesterday's tomorrow is tomorrow's yesterday  
Find More lyrics at  
Destiny's forgotten, there's another game to play  
No more future perfect we just need the present tense  
All our yesterdays are only hanging in suspense  
  
Hang the banners high  
On the outward walls  
The battles lost and won  
That's when the hammer falls  
  
Racing to the future we must never lose our way  
All we have to do is take tomorrow's chance today  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays have all departed  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone

Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just a humble servant with a message here for you  
Well I know you have good reasons and there's things you've got to do  
But the boatman won't be waiting and he's leaving here with you  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
  
(one more mile, one more road, one last bridge, one less load)  
  
Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just obeying orders, I'm a simple soul like you  
Well you really are persuasive, but I've heard it all before  
And the boatman's getting restless as he stands upon the shore  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
Can't take it with you


The traveler is always leaving town  
He never has the time to turn around  
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere  
He seems to be completely unaware  
  
The traveler is always leaving home  
The only kind of life he's ever known  
When every moment seems to be  
A race against the time  
There's always one more mountain left to climb  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday, you'll know where you are, remember  
  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
The traveler awaits the morning tide  
He doesn't know what's on the other side  
But something deep inside of him  
Keeps telling him to go  
He hasn't found a reason to say no  
  
The traveler is only passing through  
He cannot understand your point of view  
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find  
The traveler in me is close behind  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are


If you believe in the power magic,  
I can change your mind  
And if you need to believe in someone,  
Turn and look behind  
When we were living in a dream world,  
Clouds got in the way  
We gave it up in a moment of madness  
And threw it all away  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done?  
  
If you believe in the power of magic,  
Its all a fantasy  
So if you need to believe in someone,  
Just pretend its me  
It aint enough that we meet as strangers  
I cant set you free  
So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me?  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done?

This golden day will be mine  
For every moment in time  
If time should lose her way  
  
A symphony in the night  
Of stars that dance in the light  
And music far away  
  
They say that love is but a dance  
Don't let the music fade away  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
Without reason or rhyme  
The sweet bouquet of the wine  
Will vanish in the air  
  
The innocence of the rose  
She leaves where she goes  
For all the world to share  
  
Some days when clouds are drifting by  
I open my eyes and watch them go  
And wonder where they fly  
  
Some nights orion runs too fast  
I look to the stars as if to say  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
But soon a golden age is past  
Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise  
Don't let the moment pass


[Verse:]  
Don't think  
Sorry's easily said  
Don't try  
Turning tables instead  
You've taken lots of chances before  
But I ain't gonna give anymore  
Don't ask me  
That's how it goes  
Cause part of me knows what you're thinking  
Don't say  
Words you're gonna regret  
Don't let  
Fire rush to your head  
I've heard the accusation before  
And I ain't gonna take anymore  
Believe me  
The sun in your eyes  
Made some of the lies worth believing  
  
[Chorus 1]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't leave  
False illusions behind  
Don't cry  
I ain't changing my mind  
So find another fool like before  
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing  
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind  
  
[Chorus 3 -Final]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind

What's the use of worrying  
If we'll be here tomarrow  
All we need to be is here today  
Don't care if you're rich  
Or if you have to beg and borrow  
You can always find a way  
Dive and breakaway  
  
Fall free  
Freedom's in the air  
It's calling you  
Your heart is there  
Fall free  
Blaze accross the sky  
The perfect fall  
The perfect high  
  
Mother earth looks peaceful  
As we climb towards the ceiling  
We must be ten thousand feet or more  
Hear the windrush screaming  
While we fight to curb our feelings  
As we stand beside the door  
Let our spirits soar  
  
Fall free  
Freedom's in the air  
It's calling you  
Your heart is there  
Fall free  
Blaze accross the sky  
The perfect fall  
The perfect high

Where do we go from here now that all other children are growin' up  
And how do we spend our lives if there's no-one to lend us a hand  
  
I don't want to live here no more,  
I don't want to stay  
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,  
Quietly fading away  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Are not right  
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,  
Would you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up  
And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn  
  
I don't want to live here no more,  
I don't want to stay  
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,  
Quietly fading away  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Just don't make it right  
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,  
Do you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Are not right  
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,  
Would you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it

Just don't make it right  
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,  
Do you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night


Watching waiting rising falling  
Listening calling drifting  
Touching feeling seeing believing  
Hoping sending leaving  
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini  
If I tried to write a million words a day  
I see your shadow coming closer  
Then watch you drifting away  
  
Watching Waiting rising falling  
Listening calling drifting  
Touching feeling seeing believing  
Hoping Sending leving  
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini  
We are travelling a million worlds away  
I see your Shadow coming closer  
Then watch you drifting away

You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make-up  
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
You don't fool me with your easy lies and fables  
You won't see me in ten buck furs and sables  
You sparkle like a snake  
The wine is real but the glass if fake  
Blame it on the apple tree but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause I wouldn't wanna be like you


Something's wrong in this house today  
While the master was riding the servants decided to play  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
While the sorcerer slept the apprentice decided to play  
While the master was hiding the servants decided to play  
Might be too much sun or too much of something in the air  
Whatever's happening nobody else is aware  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay  


Stealing a moment from Mr. Time  
He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime  
But it's all for show, all for show.  
Wearing your name and a number or two  
When the minute's up, so are you  
But everybody knows, everybody knows.  
Watching the hour from the light in his eyes,  
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky  
But it's lost below, lost below.  
Turning the Wheel of your destiny round,  
When the motion stops no more sound,  
Does anybody care, anybody care.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
Is it a feeling of deja vu?  
When he points his finger calling you  
Is it illusion? Just an illusion  
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet  
He blows them away as rocks on his seat,  
Cool as his smile, his smile.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.


(bairnson)  
  
We say welcome to the mission  
Show us all what you can do  
We need a man with vision  
So we put our trust in you  
And now we hope sincerely  
That you'll do the best that you can do  
  
Oh for sure it won't be easy  
And we will have to risk our lives  
Some will try to break us  
And cut us down to size  
But jsut remember  
There can be no consolation prize  
Not in our eyes  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
Can you hear what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
Although time is getting short  
There's still some sand left in the glass  
And now we have a living breathing  
Rocket man at last  
It's time to take a step  
And nail our colours to the mast  
  
No more talk of great adventures  
When it's movement that we need  
It must be our intention  
That we never loose the lead  
So count us down to zero  
And let's get up to speed  
We're up and away  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
So believe what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
And so now they cry for justice  
As if justice will be done  
But the eye up in the sky  
Was flying to close to the sun  
The challenger has fallen  
And the race has now been run....

Maybe I'm imagining the things they say about me  
Maybe there is really nothing there at all  
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me  
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall  
  
When my back is turned he's up to something else  
And I must not stop believing in myself  
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, talks like you do  
He calls up your number  
And you can't get through somebody out there  
  
Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me  
Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say  
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me  
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, using your name  
Somebody out there, you get the blame  
There's doubt and suspicion  
It's hard to explain somebody out there  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, stolen your base  
Somebody out there, parked in your space  
You've no reservation, he's taken your place  
Somebody out there, wasting your time  
Somebody out there, using your dime  
Your friends think you're crazy  
They're way out of line  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, thinks like you do  
You stare at the mirror  
You're looking into  
Somebody out there

Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
"You've only one shot, get it right", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run


By the last breath of the four winds that blow  
I'll have revenge upon Fortunato  
Smile in his face I'll say "come let us go  
I've a cask of Amontillado"  
  
Sheltered inside from the cold of the snow  
Follow me now to the vault down below  
Drinking the wine as we laugh at the time  
Which is passing incredibly slow  
  
(What are these chains that are binding my arm?)  
Part of you dies each passing day  
(Say it's a game and I'll come to no harm)  
You'll feel your life slipping away  
  
You who are rich and whose troubles are few  
May come around to see my point of view  
What price the Crown of a King on his throne  
When you're chained in the dark all alone  
  
(Spare me my life only name your reward)  
Part of you dies each brick I lay  
(Bring back some light in the name of the Lord)  
You'll feel your mind slipping away


And I could easily fall from grace  
Then another would take my place  
For the chance to behold your face  
  
As the days of my life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
At the call of the wind's command  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
  
All that I ask you  
Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
  
As the sun turns slowly around the sky  
Till the shadow of night is high  
The eagle will learn to fly  
  
As the days of his life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
And vanish upon the land  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
Show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
And so, with no warning, no last goodbye  
In the dawn of the morning sky  
The eagle will rise again

(I) Prelude  
  
"Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless."

The clock struck midnight  
And through my sleeping  
I heard a tapping at my door  
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness  
And so I turned inside once more  
To my amazement  
There stood a raven  
Whose shadow hung above my door  
Then through the silence  
It spoke that one word  
That I shall hear forever more  
Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore  
And still the raven remains in my room  
No matter how much I implore  
No words can soothe him  
No prayer remove him  
And I must hear for evermore  
Quoth the raven, nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven  
Nevermore

One more compromise I won't be making  
One more easy way out I won't be taking  
So many chances don't come twice  
So many eyes are made of ice  
One more cheating hand I won't be shaking  
  
One more substitute I won't be trying  
One more piece of the rock that I'm not buying  
So many times we stand and fight  
So many reasons can't be right  
One more simple truth I'm not denying  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many fools who don't think twice  
Too many ways to pay the price  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
One more sacrifice I won't be making  
One more golden rule I won't be breaking  
No one to let me state my case  
No one to tell me to my face  
One more sweet suprise I won't be faking  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many bridges you can burn  
Too many tables you can't turn  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many games that I can't play  
Too many windmills in my way  
Don't wanna live in the real world

Round your finger  
Token of the love we give one another  
Music of the future that we'll discover  
Promises to keep more than any other  
Symbolising all that we share  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for everyone to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
In a circle  
Living in a world of perpetual motion  
Turning with the tide of a restless ocean  
Spinning on the wheel of your own emotion  
Ridin on a wild carrousel  
You'll be turning round and round  
Round and round we go  
  
Promises, promises, promises, promises  
  
Round your finger  
After all the years we've been together  
Walking in the sun and stormy weather  
Sharing in a moment to last forever  
Memories and dreams without end  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
And it finds you in the darkness of the night  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it guides you when you're blinded by the light  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for all to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
The ring is magic, magic, fire, fire  
The ring is mine


Tell me what to do  
Now the light in my life is gone from me  
Is it always the same  
Is the night never ending  
Tell me what to do  
All the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me  
There's a smile on my face  
But I'm only pretending  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  
Tell me what to do  
Now there's nobody watching over me  
If I seem to be calm  
Well it's all an illusion  
Tell me what to do  
When the fear of the night comes over me  
There's a smile on my face  
Just to hide the confusion  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  


Just what you need to make you feel better  
Just what you need to make you feel  
Just what you need to make you feel better  
Just what you need to make you feel  
  
At the far end of your tether  
And your thoughts won't fit together  
So you sleep light or whatever  
And the night goes on forever  
The your mind change like the weather  
Your in need of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether  
  
Even clouds seem bright and breezy  
'Cause the livin' is free and easy  
See the rat race in a new way  
Like you're walkin' up to a new day  
It's a wise thing if you're clever  
Take a lead from Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether  
  
Find the end of the rainbow  
Fly wherever the winds blow  
Laugh at life like a sideshow  
Just what you need to make you feel better  
  
Satisfaction altogether  
Guaranteed by Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether  
  
Find the end of the rainbow  
Fly wherever the winds blow  
Laugh at life like a slideshow  
Just what you need to make you feel better  
  
Don't stop bringin' the girls round  
Don't start havin' a showdown  
Keep on handin' the jug round  
All that you need is wine and good company


You should have seen him  
Lying alone in helpless silence in the night  
You should have seen him  
You would have seen his eye reflecting in the light  
  
So for the old man  
Ashes to ashes, earth to earth and dust to dust  
No one will see me  
No one with guilt to share, no secret soul to trust  
  
Louder and louder  
Till I could tell the sound was not within my ears  
You should have seen me  
You would have seen my eyes grow white and cold with fear  
  
Heard all the things in Heaven and Earth  
I've seen many things in Hell  
But his vulture's eye of a cold pale blue  
Is the eye of the Devil himself  
  
Take me away now  
But let the silence drown the beating of his heart


The Turn of a Friendly Card (Part 1)  
(Lead vocal - Chris Rainbow)  
There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains  
And a wheel in perpetual motion  
And they follow the races and pay out the gains  
With no show of outward emotion  
And they think it will make their lives easier  
For God knows up till now it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west  
Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise  
And not all's the king's horse and all the king's men  
Have prevented the fall of the unwise  
For they think it will make their lives easier  
And God knows it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine  
As he enters inside the cathedral...


There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chainsAnd a wheel in perpetual

It's almost a feeling you can touch in the air  
You look all around you, but nobody's there  
It's been a long time now since you've been aware  
That somebody's watching you  
  
He's gonna get you  
  
Sooner or later when your big chances come  
You'll look for the catches, but there'll be none  
Remember before you grab the money and run  
That someone is watching you  
  
He's gonna get you.  
  
Before you run and hide  
He's gonna get you  
You got no choice  
'Cause you can't escape the voice  
  
Jumping with shadows that come up from behind  
You're scared of the darkness that's there in your mind  
You're frightened to move because of what you might find  
Someone is watching you  
  
He's gonna get you.  
  
Before you run and hide  
He's gonna get you  
You got no choice  
'Cause you can't escape the voice


An anthem to the human condition  
  
Lead vocal: john miles  
  
What kind of madness rule the world today  
What earthly reason holding sway  
There is no heaven at all  
For some may weep  
And some may sleep  
While some may rise  
And some may fall  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go I  
  
And so we live in lives of fantasy  
And dream of dreams that hold the key  
And we follow like sheep  
We thread the path  
That leads to thee  
We seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go i


Time, flowing like a river  
Time, beckoning me  
Who knows when we shall meet again  
If ever  
But time  
Keeps flowing like a river  
To the sea  
  
Goodbye my love,  
Maybe for forever  
Goodbye my love,  
The tide waits for me  
Who knows when we shall meet again  
If ever  
But time  
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)  
To the sea, to the sea  
  
Till it's gone forever  
Gone forever  
Gone forevermore  
  
Goodbye my friends,  
Maybe forever  
Goodbye my friends,  
The stars wait for me  
Who knows where we shall meet again  
If ever  
But time  
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)  
To the sea, to the sea  
  
Till it's gone forever  
Gone forever  
Gone forevermore

Lyrics by Alan Parsons  
  
You drink the wine  
You play the fool  
You cross the line  
You lose your cool  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
You're on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The end's in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone


Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there is hatred, let me bring Your love,  
Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord,  
And where there's doubt, true faith in You  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring Your light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
For when we give, we will ourselves receive  
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned  
And in dying that we gain eternal life  
And in dying that we gain eternal life


We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below are sleeping as we fly  
  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding in the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Far across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low  
On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
  
And walking in the air  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're walking in the air


But over in a land that's in my back yard  
There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard  
  
Well, they found a way to live with ease  
By eating from the bush instead of the trees  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Path to eternity  
Find you a path and you follow the call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Well, over in a corner, standing there  
Telling my house that they haven't a single care  
  
But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own  
Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone  
  
Apple Bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Find you a path and you buy with a call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Someday like my house you're going to chose too  
If you cut this new path well the old one will do  
and you live with the people who live with ease  
The red apple bush, the blue apple tree


Mommy where's daddy?  
He's been gone for so long.  
Do you think he'll ever come home?  
  
I was gone for fourteen days  
I coulda been gone for more  
Held up in the intensive care ward  
Lyin' on the floor  
I was gone for all those days  
But I, was not all alone  
I made friends with a lot of people  
In the danger zone  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it every day  
See my lonely mind explode  
Since I've gone away  
  
I think I lost some weight there  
And I, I'm sure I need some rest  
Sleepin don't come very easy  
In a straight white vest  
Should like to see that little children  
She's only four years old.. old  
I'd give her back all of her play things  
Even, even the ones I stole  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone insane  
  
I want to get out of here  
I want to get out of here  
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere  
Ya gotta let me out of here  
Let me outta her  
Etc  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
Blown up in my face  
  
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat  
And I, I ran into the street  
I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldn't breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
I'm glad it wasn't me  
But now I hear those sirens callin'  
And so I am not free  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
(I didn't want to be)  
I see it every day  
(Leave me alone  
I didn't want to be  
Don't touch me!)  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone Insane


She struts into the room  
Well I don't know her  
But with a magnifying glance  
I just sorta look her over  
  
We have a drink or two, well maybe three  
And then suddenly, she starts telling me her life story  
  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home  
Cause it's a long long way to paradise  
And I'm still on my own.  
  
Told her that I came from Detroit City  
And I played guitar in a long haired rock and roll band  
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice  
I said 'listen baby, you really wouldn't understand'  
  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On my own,  
  
Oh, baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home,  
Cause it's a long, long way, to paradise,  
And I'm still on my own, own


I wish I could tell you something you didn't know  
I wish I could give you something you didn't owe  
I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
I just want to take you somewhere you haven't been  
Find an old time movie where we don't know the end  
Lost in the radio, drive another mile  
So I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Tired of serious conversation  
Tangled up in situations  
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you....


Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
I guess I'm a loner and I don't fit in (No...)  
I ain't too comfortable in my skin (oh...)  
An' I don't play well with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
  
Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
Nobody wants me hanging round  
Unless it's from a tree in the middle of town  
And I'm out of step with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
So I defy maybe all rules maybe no rules  
  
My clothes don't make me  
My hair ain't cut right  
And I don't care much  
No I don't care at all  
  
I guess my brain is out of synch, I think  
  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide, I just can't decide  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Aw...


I'm lazy, you know it  
I'm ready for the second show  
Amazin', thing growing  
Just waitin' for the juice to flow  
  
But you're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
Tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul  
  
I'm hurting, I'm wanting  
I'm aching for another go  
You're squirming wet, baby  
Nothin' bad comin' very slow  
And it's burnin' holes in me  
  
You're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
It tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul... whoa-oh  
  
One spastic explosion  
Two pressure-cookers go insane  
It makes me act crazy  
I shiver but I love this game  
  
You're so very ordinary  
You're so very lame  
Tastes like whiskey on your lips  
And earthworms rule your brain


I'm changing, arranging  
Things I never thought I'd move before  
I'm changing, arranging  
To your personality I asked for it before  
I need a soul who'll never say what I feel  
Just fearing that I will accept the ideal  
I look up high and I swear all I see  
It's a carbon copy image of me  
I'm dying hard trying  
Baby, baby, for the rest of my life  
I'm trying hard dying  
Maybe, maybe he's trying to be my life  
I've got a never ending battle inside  
Just trying to rectify my personal pride  
I swear I don't know what it's got over me  
But I know it doesn't want to be free


I'm a clone  
I know it and I'm fine  
I'm one and more are on the way  
I'm two, doctor  
Three's on the line  
He'll take incubation another day  
CHORUS: I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroying time  
No more problems on the way  
  
REFRAIN: I'm through doctor  
We don't need your kind  
The other ones  
Ugly ones  
Stupid boys  
Wrong ones  
CHORUS  
Six is having problems  
Adjusting to his clone status  
Have to put him on a shelf  
(Please don't put me on the shelf)  
All day long we hear him crying so loud  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
Be myself  
Be myself  
  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroyed time  
No more problems on the way  
REFRAIN  
CHORUS  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
  
  
  


Your dress is hangin' on a hook on the door  
My jeans are lying in a pile on the floor, yeah  
Flat on my back, tryin' to catch my breath  
When we were rockin' tonight  
I thought that we were gonna rock to death  
  
But what's that in your eyes?  
I'm no longer paralyzed  
Here we go again  
  
Crawlin', you come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
We come crawling  
You come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
  
Your hair is tangled and your lipstick is gone  
You're stretched out, calling my name  
With just your high heels on  
We hunt each other on our hands and our knees  
Well I'm an alley cat  
And you're a hot little Siamese  
  
But what's that in your eyes?  
I'm no longer paralyzed  
Here we go again  
  
Crawlin', you come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
We come crawling  
You come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you


I'm gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
They'd like to take you home  
They'd like to purr and tease you  
But I'm a passionate man  
And I couldn't leave her alone  
  
'Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you won't  
  
Sometimes they look so good  
But don't you let 'em deceive you  
'Cause then you find out that they got  
Some kind of a venomous mind  
  
And the thing that's worse  
Is that it all seems worth it  
I'm still a passionate man  
And she wouldn't leave me alone  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well, now don't ask me, boys  
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow  
  
And you are damned if you do  
And damned if you don't  
You're damned if you will  
And you are damned if you won't  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well, now don't ask me, boys  
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow  
  
Gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
They'd like to take you home  
They'd like to purr and tease you  
And I'm a passionate man  
And I couldn't leave her alone  
  
'Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you won't  
  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
And damned if you won't, ooh  
  
I'll be damned


Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin  
She got them from the shelf up on the wall  
Betty's mommy wasn't there to save her  
She didn't hear her little baby call  
Wah!  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't want you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Daddy is an agrophile in Texas  
Mommy's on the bar most every night  
Little Betty's sleeping in the graveyard  
Living there in burgundy and white  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't love you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Goodbye Little Betty  
Goodbye Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
Betty, so long  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't need you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Goodbye, Little Betty  
  
Order in the court! Order in the court room!  
Order! Order in the court! Order!


We're in trouble all the time  
You read about us all in the papers  
We walk around and bump into walls - a blind delegation  
And we ain't afraid of high power  
We're bullet proof  
And we've never heard of Eisenhower  
Missile power, justice or truth  
  
We're the Department of Youth  
Your new Department of Youth  
We're the Department of Youth  
Just me and youth  
  
We talk about this whole stupid world  
And still come out laughing  
We never make any sense  
But hell that never mattered  
But we'll make it through our blackest hour  
We're living proof  
And we've never heard of Billy Sunday  
Damon Runyon, manners or couth  
We're the Department of Youth  
Your new Department of Youth  
We're the Department of Youth  
Just me and youth  
  
We're the Department of Youth  
The new Department of Youth  
We're the Department of Youth  
We've got the power  
We're the Department of Youth  
And who gave it to you?  
Donny Osmond!  
What?!


I'm a gambler  
And I'm a runner  
But you knew that  
When you lay down  
  
I'm a picture  
Of ugly stories  
I'm a killer  
And I'm a clown  
  
Step into the street by sundown  
Step into your last goodbye  
You're a target just by living  
Twenty dollars will make you die  
  
I wear lace  
And I wear black leather  
My hands are lightning up  
On my gun  
  
My shots are clean  
And my, my shots are final  
My shots are deadly  
And when it's done  
  
You're as stiff as my smoking barrel  
You're as dead as a desert night  
You're a notch  
And I'm a legend  
You're at peace  
And I must hide  
  
Tell where the hell I'm going  
Let my bones fall in the dust  
Can't you hear that ghost that's calling  
As my Colt begins to rust  
In the dust  
  
I'm a killer  
I'm a clown  
I'm a priest  
That's gone to town


Get ready for the lady  
She's gonna be a treat  
Simmer slightly 'til ready  
Make her soft too  
Make her sweet  
  
I kiss the tears off from your chest  
I felt the poison fright that's in your breath  
I knew your precious life and I know your death  
I squeeze the love out of your soul  
All the perfect love that's in your soul  
You're just another spirit on parole  
  
Devil's food  
Devil's food  
Devil's food


Pardon me,  
But you see,  
I've seen that face before  
I know those eyes  
Unearthly wise  
I feel it more and more  
To look at you,  
Deja vu,  
Chills me to the core  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
But that only confused me  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
And that frankly amused me  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Gradually  
I can see  
Things are getting clear  
That ageless face  
Satanic grace  
This sudden rush of fear  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
So I'd better be leavin'  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Here I am  
Door's been slammed  
They're gonna roast my hide  
Make me bleed  
'Til I plead  
For you to let me die  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
God, I wish I'd believed them  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet  
In the night in my sleep?  
Didn't we meet  
In the night in my sleep  
Somewhere?


A hundred numbers on my wall  
Some with names I sometimes call  
I drop a coin and watch it fall  
Tryin' to get connected to you  
  
A thousand hours all alone  
My softest pillow turns hard as stone  
This is the longest night on my own  
Lying here thinking of you  
  
Sometimes I shake my head  
And laugh to myself  
I'd like start again with somebody else  
I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I could have been someone  
I could have been something  
It would have been nothing to die for you  
Baby, you're going to need me  
You'd better believe me  
It would have been easy to die for you  
  
A milloin memories flood my brain  
Drown my sorrow  
Kill my pain  
Wets my thirst for you again  
Just another night to get through  
  
All my neighbors scream for quite at my door  
Shattered glass and torn up photos thrown on the floor  
Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These cuts are deep but you plead innocent  
Are you hell or are you heaven-sent?  
You're much too cold to know how much  
You meant to me, yeah  
  
A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes  
But it's just a joke now  
And I'm laughing at your lies  
You made me hard as rock and now I realize  
  
[Chorus]


It looked so good, your perfect plan  
You had to get greedy to be the man  
Now you're holding the bag, paying the price  
Gonna get burned by the heat of the ice  
  
Dirty diamonds  
  
You rolled the dice, you bet your life  
You put your trust in your trophy wife  
Got stabbed in the back in the blink of an eye  
She's in bed with the boys and the FBI  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
Ah, ah oh yeah  
  
You're tied to a chair witha gun at your head  
Your face is all smeared with the blood that's been shed  
You were gonna be rich  
Now you're gonna be dead  
And all that glitters turns to lead  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
  
Diamonds don't cheat  
Diamonds don't lie  
Diamonds are forever  
Diamonds never die  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die  
You better run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die  
You better run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die  
You better run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die


I want to tell you a story, happened long ago  
About a redneck boy down from Tupelo  
I got the slick black hair, I played a rock guitar  
I liked to shake my hips, man, then i went too far  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
I had a lot of girls, yeah, I had a lot of guns  
When they found me dead, ow, the whole world was stunned  
Went to the pearly gates, said, "I'm the hippest thing"  
And Peter said "Well son, we already got ourselves a king"  
  
He lived on southern deep-fried spam,  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
He finished his short life sweaty and bloated and stoned  
(A-Hey-Hey)  
He ruled his domain and he died on the throne  
No "Yes-Men", no colonel, he went all alone...  
  
(Hey, man, that looks like me down there on the floor)  
  
I heard the devil cry real loud and clear  
"You were the big man, there, hejust a sideman here  
Well, I know your face, and I've heard your name  
Looks like heaven's loss, gonna be my gain"  
(I've got plans for you, man)  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
Well, I woke up, right here in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland, thank you, thank you very much

When my mother died, she laid in bed and cried:  
"I'm going to miss you, my brave little cowboy"  
I saw my father smile (a smile he tried to hide)  
He told me "Son, I've really got you now, boy"  
So come on, little cowboy  
  
Go buck and fuck and make a buck  
Gonna show me how, boy?  
I wish you lots and lots of luck

We blasted Glasgow  
Invaded France  
Assaulted Sweden  
Took down our pants  
And lovely England  
My little kitten  
Deliriously  
Black widow Billy  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain, yeah  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain  
Jumped on the concord  
Ain't much for sittin'  
I told my boys, now  
No public spiting  
No bar room fighting  
No bad head splitting  
Behave yourself 'cause we're, we're back in Britain  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain  
Cost six years of time and space  
It took so long to change his face  
To redesign his streamline face  
Now strong and sleek but still no taste  
Guilty  
I'm guilty  
Won't go to Hungary  
Iran is out  
Welcome to Moscow, huh  
I have my doubts  
Can't get near Libya  
That boy's insane  
Let's head for London  
Where we can scream again  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain, yeah  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain, yeah  
For Britain only  
Only for Britain


A tree has grown on the spot  
Where her body did rest  
Blood seeped in the soil  
From the knife in her chest  
  
The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail  
I wonder how the bugs remember Gail  
  
Oh, what a lovely young girl  
Everybody would say  
You can still hear her laugh  
In the shadows on a cold winter day  
  
A dog dug up a bone and wagged his tail  
I wonder how the dog.. remembers Gail  
  
The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail  
I wonder how that I'll remember Gail


You got your sugar  
You got your spice  
You got a kitten  
Now isn't that nice  
You just can't wait for a picnic in Spring

You make some babies with your warm little spouse  
Ah, how nice

For a little piece of cake in the night time yeah  
You wait and wait you can't wait any longer  
You wait and wait, couldn't be any wronger no

Yes, I'm goin' to the river, gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Because the gal I love, she's gone and left this town  
Well when she left me, I bowed my head and cried

Do a show  
Save a child  
Raise a million bucks  
That'll last a while  
Fight at parties  
Buy a horse  
Lose a couple  
Win that big divorce  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
  
Saw my chance  
Made my break  
Took the biggest float  
In the Rose parade  
Got jailed  
No disgrace  
A hundred million people  
Saw my face  
  
Called a conference  
With the press  
Announced my marriage plans  
In a wedding dress  
Climb a building  
At six-below  
On New Year's Eve  
Without a stitch of clothes  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
As long as they spell my name right  
I hope that they catch my best side  
  
Popped out  
From a cake  
At the President's ball  
What a big mistake  
Fifty guns  
Aimed at me  
I was nearly killed  
But what publicity  
Nominated  
Something big  
Stole the hottest scene  
Says the Globe And Trib  
Porno movie  
Comes to light  
But I was starving then  
So that's alright  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
  
As long as the spell my name right  
Hope that they catch my best side  
Keep my sidewalk status star bright  
Feel free to walk on me tonight  
Just don't spit on me  
  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines


You're with your baby  
And you're parked alone  
On a summer night  
You're deep in love  
But you're deeper in the woods  
You think you're doin' alright  
  
You heard a voice  
Did you see that face  
Or was it just a dream  
It can't be real  
That only happens, babe  
On the movie screen  
  
If you see him comin'  
Get away if you can  
He's a dangerous man  
Throws a dangerous party man  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's going out tonight  
Going to make his rounds to get his fill  
Standing staight and tall  
He's a ton of fun  
And he's dressed to kill  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But he's back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
Don't you know  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But he's back on the prowl  
Again and again and again

And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll

The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll

Until he sees me dance

I'm in control, I got a bulletproof soul  
And I'm full of self-esteem  
I invented myself with no one's help  
I'm a prototype supreme  
I sit on my private throne  
And run my lifestyle all alone  
Me, myself and I agree  
We don't need nobobdy else  
  
I never learned to bow, bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
That's all  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
  
I got no time to take advice  
I want to gamble with my eternity with loaded dice  
I don't need a preacher in my face  
When I'm the omnipresent ruler of the human race  
Ain't gonna spend my life being no one's fool  
I was born to rock and I was born to rule  
But if I'm wrong on judgement day  
I'm royally screwed with hell to pay  
  
I never learned to bow, bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
That's all  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God


I bought a Porsche  
And I'm leavin Grand Rapids  
Quit my job, quit my school  
Quit this place  
My mother cried  
My father was fried  
Hey, I've got no time, man  
I want to say goodbye to my babes  
I like girls  
  
I dumped on Sheila on Thursday  
I'll drop Melissa today  
I'll kiss some tears off of Donna  
Ask if she'll call on Shauna  
Amanda, and Sandra and Kay  
I like girls, I love 'em to death  
  
Hey Valentino! You going somewhere?  
You wouldn't sneak out on me, would you?  
What's that a blond hair?  
He must visualize himself an Errol Flynn  
  
I see myself a suave sophisticated lover  
I'll meet a rich hot old Hollywood dame  
You see, my ultimate goal  
Will be my life bein' told  
In a penthouse letter that I can frame  
And keep it all my life  
Girls, I love 'em, oh yeah  
  
New luggage? Did you say you were going  
Somewhere? Oh, just out for some fresh air  
Does she have a nice pair?  
  
He was swallowed alive by the freeway  
Turned into an ant on parade  
He bravely drove off that beast  
Aimed his car back to the east  
Why be a snack at home?  
I'm a feast, for the girls  
I like girls, I really like 'em  
  
Well,well,well.Look who's back. Run out of gas?  
Patty, I was just gonna call you. Look...  
I left Donna and Shauna  
And Katy and Carrie  
Melissa and Dena  
I just didn't have any use for 'em  
I just want you  
Really, no really, honest!


I love that mountain with those four big heads  
I love Velveeta slapped on Wonder bread  
I love a commie if he's good and dead, yup  
I love America  
  
I love Old Glory and homemade pie  
I think them Ruskies should be sterilized  
I love my chicken Kentucky Fried  
Finger lickin' good!

And bring the kids to meet my snake  
I say, "Bye."  
Granny says, "Bye."  
And the snake says, "Sssssssssss"  
  
I love General Patton in World War Two  
My Pocket Fisherman and my Crazy Glue  
I love the Beav and Wally too, yeah  
I love America  
  
I love the bomb, hot dogs and mustard  
I love my girl, but I sure don't trust her  
I love what the Indians did to Custer  
I love America  
  
Here they come!  
There they go!  
  
I love my jeans, and I love my hair  
I love a real tight skirt and a real nice pair  
And on the fourth of July, I love the rockets' red glare  
I love America  
  
I watch the A-Team every Tuesday night  
I graduated, but I ain't too bright  
I love Detroit 'cause I was born to fight  
I love America  
  
I love the Tigers, but I hate the Mets  
I ride my hog, but I race my Vette  
I gotta job, but, hell, I'm still in debt  
I love America  
  
I love my bar, and I love my truck  
I'd do most anything to make a buck  
I love a waitress who loves to... flirt!  
They're the best kind  
I love America  
Turn me on  
Well, I gotta go now  
I love America  
Bye bye, I tell you what though, I really do love it  
You ain't going to catch me at no may-day rally


Touched by thoughts  
As cold as ice  
Like some bathroom floor  
No love can be worth this price  
Still I ask for more  
  
Endless days and restless nights  
And forgotten scenes  
Hopelessly I tried to find  
Escape from this deam  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Love is sweet  
And bitter too  
The taste can leave cold  
You know I hate it  
But I cannot refuse to capture control  
  
How it seems  
There's no way out  
I guess I never knew  
Emptiness has left no doubt  
Now I want you  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
You've been gone for so long  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
Tell me you're coming back


My tape recorder,  
It must be lyin'  
'Cause this I just can't believe.  
I hear a voice that's cryin',  
That's not me.  
  
The wheel goes round.  
I hear a sound.  
It's comin' out all wrong.  
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.  
  
I been livin' in my own shell so long:  
The only place I ever feel at home.  
  
And oh, that music,  
I hate those lyrics.  
It stayed inside me so long.  
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.  
  
But pardon me,  
I'm not lookin' for sympathy,  
Not sympathy.  
I'm just thinking out loud.  
The melody,  
It goes nowhere pointlessly.  
Silence please.  
  
I been livin' in my own shell so long:  
The only place I ever feel at home.  
  
And oh, that music,  
I hate those lyrics.  
It stayed inside me so long.  
And I swear to you I never.


I was just kicking down the street  
And the sun was in my eyes  
So I couldn't see the truck  
That was sixty times my size  
And just seconds off from splattering me  
Let me tell you  
I was so scared I couldn't move  
Like my boots were full of glue  
Then I felt a little tug  
And I thought of good Old Blue  
And he pulled me from that catastrophe  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
I'm alive  
  
I was spitting in the canyon  
Near the cliff up on the mountain  
When an unexpected sneeze  
Hung me in the breeze  
At forty five degrees in the sky  
Suddenly I felt something  
Had me by the belt  
And in between my praying  
Swore I heard a stallion neighing  
Was the ghost of my horse  
And I cried, yes I cried  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
Hey, I'm alive  
  
Things were getting gory  
Got caught on territory  
Belonging to the Crutches  
In an alley in their clutches  
Looking kind of dismal that night  
Well the leader's name was Fats  
Swinging broken baseball bats  
Things got really frantic  
Starting jumping in their panic  
Hallucinating billions of rats  
Lots of rats  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive, I'm alive, real alive  
  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
To save my life  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive  
He's alive, he's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, yeah  
He's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, real alive  
Alive, alive, alive  
Alive, alive, alive, alive  
Alive, alive, alive, alive  
I'm alive


I never kicked a dog, a child or my wife  
I never looked at pornography  
I swear it on my holy saint mother's life  
But somehow she's down here with me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once you're there, you're there, it's much too late  
I can cry and scream it's just not fair  
To leave me here like you don't care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
  
I never stole a thing, a toy or a kiss  
My conscience is a clear as can be  
And when I was a teen, all the sex that I missed  
Was an abstinence blessing to me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once you're there, you're there, it's much too late  
I can cry and scream it's just not fair  
To leave me here like you don't care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
It's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
It's much to late


What did I do to deserve such a fate  
I didn't really want to get  
Involved in this thing  
Someone handed me this gun and I  
I gave it everything  
Yeah, I gave it everything  
  
I came into this life  
Looked all around  
I saw just what I liked  
And took what I found  
Nothing came easy  
Nothing came free  
Nothing came all until they  
Came after me  
  
Yeah-hey, yeah  
  
I didn't really want to get  
Involved in this thing  
Someone handed me this gun and I  
I gave it everything  
Yeah, I gave it everything


I find myself running in circles  
Lost and half insane  
And I need a cure sometimes  
To knock out the pain  
  
So I yell out for some kind of angel  
To come down and rescue me  
Be as soft as you can  
Put a drink in my hand  
I'm as scared as I ever could be  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-aace and whiskey  
  
Lots of things I really want here  
Lots of things I really need  
There's an animal soul inside  
That I've gotta feed  
My hot mamas feminine body (?)  
Always gets a rise from me  
She's so soft in my hands  
I give her all she can stand  
Make a full fledged man outta me  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey

To go and show you things  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
  
I'll end up a broken old hobo  
With red and yellow eyes  
Swear' and drunk and dyin'  
But no ones surprised  
That's a long long way from today babe  
As far as I can see  
So shake off your shoes  
Go and get me my booze  
Lay your love and your laces on me  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey


Somebody saw you at the station  
You had your suitcase in your hand  
You didn't give no information  
You walked off with another man  
I'm always standing in the shadows, baby  
I watched you give yourself away  
You take them home into your bedroom  
You had another busy day  
  
I tried to look the other way and fake it  
You push me to the limits  
I can't take it  
  
CHORUS  
One down, one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
Red lights, stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
  
Someday they'll put me in a squad car  
Someday they'll throw away the key  
But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog  
Cause that's what you taught me to be  
  
You looked into the eyes of men above you  
I was the one who really tried to love you  
  
One down, one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
Red lights, stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
Pull the trigger  
  
I tried to look the other way and fake it  
You know, you push me right to the limit  
I can't take it  
  
One down, one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
Red lights, stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
  
Somebody saw you at the station  
  
"In by Metallizepp"


I was the boy who said all of my prayers  
Laid my clean face on the pillow  
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure  
Through the night  
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing  
It pulled me right out of a dream  
If I knew it was you  
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed  
  
[Chorus]  
Get down, back where you started  
Get down, back into hell  
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted  
I smell your sulfurous smell  
  
All of my things that I play with in daylight  
You turn into monsters at night  
My toys were my friends  
Until you taught them all how to bite  
  
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see  
You scared me with visions of fire  
You danced on my bed  
With the flames on your head dancing higher  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tell you right now  
I don't want your reptile embrace  
I don't want to follow you down to your place  
I don't want to be a child of disgrace  
You can take your whiskey soaked, foaming  
at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup  
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was the boy who said all of my prayers  
Laid my clean face on the pillow  
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure  
Through the night


Billie I wonder why are we insane  
Will we ever get better  
Will we stay the same  
Billie I'm worried  
  
Millie don't worry  
No one knows our pain  
Being in love is crazy not alone that way  
I know you're worried today  
  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone  
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone  
  
Billie my mind seems to wander  
To events of a night long ago  
Driving alone with our guilt well concealed  
In the trunk of your '68 Olds  
  
Millie our world's an asylum  
And our minds like you say ain't that straight  
But you know and I know our passion's  
Not deformed it's true to say  
We'll love our lifetime  
  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone  
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone  
  
Billie I dream of our children  
They're frightening and gruesome and sad  
And I don't want them growing inside me  
They're no price for the love that we have  
  
Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane  
Oh Millie oh Billie  
  
Oh Billie it's fresh in my memory  
The night that it had to be done  
You with your pick axe and scissors  
And you with your shovel and gun  
  
And I liked your late husband Donald  
But such torture his memory brings  
All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies  
Guess love makes you do funny things  
  
Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane  
Oh Millie oh Billie


I'm nuclear infected  
I really don't mind  
I just go out when the sun goes down  
And have a real good time  
  
I can clear out any ballgame  
In a minute and a half  
Just show up - glow up  
And have a real good laugh  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you  
  
I'm nuclear infected  
Really ain't that bad  
In fact it's about the best time  
I guess I ever had  
  
I'm nuclear infected  
Looking for a mate  
So slip on something lead, babe  
And go out on a date  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue, yeah  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you  
  
Nuclear infected --- don't make me angry  
Nuclear infected --- don't make shake  
Nuclear infected --- don't get me to sneeze  
Nuclear infected --- that's a big mistake  
  
I want to live on Three Mile Island  
Where things are clean and neat  
'ause we don't have no health freaks  
Clutterin up our streets  
I'm nuclear infected, I need something to eat  
A China Syndrome Salad with plutonium and cheese  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you


Your cruel device  
Your blood, like ice  
One look, could kill  
My pain, your thrill  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
  
Your mouth, so hot  
Your web, I'm caught  
Your skin, so wet  
Black lace, on sweat  
  
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)  
I want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name  
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)  
I want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
Poison...  
  
(Guitar solo)  
  
One look, could kill  
My pain, your thrill  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
Poison (Poi-son)  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
Yeah  
Well I don't want to break these chains  
Poison (Poi-son)  
Runnin' deep inside my veins  
Burnin' deep inside my brain  
Poison (Poi-son)  
And I don't want to break these chains  
Poison


I'm freezing, I'm frozen, I'm icicle blue  
(So low, low cool)  
Cyber, neurotic, technicians imbue  
(So low, low cool)  
I've been admitted to Refrigerator Heaven  
Until they discover the cure for cancer, I'm low  
Refrigerator Heaven  
So low, Refrigerator Heaven  
  
I'm ice packed, I'm hand-stashed, I'm waiting for you  
I'm older and younger, preserved in a tomb  
I've been admitted to Refrigerator Heaven  
I feel like I (told you a heart)  
I won't get back 'till the sun sets down on the moon  
Won't get back 'till m' sun sets down on the moon


Yeah, I'm such a liar  
One time I told you  
You were the highlight  
Of all of my sexual life  
  
While I'm confessing  
When you're undressing  
I was picking the lock  
On your safe with my knife  
Einstein  
  
If you're so naive  
That you believe  
Everything I said to you  
Well, I got your sex  
And wrote you rubber checks  
Well, what did you think  
I was gonna do  
  
My reputation for exaggeration  
It never got to you  
That's why I left Duluth  
Sometimes I stretch the truth  
  
My dearest darling  
You know that luggage  
It belonged to the blond  
With the really nice pair  
And incidentally  
I sorely missed you  
The pain was so hard to bear  
  
If I would rate you  
Not that I hate you  
But you would end up  
Eighth, maybe ninth in your class  
  
Your build is hot now  
If you could use your  
Brain like you use your ass  
  
Oh, you're so naive  
How could you believe  
Everything I said to you  
  
My reputation for exaggeration  
It never got to you  
Sometimes I'm so uncouth  
Sometimes I stretch the truth  
  
Hey, I'm such a liar  
One time I told you  
You were the highlight  
Of all of my sexual life  
  
I'm remarkably insincere  
Incredibly insincere  
Totally insincere  
Oh don't take it so hard, my dear  
I'm consistently insincere


Sitting on an angry chair  
Angry walls that steal the air  
Stomach hurts and I don't care  
  
What do I see across the way, hey  
See myself molded in clay, oh  
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid heeey  
Changing the shape of his face, ooh... yeah  
  
Candles red I have a pair  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Burning on the angry chair  
  
Little boy made a mistake, hey  
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh  
All that I want is to play, hey  
Get on your knees, time to pray, oh  
  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
Lost my mind, yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
Can't find it anywhere  
I Don't mind, aaah  
  
Corporate prison, we stay hey  
I'm a dull boy, work all day ooh  
So I'm strung out anyway heey  
  
[GUITAR SOLO]  
  
Loneliness is not a phase  
Field of pain is where I graze  
Serenity is far away  
  
Saw my reflection and cried heey  
So little hope that I died, oh  
Feed me your lies, open wide heey  
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh  
  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
Lost my mind, yeah  
I don't mind  
Can't find it anywhere  
I Don't mind aaah  
  
Pink cloud has now turned to gray  
All that I want is to play  
Get on your knees time to pray, boy


I broke you in the canyon  
I drowned you in the lake  
You a snake that I would trample  
Only thing I'd not embrace  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away  
I pushed and then you stumbled  
I kicked you in the face  
You stare at me so hollow  
Got to keep that killin' pace  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away  
I burned the place around you  
I hit you with a rake  
You piss upon my candle  
So proving you're a fake  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away


"Harry! Take the garbage out!"  
"Yes, poopsie."  
  
(Fat girls)  
Ooo, can be so much fun  
Their mouths are motors  
(What a girl)  
So let their motors run!  
  
After they have eaten you  
Out of house and home  
Strip down to your birthday suit  
And let them (halves?) explode!

Fat girls can be so much fun!  
  
When you're done and satisfied  
You must throw them out  
Never have to say, for sure  
(Gross?) them out  
  
Feeding my special ladies  
Have but one thing to gain  
They want to have your babies  
They want you ball and chain  
  
They clean to back and they clean too much  
With only goes out for an occasional where to put! (?)  
They clean to back and they clean too much

Care not for the men who wonder  
Straw that broke your back, you're under  
Cast all them aside who care  
Empty eyes and dead end stare  
  
Pre-chorus:  
Don't you know that none are blind  
To the lie, and you think I don't find..  
what you hide?  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
  
For the horse you've grown much fonder  
Than for me, that I don't ponder  
As the hair of one who bit you  
Smiling bite your own self, too  
  
Pre-chorus:  
And I think that you're not blind  
To the ones you left behind..  
I'll be here  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun.. AAH!!  
  
So be yearning all your life  
Twisting, turning like a knife  
  
Pre-chorus:  
Now you know the reasons why  
Can't get high, or you will die..  
Or you'll die  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
So your sickness weighs a ton  
And God's name is smack for some


In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah  
Come the morning light, it's a see through show  
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Sure to play a part, so you love the game  
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah  
I could set you free, rather hear the sound  
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside


I want to make myself complete  
I want to hold it in my arms  
I want this blow to scar your eyes  
I want this pain to go away  
I want to shake this thinking here  
I wish there was a heaven  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell  
  
You want to write my name in blood  
You want to carve it in my arm  
You want to make yourself a dream  
You want this world under your thumb  
You want to make me shout and scream  
We know there ain't no heaven  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell  
  
And we all know it well...  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell


Love song, take one  
  
I love you and I'm coming back bitch  
I think I should say something  
I can't see you, I can't feel you, I can't, I can't  
  
Wash my face, cut out my teeth and tell me to grin  
My gums are bleeding  
My gums are bleeding  
  
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you  
Calling  
Don't forget your sheep  
First go up for air  
Get a fucking haircut  
Bring up the fleet  
Go fuck yourself  
What about  
Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung  
  
Get something, get, get them, get them  
Get the fuckin' midget  
Get the midget, get the midget  
Get the fuckin midget  
Kiss the fuckin' midget  
  
"Where the deer and antelope play"  
  
Kiss the midget, kiss the midget, kiss the midget, kiss the midget  
  
"That was perfect you guys, that was great!"


It's alright  
There comes a time  
Got no patience to search  
For peace of mind  
Layin' low  
Want to take it slow  
No more hiding or  
Disguising truths I've sold  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know  
  
It's okay  
Had a bad day  
Hands are bruised from  
Breaking rocks all day  
Drained and blue  
I bleed for you  
You think it's funny, well  
You're drowning in it too  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know  
  
Yeah, it's fine  
We'll walk down the line  
Leave our rain, a cold  
Trade for warm sunshine  
You my friend  
I will defend  
And if we change, well I  
Love you anyway  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know


OoooOh!  
  
I've had my share of one-night-stands  
And I've seen it all  
But you've got a hold on me  
Right against the wall  
  
Over the edge  
You've got me  
Over the edge  
Head over heels  
  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
  
I never thought I'd see the day  
When I would want you there  
But nobody ever made me feel  
The way when you call  
  
Over the edge  
You've got me  
Over the edge  
Head over heels  
  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
  
Over the edge  
You've got me  
Over the edge  
Head over heels  
  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
  
I'm over the edge  
I'm over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Now I'm over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
I'm over the edge  
Over the edge


Give away a love  
And then remove another too  
Painted words adorn the walls  
Echoing untrue  
(I feel cold)  
  
Promises abound  
You rarely find it to begin  
Maybe I'm afraid  
To let you all the way in  
(I guess so)  
  
I excuse myself  
I'm used to my little cell  
I amuse myself  
In my very own private hell  
  
Lately I'm beside myself  
Pretending, unconcerned  
Standing on a corner  
Where I threw you on a turn  
(I'll move on)  
  
Flowers on a cross remain  
Mark an ending scene  
Damn it all if blood you spill  
Turn the grass more green  
(Life is short)  
  
I excuse myself  
I'm used to my little cell  
I amuse myself  
In my very own private hell

And you must change patterns all we trained  
Or n'er regain peace you seek  
Now you hear me, for the things I see  
Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah  
Throw out, blow up, hold in  
Show fine, no signs, grow blind


What the hell am I?  
Thousand eyes, a fly  
Lucky then I'd be  
In one day deceased  
  
Sickman, sickman, sickman  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
  
In this sick world of mine  
What the hell am I?  
Leper from inside  
Inside wall of peace  
  
Dirty and diseased  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
I can see the end is getting near  
I won't rest until my head is clear  
  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
Can you see the end?  
Choke on me my friend  
  
Must to drown these thoughts  
Purity over rot  
"Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair  
With head high and eyes alert  
  
I tread on a plane of many  
We who are of good nature and intention,  
But cannot touch on the dark  
Recesses of memory  
  
And pain learned, so come walk  
With me, feel the pain,  
And release it..."  
What the hell am I?  
  
Worn eroded pride  
Saddened 10 miles wide  
I'm gonna let it slide  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
  
Ahh, etc., etc.


Yeah, I want to travel south this year

Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
Yeah, hey Yeah, tears that soak  
A callous heart  
  
Why you act frightened

Your weakness builds me  
So someday you'll see  
  
I stay away  
  
Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
I stay away (4x)


One, a-one time, yeah  
  
Am I too contagious  
Full of sick desire  
Am I that I promise  
Burning corpsed pyre  
  
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother  
Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more  
Suck your woman down  
  
Am I your reflection  
Melting mirror smile  
Am I worth the value  
Do my love defile  
  
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother  
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more  
Ain't no day the sun don't crack  
  
Then to brand some name across my back so you care?  
Find someone to tell you

Don't mind...I don't care no more  
  
Memory, set me free, yeah

Then I heard a voice  
  
Said son you have a choice  
I then slapped my face  
Let me be, I'm okay

It's too bright over there  
I can shift, cannot steer  
  
So I drive them away  
For a while, then I stay  
Little skinny, okay

Now I have to go home  
Do as, when in Rome  
  
Let me be, I'm alright  
Can't you see I'm just fine  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm asleep anyway  
Let me be, I'm okay

To you screaming out his name in love  
Oh no no  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey yeah they say you love the girl  
While I'm wasted as you taste it  
Wicked pleasures, sins of flesh and blood  
Woke up drunk in the morning  
Sipping on my cup all day  
Stone cold bitch you're ballin'  
And I bet that you want to stay  
Well you go down to the city  
And you get yourself in line  
Cause if I don't need you baby

Get This!  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?

When The Morning Sun Streaks Across My Room  
And I'm Waken Up From Another Dream Of You  
When I'm On The Road, Once Again It Seems  
All that's Left Behind, Is A Chain Of Broken Dreams  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh.... I Love You....  
How I Wish That Love, was all We Need To Live  
What A Life We'd Have, Cause I've Got So Much To Give  
But It Seems So Wrong, Deep Inside My Heart  
That The Dollar Sign Should Be Keeping Us Apart  
But You Know I Love  
Yes I Love You.....Ohhh I Love You  
And If Only I Could Find My Way Back To The Time  
When The Problems Of This Life it Did not Cross your Minds  
And All The Answers could be Found In Children's Nursery Rhymes  
And I'd Come Running Back To You, I'd Come Running Back To You  
But You Know We Can't Live On Dreams Alone  
And To Pay The Rent, I Must Leave You All Alone  
And Though I Made My Choice Many Years Ago  
And now This Traveling Life Is The Only One I Know  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You...  


This old house is falling down around my ears  
I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone you hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my better side  
  
What days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me  
I'm living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day


I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore  
I hope that I've learned this time  
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for  
The way that it is in my mind  
  
Someday I'll get over you  
I'll live to see it all through  
But I'll always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you  
  
I won't let it change me  
Not if I can  
I'd rather believe in love  
And give it away  
As much as I can  
To those that I'm fondest of  
  
Someday I'll get over you  
I'll live to see it all through  
But I'll always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you  
  
Someday I'll get over you  
I'll live to see it all through  
But I'll always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you


When years seem like days to me  
No time on my hands  
I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land  
  
When home seems so far from me  
Heaven's lights look dim  
It's just as far as my deepest heart  
Where my heart's Father lives  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in my face  
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place  
  
When life seems so hard to bear  
When shadows look real  
The circumstance is your Father's care  
Go by faith not what you feel  
  
If you have been running too  
Stop now in your tracks  
Turn again to the one in you  
Put your burden on His back  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in your face  
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place  
  
When years seem like days to me  
No time on my hands  
I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land  


I think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door.  
There'll be a better world waitin' if I do.  
'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before,  
The only time I let my heart turn to you.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice,  
And askin' me to walk the extra mile.  
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price.  
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight  
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze.  
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride.  
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face.  
  
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door


Went to the fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didn't what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
Said she'd take a look at my palm  
Said "Son do you feel kind of warm?"  
And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said "You're in love."  
  
Said it could not be so,  
Not with all the girls I know.  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes.  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Much to my big surprise  
The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didn't see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me  
  
At last something shook me  
As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love


I've lived a life full of sorrow  
With no where to run or to hide  
Happiness you'll see is borrowed  
All I want is you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
Gentle river take me away  
to the time of happier days  
All I need is love and company  
Gentle river bring him back to me  
  
You can spend all your time a'cryin'  
Listen here I don't need your sympathy  
Cause I've made my life to live it  
All I need is you here with me...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gentle river bring em' back to me


I left home when I was seventeen  
I just grew tired of falling down  
And I'm sure I was told  
The allure of the road  
Would be all I found  
  
And all the answers that I started with  
Turned out questions in the end  
So years roll on by  
And just like the sky  
The road never ends  
  
And the people who love me still ask me  
When are you coming back to town  
And I answer quite frankly  
When they stop building roads  
And all God needs is gravity to hold me down


I can hear those lonesome midnight sighs in your sleep  
I can hear the freight train's whistle cry, it's tellin' me  
It's telling me, oh darlin' can't you see  
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye  
Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
Better take some time to talk it over again with me  
Better get all your things together now if you leave  
It's killin' me, oh darlin' can't you see  
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye  
Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
I can hear your footsteps movin' slowly across my floor  
I can see your shadow look back at me outside my door  
What'cha waitin' for? Oh darlin' I know for sure  
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye  
Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
  


It was so right  
It was so wrong  
Almost at the same time  
The pain and ache  
A heart can take  
No one really knows  
But when the memories cling and take you there  
Till you no longer care  
You can let go now  
It's not right for me  
To cling to you  
Somehow I just needed time  
From what was to be  
It's not like me  
To hold somebody down  
But I was tossed high by love  
Almost never came down  
Only to land  
Where no love is found  
And I'm no longer bound  
I can let go now  
  


If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side?  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a restless bird in flight?  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel  
Will you still be there for me  
Or will I awake to a faded love searching for freedoms gain  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side?  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a bird who yearns to fly?


If I could have the world and all it owns  
A thousand kingdoms, a thousand thrones  
If all the earth were mine to hold  
With wealth my only goal  
  
I'd spend my gold on selfish things  
Without the love that Your life brings  
Just a little bit more is all I'd need  
Till life was torn from me  
  
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand  
Though rich or poor I may be  
Faith can see right through the circumstance  
Sees the forest in spite of the trees  
Your grace provides for me  
  
If I should walk the streets, no place to sleep  
No faith in promises You keep  
I'd have no way to buy my bread  
With a bottle for my bed  
  
But if I trust the one who died for me  
Who shed His blood to set me free  
If I live my life to trust in You  
Your grace will see me through  
  
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand  
Though rich or poor I may be  
Faith can see right through the circumstance  
Sees the forest in spite of the trees  
  
If I could have the world...  
If I could have the world and all it owns


It doesn't matter what I want  
It doesn't matter what I need  
It doesn't matter if I cry  
Don't matter if I bleed  
You've been on a road  
Don't know where it goes or where it leads  
  
It doesn't matter what I want  
It doesn't matter what I need  
If you've made up your mind to go  
I won't beg you to stay  
You've been in a cage  
Throw you to the wind you fly away  
  
It doesn't matter what I want  
It doesn't matter what I need  
It doesn't matter if I cry  
Doesn't matter if I bleed  
Feel the sting of tears  
Falling on this face you've loved for years


The nights are so lonely and the days pass me by  
True love has faded, left me behind  
So we'll just move along and stop wasting time  
It's over all over now  
  
It's over, end of the line  
It's over and your doin' fine  
It's over and over and over, I'm asking why  
You're leaving it's over now  
  
Gone are the love songs that only we knew  
Robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through  
Gone is the sweet love, tried but untrue  
It's over all over now  
  
It's over, end of the line  
It's over and my desperate heart is still trying to find some way,  
Hoping you'll stay  
Cause it's over, all over now  
It's over, all over now


Through trials, troubles and care  
I know Jesus my savior is there  
Giving me faith through darkest days  
Keeping me on the narrow way  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  
Jesus lived through darkest pain  
Rejected by men, despising the shame  
Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief  
He gave His life so we may be free  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  
I know that Jesus died for me  
Canceled my debt at Calvary  
Rose from the dead, unlocked Heaven's door  
Trust in His love and live evermore  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  


The sun came up on Monday morn,  
The world was all in flame.  
It's all a mortal man can do,  
To make it right again.  
  
Swing and turn Jubilee  
Live and learn Jubilee  
  
The moon came up I stood my ground,  
And swore to not give in.  
To never rest and do my best,  
To rid this world of sin.  
  
Swing and turn jubilee  
Live and learn jubilee  
  
The one who spoke cried tears of hope,  
That we might change in time.  
And when I looked into her eyes,  
The fear I saw was mine.  
  
Swing and turn jubilee  
Live and learn jubilee  
  
The time had come to travel on,  
I made my way alone.  
My soul will mend at journey's end,  
This road will take me home.  
  
Swing and turn jubilee  
Live and learn jubilee


Leaves were falling, just like embers,  
In colors red and gold, they set us on fire  
Burning just like moonbeams in our eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody said they saw me, swinging the world by the tail  
Bouncing over a white cloud, killing the blues.  
  
Now I'm guilty of something  
I hope you never do  
Because there is nothing  
Any sadder than losing yourself in love.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And then you've ask me, just to leave you  
To set out on my own  
And get what I needed.  
You want me to find what I've already had.  
  
[Chorus x2]


I've spent my life  
Lookin' for you  
Findin' my way  
Wasn't easy to do  
But I knew there was you  
All the while  
And it's been worth  
Every mile  
  
[Chorus]  
So, lay down beside me  
Love me and hide me  
And kiss all the hurtin'  
Of this world away  
Hold me so close  
That I feel your heart beat  
And don't ever wander away  
  
Mornings and evenings  
All were the same  
There was no music  
Till I heard your name  
I knew when I saw you smile  
And now I can rest for a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And hold me so close  
That I feel your heart beat  
And don't ever wander away  
  
Love me and hide me  
  
Till I feel your heart beat


Gonna lay my burden down  
Lay my body in the ground  
Cold clay against my skin  
But I don't care at all  
  
Can't seem to find my piece of mind  
So with the earth I'll lay entwined  
Six feet underground  
My feet are warm and dry  
  
When I get to the other side  
I'll put your picture way up high  
But I'm not coming back to you  
It's just too far  
  
If I was cast off on the sea  
Would you come and look for me  
Or would you just let me sink  
Beneath the waves so blue  
  
What if I had learned to fly  
Fly all night till day drew nigh  
Touch down upon a branch and  
Scan the crowd for you  
  
When I touch my feet on the land  
I'll kiss your lips and take you in  
But you know I'm not here to stay  
It's just too far  
  
Darling can't you hear me cry  
My bones are broke  
My tongue is tied  
The moon is swaying back and forth  
Against the navy sky  
Is all I can see  
My body is trembling on my knees  
Just have a little mercy on me  
Run away and hide  
  
When I sleep the angels sing  
But I cannot hear a thing  
Eyes close  
Dreaming of the better days gone by  
  
When I wake the trumpets play  
And I'm standing at the gates  
Fall down and joy  
I know my race has just been won  
  
When I was young my momma would say  
Well life is hard, but that's O.K.  
If you can make it through the day  
It's not that far  
No, it's not that far


I wanna run away  
Don't come out looking 'round  
Too busy dealing with it on my own  
He's right behind me  
Please God I can't be found  
Don't cast another stone  
Feel out the night, until the sunrise  
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn  
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks  
And I'm as good as gone  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
  
And in the end  
Will we make our amends  
Just like we're face to face another dawn  
And in the light, or when the moon shines  
Will you take me on home?  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong


Oh my Lord, Please don't forsake me  
This is your child, I'm tired and sore  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need your love, my soul is poor  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord, I can't remember  
When I first said, "Come in my life,"  
For I have lived my life in darkness,  
My whole world is filled with strife  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest.


You're the lucky one so I've been told  
As free as the wind blowing down the road  
Loved by many, hated by none  
I'd say you were lucky 'cause  
You know what you've done  
Not a care in the world, not a worry in sight  
Everything is gonna be alright 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
You're the lucky one always having fun  
A jack of all trades, a master of none  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why, when, where or how  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why when where or how  
No matter where you're at it's where you'll be  
You can bet you're luck won't follow me  
Just give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one


Yesterday the odds were stacked  
In favor of my expectations  
Flyin' above the rest,  
Never fallin' from the nest  
Tuesday came and went  
And now I'm in a little situation  
Maybe it's for the best  
I can live alone, I guess  
  
[Chorus]  
Maybe I can stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe he'll fly on home  
  
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart  
From better conversation  
I'm hung up on all my doubt  
Trying to sort the whole thing out  
Tell me that I'm smart enough  
To deal with all the information  
Spinning inside my head  
Every word he ever said  
  
[Chorus: x2]


There's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,  
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone  
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights  
They remind him, of nights long ago,  
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley
marred,  
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees,  
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold  
[Chorus:]  
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay  
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away  
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,  
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love  
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear  
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves  
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride  
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
  


I've put it all behind me  
Nothin' left to do or doubt  
Some may say  
  
But every silver linin'  
Always seems to have a cloud  
That comes my way  
  
Anticipated pleasure  
Or unexpected pain  
No choice I feel  
  
Love is hard to measure  
Hidden in the rain  
That's why you'll find me  
  
Here all alone and still wonderin' why  
Waitin' inside for the cold to get colder  
And here where it's clear that I've wasted my time  
Hopin' to fly 'cause it's almost over now  
  
People come together  
People go their own way  
Love conquers few  
  
And I'll do whatever  
I'll say what I need to say  
Just not for you  
  
How many days should I smile with a frown  
'Cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders?  
And how many nights must I wake up alone  
And know in my soul that it's almost over now?  
  
Love is like a paper airplane  
Flyin' in the folded dent  
Ridin' high, dippin' low  
But innocence is fair game  
I'm hopin' I can hold it in  
Our love will die, I know


Well, it's always we ramble, this river and I  
All along your green valleys, I work till I die  
My land I'll defend with my life need it be  
'Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free  
  
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground  
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down  
Every state in this union us migrants have been  
Lord, we come with the dust and we go with the wind  
  
California, Arizona, I harvest your crops  
Then it's on up North to Oregon to gather your hogs  
Take the beet from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine  
Just to place on your table your that light, sparkling wine


Sometimes I'm battle weary  
I forget to use my shield  
The arrows pierce my armor  
And I stumble in the filed  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
I'll think my life is over  
But the Lord he comes to me  
He heals my wounded spirit  
And he sets me on my feet  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Sometimes your battle weary  
But the war's already won  
Keep your head and hold your shield high  
'Til your days of life are done  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  


Tonight, I waited but my heart is so cold  
'Cause you never stay more than a minute, so I'm told  
I know you're just doing your job  
But what am I supposed to do?  
When all I want for Christmas, darling, is to be with you  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking, yeah  
I'm not asking for a miracle, just a night  
And if you just look in my eyes, you just might  
There'll be no other woman who'll treat you like I can  
(Come on over here)  
I'll be your loving, darling, you'll be my loving man  
Oh, I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
(Keep on walking)  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  


Who would sell their soul for love  
Or waste one tear on compromise?  
Should be easy enough  
To know a heartache in disguise  
But the heart rules the mind  
And the going gets rough  
Pride takes the fall  
When you find that kind of love  
  
I can't help feeling like a fool  
Since I lost that place inside  
Where my heart knew its way  
And my soul was ever wise  
Once innocence was lost  
There was not faith enough  
Still my heart held on  
When it found that kind of love  
  
Though beauty is rare enough  
Still we trust  
Somehow we'll find it there  
With no guarantee  
It seems to me  
At least it should be fair  
  
But if it's only tears and pain  
Isn't it still worth the cost  
Like some sweet saving grace  
Or a river we must cross  
If we don't understand  
What this life is made of  
We learn the truth  
When we find that kind of love  
Cause when innocence is lost  
There is not faith enough  
We learn the truth  
When we find that kind of love


What'll I do when you  
Are far away  
And I'm so blue,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do when I  
Am wondering who  
Is kissing you,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just  
A photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just  
A photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true,  
What'll I do?


When God dips his pen of love in my heart  
And he writes my soul a message he wants me to know  
His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
Well sometimes though the way is dreary, dark and cold  
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal  
I go to God in prayer, I can always find him there  
To whisper sweet peace to my soul  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way  
And gave his life completely to bring a better day  
My life was steeped in sin but in love he took me in  
His blood washed away every stain  
  
I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
He made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart


Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
You justify yourself in your love for someone else  
When you say, I never loved you anyway  
Your vows were made in vain, although my love still remains  
Though you broke my heart in two, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed  
'Til the day she was asking you to stay  
You turned your head from the tears I've shed  
Though you broke a heart in two, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  


You may walk away in anger  
Wear your heart upon your sleeve  
You make act like it don't matter  
Keep me laughing while you leave  
But burning bridges won't get me back  
If you change your mind some day  
Why can't we turn this scene around  
Before you walk away?  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
You may turn away in silence  
While the tears run down your face  
Say there's nothing left to bind us  
Leaving love without a trace  
But if I loved you well  
You'd soon find out why your new love falls some day  
Why can't we burn this heartache down  
Before you walk away?  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
  


God's given us years of happiness here  
Now we must part  
And as the angels come and call for you  
The pains of grief tug at my heart  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey  
  
Oh the days will be empty  
The nights so long without you my love  
And when god calls for you I'm left alone  
But we will meet in heaven above  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey  
  
Fond memories I'll keep of happy ways  
That on earth we trod  
And when I come we will walk hand in hand  
As one in heaven in the family of god  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey


Hear a new girl moved to the town  
Now your baby just ain't no where to be found  
Now you think you're in dispair - no  
You feel that chill - that cold black clinging in the air  
  
Love's a game - you're in it  
And you're so proud  
Someone you can depend on  
Someone you can rely on  
No matter what you say  
You won't come  
Running back to you're arms  
It's all over baby  
Well it don't do no good to cry  
  
How do think I felt when you  
Let me stay here never once said that we're through  
You didn't fight it all the way, no  
But I don't care - you just don't mean that much to me this way  
  
Love's a game - you're in it  
And you're so proud  
Someone you can depend on  
Someone you can rely on  
No matter what you say  
You won't come  
Running back to you're arms  
It's all over baby  
Well it don't do no good to cry  
  
[solo]  
  
Love's a game - you're in it  
And you're so proud  
Someone you can depend on  
Someone you can rely on  
No matter what you say  
You won't come  
Running back to you're arms  
It's all over baby  
Well it don't do no good to cry


Don't come around here no more,  
Bringing me all of your bad rain.  
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own.  
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain,  
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?  
There was a time we had a good thing going on,  
You and I both know the reason why it all went wrong.  
Tried to stick by you, help you see it through,  
But you used me all up, now you're on your own.  
So, don't come around here no more,  
Bringing me all of your bad rain.  
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own.  
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain,  
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?  
Well I tried and tried again, to be good to you,  
But you won't a hear a word and I don't know what it's coming to.  
Comes a time when you just have to turn and, walk away,  
There's nothing left to do, nothing left to say.  
So, don't come around here no more,  
Bringing me all of your bad rain.  
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own.  
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain,  
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?  
I ain't someone to be preaching to nobody else,  
Ain't going to try and pretend to be living that clean myself.  
Can't stand by and watch you throw your life away,  
But there's nothing left to do, nothing left to say.  
So, don't come around here no more,  
Bringing me all of your bad rain.  
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own.  
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain,  
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?  
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?


By The Hourglass  
  
Waiting in the rain at the station,  
Standing by the train,  
Looks like you're comin home to stay.  
It's been quite a while since you've seen him,  
Now, inside you smile against the rain,  
Cause you still feel the same.  
  
But, you're gonna cry, and search for the reason why,  
Carry your pain and you'll finally go insane.  
Uh, cause you, baby,  
Whoa, you been gone much too long.  
  
You can't believe there's no one there to greet ya now,  
You can't believe that no one cares,  
To take your hand, you want your man.  
  
But, you're gonna cry, and search for the reason why,  
Carry your pain and you'll finally go insane.  
Uh, cause you, baby,  
Whoa, you been gone much too long.  
Yeah, baby, much too long.  
Whoa, much too long.  
You went away a long time ago.


Silent shadows of the night  
Faded with the morning light  
We just wrote another song  
Maybe a word or two is wrong  
There's so much that could be said  
It's hard to write it in a line  
But when the final word is read  
Maybe something could be said  
For all the brothers of the road  
Just like you, we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we don't lose we're bound to win  
  
Somehow they gave it all a name  
Just like a southern hurricane  
We play our music like a storm  
They say a brand new sound was born  
We're all brothers of the road  
Just like you, we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we don't lose we're bound to win  
  
Some of us fell along the way  
We came together, not too proud to pray  
But the music must go on  
So there's no one left out there all alone  
We're just brothers of the road  
Casting shadows in the night  
Big wheels rolling on and on  
But everything's gonna be all right


Another day in the life of a stranger  
Surrounded by four walls that can't be seen  
He knows this dude that lives uptown and he delivers  
He often calls him for that perfect dream  
But oh, he's got his demons  
And they stay right by his side  
Through his everyday hell, yeah  
  
He loves his wine and his pretty women  
He buys them everything just to stay around  
He's got it made cause his daddy's got a bundle  
He seldom reaches out but there's no one to be found  
Except oh, he's still got them demons  
And they stay right by his side  
In his man-made hell  
  
Oh, he's got his demons  
And they by his side  
Another dar in the life of the lonely  
All alone in a sold out crowd  
He can always buy some cheap thrills with his money  
His world of silence has become much too loud  
But ho, don't forget them demons  
They're still right by his side  
Causing all kinds of hell, yeah


Yeah sad eyed woman  
Boogie 'til the break of dawn  
Yeah long a-bout the break of day yeah  
Oh your man has up and gone  
  
You got thirteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
Yeah the doctor keep [or "kept"] calling  
Woah found you'd fall-en  
[alternate lyrics: found you bawlin']  
Yeah you backed him in the corner  
Oh you're doing what you want to  
  
You got fourteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
You got fifteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
Yeah the doctor keep [or "kept"] calling  
Woah found you'd fall-en  
[alternate lyrics: found you bawlin']  
Yeah you backed him in the corner  
Oh you're doing what you want to  
  
You got sixteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
Oh yeah  
Sad eyed woman

For a pretty good while

Since I was just a little baby child

But for a little while tonight everything gonna be all right  
When that good time feelin come around

Mama stood cryin' at the back door  
Papa's lacin' on his leavin' shoes  
Little Joe's blowin' on the horn outdoors  
I've seen enough, I can't take no more  
And I'm leavin'  
  
Might go to Philadelphia, PA  
Might wind up in Boston, I just can't say  
Got my axe in one hand  
Got my Greyhound ticket in the other hand  
And I'm leavin'  
  
I tell you I'm leavin'  
Gonna play my blues  
Yes I'm leavin'  
Got nothing to lose  
Well, I'm dying to get the hell out of here  
Right away  
  
Mama stood cryin' at the back door  
Papa's lacin' on his leavin' shoes  
Little Joe's blowin' on the horn outdoors  
I've seen enough, I can't take no more  
And I'm leavin'  
  
I said I'm leavin'  
Gonna play my guitar  
I'm leavin'  
Don't care if I'm a big star  
I'm leavin' this old ghetto  
Right away, right away


Well, now, times got hard  
And I didn't draw the card I needed  
So, I proceeded to bang it on down the line  
Hitchhike, turnpike  
And if you got room, won't you let me ride?  
Just as far as you're going  
And, Lord knowing, I'll be much obliged  
  
There was a light rain falling  
I started recalling how lonesome a man can be  
Feeling a chill when over the hill  
Came a brand new baby blue Cadillac  
Stop on a dime  
I threw my guitar in the back, and I climbed inside  
Big blue eyes said, "Hey, boy, don't you want a ride?"  
  
I said, "To Birmingham, Alabama  
Or to Nashville, Tennessee will do just fine with me  
Don't you know what I mean?  
I'm coming from New Orleans  
Now, hey  
Mama, won't you let me ride?"  
  
Well, now, black fur coat, diamond ring  
Shining like something I ain't ever seen  
My old guitar and a roadside bar  
Walked in the door looking like a movie queen  
There was a honky-tonk jukebox, hardwood floor  
She said, "I ain't ever seen nothing like this before."  
I said, "That's all right, mama, won't you let me ride?"  
  
On down to Birmingham, Alabama  
Or to Nashville, Tennessee will do fine with me  
Don't you know what I mean?  
I'm coming from New Orleans  
Now, hey  
Mama, won't you let me ride?"


This city mean old world, try livin' by yourself  
This city mean old world, try livin' by yourself  
Can't get the one you love, have to use somebody else  
  
I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go  
I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go  
Guess you don't love me, lovin' mister so and so  
  
Solo (Two times)  
  
Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold  
Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold  
I guess you don't love me, gonna pack my things and go  
  
Solo (to end)


Well I love you baby, but you won't give me the time of day.  
Well I love you baby, but you won't give me the time of day.  
Treat me so bad, but I love you anyway.  
Early in the morning sun begins to rise,  
Early in the morning sun begins to rise,  
Call out your name, wring my hands and cry  
Got me runnin', don't know what to do,  
There won't be much of me when you get through.  
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose,  
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues.  
Well, I love you baby, but you don't even know my name.  
Well, I love you baby, but you don't even know my name.  
Don't care about me but love you just the same.  
Now, someday baby, take you by the hand,  
Yeah, someday baby, take you by the hand,  
You be my lovin' child and I'll be your lovin' man.  
Yeah, you got me runnin', don't know what to do,  
There won't be much of me when you get through.  
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose,  
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues.  
Got me runnin', don't know what to do,  
There won't be much of me when you get through.  
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose,  
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues.


Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Wish that tornado would blow my blues away.  
Lord, I can tell my bulldog  
when I hear him bark  
Lord, I can tell my baby  
when I hear her in the dark.  
Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Lord I wish a tornado would blow my blues away.


Walk me out in the morning dew, my heart  
Walk me out in the morning dew, my heart  
You know I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my heart  
Oh, I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my heart  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry at all  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry at all  
Now there is no morning dew  
Now there is no morning dew  
What they've been saying all these years has come true  
What they've been saying all these years has come true  
Got no morning dew, oh  


Well I don't know, if I dreamed it.  
I don't know, might be real.  
Lord, it's so strange, how one will find another,  
But I keep on searchin', cause I know you're out there,  
And all I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - the mystery woman.  
Cause I'm confused, but only sometimes.  
Patiently waiting, baby just for you.  
But I'll be leavin', babe, I won't go under.  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - a mystery woman.  
  
If I have to chase her, all around the country.  
Well I'm bound to find her somewhere, and that's no lie.  
Ain't it strange, how one will find another,  
But I'll keep on searchin', cause I know you're out there,  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - a mystery woman.  
All I gotta do, is open my eyes and see you - my mystery woman.  
Hey, yeah - my mystery woman.


Oh-oh  
  
Walking in the midnight rain  
Thought I heard a southbound train  
Call your name  
Nancy  
  
Walking in the rain all day  
Guess there wasn't nobody goin' my way  
They didn't stop at all  
But I will get back to you if I have to crawl  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didn't appear to be no better at all  
And this ol' highway's a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Oh Nancy  
I'll get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah  
  
[solo]  
  
Oh yeah, mmmmm  
  
I left my home for a job in the city  
It's a crying shame  
It's a pity  
It ain't livin' at all  
Nobody knows my name  
They don't even give a thang about me t'all  
Nancy  
Baby I'm getting back to you if I have to crawl  
Ohh  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didn't appear to be no better at all  
This ol' highway's a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Nancy  
Baby I'll get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah yeah oh oh  
Oh Nancy  
Oh Nancy


I need someone's hand to lead me through the night  
Need someone's arms, to love and squeeze me real tight.  
And when the lights are low, when it's time to go,  
I need your love so bad.  
I need some soft lips to hold so close to mine  
Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin  
When the lights are low, and when it's time to go,  
I need your love so bad.  
So give it up, and bring it on home to me.  
Oh you can write it on a paper so it can be read to me.  
Tell me you love me, stop drivin' me mad,  
Cause I need your love so bad.  
I needed some voice, to take me through the night,  
Don't you worry baby, I will not fuss and fight.  
Well listen to my plea, now bring it on home to me,  
Cause I need your love so bad.  
Well, I need your love soooo bad.  
Soooo bad. So baaad. Soooooo bad.

Time and time again I've felt these wall's of plaster,  
Closing in,  
And more than once I've felt that lonely lonely feeling,  
Wondering why and where I've been,  
Just about the time, I think I can't hold on,  
You're always there to keep me hanging on and I say,  
  
I never knew how much a man needed a woman  
(no I never)  
I never knew how much a boy needed a girl  
(needed a girl)  
I never knew how much I needed you  
  
Day after day I join the rat race,  
Tryin' to make the most of it,  
I keep on falling down down the ladder,  
Still trying to stay on top of it,  
Just when I was sure,  
Nothing could get no better,  
Oh I realize,  
I still love you more than ever,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Today I watch the sun set on the freeway,  
Strangled on the poison air,  
But miles beyond, on the other end,  
I know, you'll always be waiting there,  
Girl you treat me,  
With your kindest hand,  
And in my heart, in my mind,  
And I'm so glad  
  
[Chorus:]


As I was motivating back towards town  
I seen a Cadillac sign, it said no money down  
So I eased on the brake, and I pulled up there in the drive  
I gunned up the motor and then I walked on inside  
The dealer came down and said man trade that Ford  
I can put you in a car that will eat up the road  
Now you just tell me what you want  
And then sign on this line  
I'll have it brought right to your house  
In about an hour's time  
  
I'm gonna get me a car  
And I'm gonna head on down the road  
Ain't gonna have to worry no more  
Bout that broke down raggity Ford  
  
Well mister I want a yellow convertible a four door deville  
Man I want a continnetial spare and some white chrome wheels  
And power steering and uh a power brakes  
And a powerful motor with a jet off take  
Some nice cool air condition and some nice warm heat  
And a big old feather bedroom pillow in the back seat  
I want a ship to shore radio a colour tv and a phone  
So I can talk to my honey while I'm riding alone  
  
I wanna get me a car yeah  
And head on down the road  
I don't have to worry no more

And also I want four carburetors and I want two straight exhaust  
I want a nuclear reactor and I don't care what it cost

And I want a 15 year guarantee on everything that I got

You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
  
Can't you feel a cold wind, howlin' down, blowin' my song  
Can't you feel a cold wind, it's howlin' down, blowin' my song  
Well I ain't an old man, oh but you know my time ain't long  
  
Gonna be a hard rain - you can hear it in the distance, sounds so near  
Gonna be a hard rain - can't you hear it in the distance, sounds so near  
People when the rain comes, oh it's gonna wash us all away from here  
  
Mean old woman, people won't you tell me where can she be  
Mean old woman, oh people won't you tell me where can she be  
She's the only woman, oh that ever meant a damn to me  
  
You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
Tell me now old friend, when you gonna let, this poor man be?


Sunset colors, all across the bay.  
Finds me here alone at the end of one more day.  
Skipping stones across the water.  
Wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Palm trees sway in the evening breeze.  
Sing a lullabye of sweet love to me.  
Sailboat, sail away into the amber sky.  
And I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
May all your dreams come true one day.  
Sail on, sail away.  
I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
May all your dreams come true one day.  
Sail on, sail away.  
I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
Sail on, sail away.  
Sail on, sail away.  
Sail on, sail away.


Lately I don't know where I went wrong,  
But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong,  
Between her fine perfume and angel face,  
My whole world became another place.  
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong,  
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong.  
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door.  
I could not wait to hear the siren song,  
The beginning of the end of my happy home.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo,  
too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Heard them say the payback's double-fold,  
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold.  
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year,  
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole.  
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old.  
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox,  
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop.  
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul,  
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.


I've had my troubles,  
I know you've had your troubles too.  
Sometimes when you need a little sunshine,  
It keeps rainin' down on you.  
  
But I'm not gonna let it get me down,  
Keep on pullin', things are gonna come around.  
Shine it on,  
Shine it on.  
  
Little blue-eyed woman,  
She made me feel so fine.  
She got what she wanted,  
Then she moved on down the line.  
  
Yes I know about the pain,  
Tears are gonna fall,  
Just like rain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Shine it on,  
Look around you see what's goin' on.  
Shine it on,  
Before you end up out there on your own.  
Don't let some rainy day, steal your heart away,  
You got to go on,  
It's just the dark before the dawn,  
Shine it on.  
  
Shine it on,  
Look around you see what's goin' on.  
Shine it on,  
Before you end up out there on your own.  
  
Don't let some rainy day, steal your heart away,  
Shine it on,  
Look around you see what's goin' on.  
Shine it on,  
  
Before you end up out there on your own.  
Shine it on, oh baby.  
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on,  
Shine it on.


You've heard every line before  
My life's a revolving door  
With no way out and no way in  
You know just what's on my mind  
Could you take a chance one more time  
Maybe we could start all over again  
  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
  
Your eyes can't tell a lie  
I can see what you're feeling inside  
Don't give up before we start  
?Cause this time love is  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
  
I know what they're telling you  
I wish I could say that it's not true  
Love is so hard to find  
But I never took the time  
I never let you in  
Please let me try again  
Straight from the heart  
  
I thought I knew about love  
But I didn't know at all  
Didn't take the time to see  
Until I started to fall  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  


Whatever happened to good time Sally  
I don't see her 'round no more  
She used to be all over me  
It ain't like that no more  
Sally had the best game there was in town  
Now the good girl just can't be found  
Whatever happened to good time Sally  
I don't see her 'round no more  
  
The heat is on, everybody has gone underground  
The heat is on, everybody hiding out just like Jesse James  
My old home town  
Lord, it don't seem the same  
  
Well, I walked in this place, I was just lookin' for a game  
Everybody here wanted to know my name  
I said hush, hush up your mouth, I'll introduce my own self  
To this house  
I was born in the back woods, I was raised up like a slave  
Having me a good time now is all I crave  
I spotted me a barroom queen, skin tight blue jeans  
That same old midnight show  
I took her to the side and I said I won't be satisfied  
Until you tell me everything you know  
  
Whatever happened to big time Buddy  
I don't see him 'round no more  
I heard tell that they got him in jail  
But I don't know what they got him for  
They caught him with an airplane  
Talkin' 'bout some cocaine  
Nobody knows for sure  
Whatever happened to good time Buddy  
I don't see hem 'round no more  
  
The heat is on, everybody has gone underground  
The heat is on, everybody hiding out just like Jesse James  
My old home town  
Lord, it don't seem the same


The Weight  
  
I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past DEAD  
I just need some place where I can lay my head  
Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed  
He just grinned and shook my hand, "No" was all he said.  
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny, and you put the load right on me  
I picked up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide  
Then I saw old Carmen and the devil walking side by side  
I said, "Hey Carmen, c'mon, let's go downtown"  
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around"  
  
Chorus  
  
Go down, Miss moses, ain't nothin you can say  
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on judgement day  
Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Annalee  
He said, "Do me a favor, so, won't you stay and keep Annalee comapany"  
  
Chorus  
  
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog  
Said, "I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog"  
I said, "Wait a minute Chester-you know, I'm a peaceful man"  
He said, "That's ok, boy, won't you feed him when you can"  
  
Chorus  
  
Get you cannonball, now to take me down the line  
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time  
To get back to miss Fanny, you know she's the only one  
Who sent me here, with her regards for everyone  
  
Chorus


Well here you come again  
Claiming to be my long lost friend  
I can tell you're wearing thin  
You're trying to play those same old evil tricks again  
  
No, no nobody  
Not even you, babe  
No, no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do  
  
A wise man tried to warn me  
But I would not hear a word  
Just can't say that I feel badly  
About all the bridges I have burned  
  
No, no nobody  
Not even you, babe  
No, no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do  
  
If you knew someone like I know you  
You can hear their footsteps  
And know exactly who they are  
You ain't worthy my time or money  
Much less my heart  
Yet here you are again  
Who the hell do you think you are  
  
You've got a million dollar smile  
And a half-a-dollar soul  
You're a living lesson baby  
And your story's getting old  
  
No, no nobody  
Not even you, babe  
No, no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do


You're coming back into my life  
After all this time apart  
After my heart has been broken in two  
Now you want to turn around and go back through  
All the hurt, all the pain  
I'm not sure it could ever be the same  
  
'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong  
I've spend so many nights alone  
One kiss can't make it disappear  
Even though you're here tonight  
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone  
  
I guess you think it's all a game  
Someone gets hurt, someone gets blamed  
You don't seem to realize  
There's someone else  
In my eyes  
  
'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong  
I've spend so many nights alone  
One kiss can't make it disappear  
Even though you're here tonight  
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone  
  
You're the one who wanted to play the field  
Now you can't find a love that's real  
It's your game, but it's no fun  
When you end up the lonely one  
  
'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong  
I've spend so many nights alone  
One kiss can't make it disappear  
Even though you're here tonight  
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone


Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything  
Everything that money could buy  
But the man told so many lies  
There's another man over there  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
Word got around that he had jilted her  
Men came running from near and far  
Should've never been so foolish  
Guess I'll never  
But the man that's got her now  
He's a lucky so and so  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
I remember the other day, about a week ago  
She said, "I don't even want to talk to you  
'Cause I don't love you anymore"  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything, tried to keep him satisfied  
But the man told so many lies  
There's another man over there  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  


You don't love me, pretty baby,  
You don't love me, yes I know.  
You don't love me, pretty baby  
You don't love me, yes I know.  
  
Well if you leave me, pretty baby  
Don't you know you're gonna hurt me so.  
Well I'm gonna tell my mother,  
I'm gonna talk to my father too.  
Well I'm gonna tell my sweet mother,  
I'll have a word with my father too.  
Well I'm gonna tell everybody,  
What those young girls will do to you.  
  
Goodbye now, pretty baby,  
If I don't see you no more.  
Lord, goodbye now, pretty baby,  
If I never see you no more.  
Well if you think I'll be your fool, Lord,  
You better be on your merry way.


Acrobats and comets floating by so fast  
Children's faces smile like suns at last  
Lilac butterflies are cruising without fear  
All inviting you to stay and rest here  
  
You can halt your car for an afternoon in utopia  
We shall stop the wars on those afternoons in utopia  
Mighty Mao moondog drifts across the grass  
Healing lullabies for easter time on mars  
  
Paint your hats and shoues with flowers and with stars  
Singing in metropolitan operas  
You can halt your car for an afternoon in utopia  
We shall stop the wars on those afternoons in utopia


Ain't it strange that we destroy  
What we embrace  
And we leave  
What we seek  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange that we smile  
When we cry  
And no one knows why we are here  
And where we going to  
Ain't it strange  
We could be, we could be so good together  
Ain't it strange that we share what we hate  
That we break what we love  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange when we pray, we betray anyway  
And no one knows what we are for  
Why we're so tough  
When we're so fragile  
Ain't it strange  
  
Ain't it strange, still we could fall into a dream, I'd wish no one  
Will catch that fall  
For we could fall for love, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
All the tears in the world not in vain for the pain is gone, the  
Shame is washed away  
When we're all one, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
It's hard to believe after thousands of years  
The world is still drowning in blood and tears  
We've been quite advanced but again we fail  
It is dog eats dog on the ratrace trail  
It is getting too much and we're getting nowhere  
While hatred and fear is all that we share  
I can't take it no more when I'm watching the news  
We must stick together or we're bound to lose


Show me a place that ain't hell  
If there's space, give me room to breathe  
That's all that I need for this body can't fail  
And if music be the food of love  
Play on, give me excess of it  
Let it all out, please let me out of here  
And I shall rise from the ashes  
  
Grow like a rose from the ruins  
There must be light in the darkness  
Hope at the end of the night  
Yes, I've been tryin' all my  
Life to get to heaven  
But awoke in the eye of the storm  
But I shall rise from the ashes  
Grow from the ruins and return back home  
  
This is a call from the goals coming up  
To the prisoners of pleasure  
Drunk on the blood of the next generations  
And I've been through many strange confusions  
Splitting myself into to many faces  
Now the mirror is broken  
I can see the worms behind  
You may well have your ways of triumph  
You may well have your ways of truth  
  
Just gimme some room to breathe  
That's all that I need  
Me and my strange friends  
We all belong to the grand astral body  
Take my hand and I take you out of here  
And there's you behind those legendary curtains  
Take my hand before you wither in the crowd  
  
And I take you out of here  
This is the end of the show I don't know  
Was I wrong was I right  
Oh love, I don't know, I wasn't perfect for sure  
But now I feel like a new born baby  
Lying in the dew of the morning  
Laughing at the sky like a brave new Apollo


Driving down the streets, listening to the radio  
What do I get: ariana  
Reading the papers and the news they scream  
Haven't you heard: ariana  
She rules the business, she's sucha restless genuine juvenile  
Everyone knows, wherever she goes  
She got chique, she got class, she got style  
Arianamaniacs rulr the world, haven't you heard  
Arianamania sets the scenes on fire  
We're goin' nutz for ariana  
We're goin' carazzy forrr herrr  
Everything glows, wherever she goes  
She got sex from her lips to her toes  
All the casanovas, even zombies agree  
With the hummingbirds and the beasts from the sea  
Ariana's a real sensation  
When will she be on the screeeeeen


These are the days of evil perfection  
This is the world of torture and fame  
This is the age of most vicious infection  
These are the times of terror and pain  
  
Let them inside and they build you a nightmare  
Show them, you fool, it'll not be in vain  
Here is your costume of deepest surrender  
These are the times of terror and pain  
  
I want to ride on a crest of sensation  
I want to scream in the whirlpools of love  
I want to drown in a climax of thunder  
I want to be with the fools in the storm  
  
Do what you want and then die when you want to  
We're gonna walk on the blood of the meek  
We're gonna sail through the oceans of wonder  
We're gonna live in the dreams that we seek  
  
Send in the parasite clowns on their horses  
Send in the idiots and let them advance  
Send in the monsters of your own creation  
Send them all in and give them a chance  
  
We're gonna dance to the sweetest of music  
We're gonna play with the whores in the rain  
We'll dissipate the lord's last temptations  
All in a crossfire of torture and fame


she sits by the window, stares into the night  
just waiting for a foreign sound from outside  
far beyond the atmospheres, she is listening for a call to take her homewards  
to herself  
oh, i love you so  
he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you in the morning  
she knows that the pavement's hard, there between the stars  
to travel on to martian homesick city  
she is weeping silently but there's not a tear  
just raindrops falling from the painted ceiling  
the dance of the foraging bee will number all the things  
she has been longing for all of her life  
i will not pass this night in vain, she says  
i'll stand this kind of rain  
i know the way, i'll find the path  
yes, carol wants to go to mars, back where the red-cold sun is sinking  
to the channels of a'daar  
day breaks through the grating  
someone moves a chair  
and sunlight blisters dazzling on a glass  
take a pill and greet the day for sedative holidays  
why aren't you sleeping in the night  
oh, i love you so  
he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you till the evening  
we shall meet tomorrow night  
and i'll kiss you just as tenderly as cygnus kissed the deserts


Pushing through the market square  
So many mothers sighing  
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in  
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying  
Cried so much, his face was wet, then I knew, he was not lying  
  
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies  
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and tv's  
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store, everything in there  
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people  
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
  
A girl of my age went off her head, hit some tiny children  
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them  
A soldier with a broken arm  
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest  
And a queer threw up at the sight of that  
  
I think I saw you in an icecream parlour  
Drinking milkshakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine  
I don't think you knew you were in this song  
And it was cold and it raind, so I felt like an actor  
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there  
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk  
  
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes, we've got five years, what a surprise  
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot, we've got five years, that's all
we've got  
We've got five years...


I forgive, I forgive  
I forgive all my friends who left me alone, I forgive the wall that it had so
many stones  
I forgive the lord that he never sent a priest, I forgive the hangman, I
forgive the beast  
I forgive the winter that it was so cold, I forgive my father that he was so
bold  
I forgive the ashes that they couldn't stay flames, I forgive the acid, I
forgive the rains  
I forgive James Joyce that I couldn't read his books,  
I forgive that you've never given back what you took  
  
I forgive the puzzle that I didn't fit, I forgive the shit that I couldn't
write a hit  
I forgive the dog that she never came home, I forgive all the ways that they
always lead to rome  
I forgive the worm in the very last tree, I forgive the girls who haven't
forgiven me  
I forgive inspiration when it came to late, I forgive all the ladies when I
had to wait  
I forgive superman that I didn't stay clean, I forgive, I forgive, anyone,
anything  
For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love  
  
I forgive the angels who could never take me high,  
I forgive all my dreams that I couldn't really fly  
I forgive the thought that I couldn't stop thinking,  
I forgive all the drinks that I couldn't stop drinking  
  
I forgive the clock that it didn't wake me up, I forgive the driver, I forgive
the cab  
I forgive all the moments that they wouldn't stay, I forgive all the years
that they've flown away  
I forgive the promises that they've been broken, I forgive the curses that
they have been spoken  
I forgive all the prophets and the saints of the past, I forgive the stars
when they fell too fast  
I forgive the joke that it didn't make me laugh, I forgive desire that I had
to starve  
I forgive all the love for the sake of love, I forgive all sakes for the fake
above  
For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love


Let's start in style, let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies.  
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
Let us die young or let us live forever  
We don't have the power, but we never say never  
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
Can you imagine when this race is won?  
Turn our golden faces into the sun,  
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune  
The music's played by the madman.  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever, and ever  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever young.  
  
Some are like water, some are like the heat  
Some are a melody and some are the beat  
Sooner or later they all will be gone  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
It's so hard to get old without a cause  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse  
Youth's like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever  
  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play  
So many dreams swinging out of the blue  
Oh let them come true  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever young?  
  
Forever young  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?


Be on your guard when you sit in the open places  
because I'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun  
when tigers, palmtrees, rattlesnakes unfold their graces  
that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from  
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways  
and angels burn to dust before the human race  
we're giants under a rainbow  
we're stranded east of eden  
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow  
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them  
freedom that is what you are always screaming  
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh  
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming  
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies  
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die  
freedom...  
Freedom...


I wish I'd had the time to look into your eyes  
And quietly say the words  
The words that you'd expect  
I wish I'd touched your face  
And you would hold my hand  
Then tears were on our guard  
And silence was our friend  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
I dreamt I had the time to listen what you'd say  
And what you'd say was true and we could start anew  
I saw u bachstage in that chair  
Dressed up in lies but oh so fair  
And then I took you by the hand and off we went  
And we just drank to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do  
And all the poems that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memory to behold without explanations...  
And we just drink to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too without explanations..  
To be told.


Though this place is so crowded  
You feel so alone 'cause you're eye to eye with him  
And you know he will take you  
He's got nothing to lose and there's no way for you to win  
Desperados in love won't kill this sweet dove  
For nuggets of fleeting bliss  
C'mon, c'mon you can't escape  
The bleeding bullet of a kiss  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine  
It's a new situation  
The start of a game, you've already won the prize  
He's a lunatic dancer  
Who's not aware that he's skating on thin ice  
There's no turning back  
No time for regrets, you should've known better, though  
Another chance to fall in love  
Another chance to turn you on  
Another chance to turn you on  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine


Be my guard just for tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Take me under your wing, I can't make it anymore  
I am so full of fear, may you read a book to me  
And when the shadows grow, won't you stay with me  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I need to know  
Be my guard beside my bed, that is all I need to know  
Will you please hold my hand, don't you ever let it go  
All the wonders of the world  
For a little second more  
I can't speak but can't you see  
It's your touch I'm crying for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I need to know  
Be my guard just until dawn  
When I can hear the birds again  
I'm as helpless as can be  
Will you guard my little flame  
If we never meet again  
You shall always keep in mind  
That you were my guard tonight  
That you were my guard tonight  
Will you be my guard tonight


We call ourselves the crown of creation  
I wonder what does it mean  
We're not the owners of the moon and the earth  
It's like a roundabout  
And it goes round and round for free  
We've made some gruesome inventions  
Yet we're mastered by those systems  
We're endangered danger, we're running out of fashion  
If we don't care for responsibility, hey-hey  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger  
Eric says that we're a lonely species  
That's why we're playing the fools  
But once we'll enter the aquarian age  
I sometimes catch him floating in his swimming-pool  
He says  
If we'd tune in to our brighter sides  
We'd feel like Jesus on the waters  
Cause we're sailors not soldiers  
So much more for this show  
Than a guest-appearance in the universe, here we go  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger


Now at the station, the train to another land  
Lands of never seen light  
Light hidden in infinite night  
Night in it's biggest might, might of the strongest power  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
The waiting room of kingdom come,  
I look back upon my life  
Life of loss but now the end  
End of rat race overdrive  
Overdrive to foreign lands  
Lands of contemptuous hours  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
Now on the train  
This is the end of my day  
I feel my spirits escape like a musical clock  
That's dying away  
I turn once again and wave my hand  
And say goodbye  
I never thought it's so easy  
I never thought it's so easy  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
i take the first train to the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower


Once I awoke  
The shadow of your smile had crossed my mind  
How could I know this was your last goodbye  
That's slipping through the windmills of the night  
  
You never understand when she's talking to you,  
Little boy  
You never understand when she's talking to you  
She's too far away  
  
Is it heaven or hell  
We're drifting in the wake of our dreams  
And the world is a clown who cries  
And no one can tell is it real  
Once I cried  
  
Whenever I awoke without you  
A stranger in the thunder of the dark  
I'm praying to the sun to shine tonite  
You never understand when she's talking to you,  
  
Mon amour  
You never understand when she's talking to you  
She's too far away...


When you feel so far away  
Though you're close to everything  
And the feeling of estrangement's  
Creeping up on spider's legs  
Even in these days of wonder  
Even in the age of faith  
There are some who goin' under  
There are some who got it made  
In the middle of the night  
When the last of god has died  
And the only thing you've got  
Is the tic toc of the clock  
I'm here by your side  
In these days full of wonder  
So you passed so many years  
In a labyrinth of traces  
Running round and round they led  
To no one but yourself


If you open up the cage  
You will hurt yourself  
The king said it's forbidden  
Or you may get hell  
But the prisoner lets you know  
Where to find the key  
Under her satin pillow  
Yes, there it has to be  
Modesty is fine but it doesn't take you very far  
When you make your decision  
Don't be afraid of the dark  
Longing for the golden ball  
That it will be yours for keeps  
Be sure about it as you saw  
So shall you reap  
  
Lets take a ride on Iron John's shoulders  
He has more gold than anybody in this world  
Lets take a ride, hey-ho on Iron John  
He has more gold  
Than anybody in this world  
  
Jump on the train to nowhere  
From now on you are free  
After rising from the ashes  
You'll become a mystery  
Too many of those strange injections, too many gazes at the sun  
The lady says, well that's the business, running after No. 1  
For all their childish daydreams you caught their falling stars  
Just for the cheapest contracts you signed your autographs  
And if you started much too early, therefore you stopped too late  
Make sure no one can stop you now, here comes the ultimate  
  
Lets take a ride  
  
He will be with you, he will be there when you call out the magic words  
  
Lets take a ride


Here is the news from my little hideaway  
My sweet Ivory Tower  
I've sent you songs about so many thing  
Mighty moon dogs skipping waves  
Dolphins playing their lives away  
Golden circus girls and pharaohs  
Fallen angels, street side Romeos  
  
Patricia's park and Anyway  
Eternal youth and never ending summer days  
Lonely girls, music halls, the mysteries of love  
In the event that I don't return  
Please take this message to understand  
In the event  
I am a stranger in a strange land  
  
Welcome, stranger, to the land of the free  
Welcome, Carol, to Phantasy  
Oh my God, I feel so alone  
A million light years far from home  
It seems to be a tragedy  
How can I live in Germany?  
  
Another house is burning down  
It's time to face the cruel reality  
This is a game no more  
Disasters in the 20th Century  
In the event that I don't return  
Please take this message to understand  
In the event that I don't return


At the edge of the moon there's a lonely man  
And he blows on his horn as strong as he can  
And the girl at the bar wipes the breath  
Of winter away with a smile of her face  
  
And a little black dog barks along with a loon  
Is this my appointment or did I come too soon  
Got a strange invitation for tea time  
'Twas given by somebody I can't recall  
  
It's the middle of the riddle, it's not very serious  
It's nothing but a big surprise  
And the president's horse is a rabbit of course  
That is living in a big boy's mind  
  
Living in a big boy's mind  
And I skate on a knife on a wire  
That is strung from this song to a distant shore  
And then I say  
  
Intuition is just another phase of chance  
While we're crawling through the old pyramid's floors  
(little pharaohs)  
And the little black dog, here it comes again  
  
It's a true companion in a foreign land  
On a quest for the valley of boojums  
And birthdays and phonecalls I cannot recall  
All of man shan't talk to the one at the helm  
  
And the man at the helm shall talk to no one  
Shall talk to no one at all  
(Rule 42)  
And a horse is a rabbit of course  
  
(yes, indeed)  
Yes, a horse is a rabbit of course


Once I was so sure, once I was so blind  
Wonder what you said if you read my mind  
Angel in a car, devil on a cross  
Scarecrows in the fields, Jesus on the rocks  
Letters in the rain, rabbit on the run  
God was made for you, lizards for the sun  
Monkey in the moon, I can see you through  
Monkey in the moon, this one's made for you  
  
  
Flower in a word, words without a priest  
Wings without a bird, beauty without beast  
Signal overkill, trains are overdue  
Fool upon a hill, ocean overview  
Letters in the rain. . .  
Fool upon a hill, trains are overdue  
Except what we forgot nothing's really new  
Head above the clouds, eyes are opened wide  
Windmill burning down, walk into the light  
Walk into the light  
Monkey in the moon...  
Letters in the rain  
This one's


you gave me strength, you pushed the blades away from me  
oh how we dreamt to change the world  
and we would never give in, no matter what they say  
a really cool connection in a cruel world  
you led me through the nights - and through the hardest fights  
we dreamt wed be the ones - and we would never lose  
you made me speechless - and fearless - yet it made you fearless too  
oh how we dreamt to be so fearless - no matter what they do  
i dont know where you are now - we shared a dream of being together  
you led me to the light, yeah - for this i would like to thank you forever  
moonboy...  
youve been around, a distant star, youve seen them come and go  
those unknown chaps without a slightest chance  
i know, all without faith are liars even when theyre dreaming  
id even put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
our minds are filled with crazy dreams - they seem to be unreachable  
but if you give them up they stay - till someone else takes them away  
i met you in this hotel hall - oh nino, aint it hard  
not to be understood  
but all you said was: hey, i just wanna sing (like an angel)  
i dont know where you are now - we shared a dream of being together  
you led me to the light, yeah - for this i would like to thank you forever  
moonboy...  
i dont know where you are now - you come and go whenever you like..  
just believe in your powers - you might find out youre invincible...  
no matter what they say...


Once, we were together  
Once we were one  
Once we were running, we knew where we came from  
We were the music, we heard the call  
We were giants after the fall  
Once we were children, once we were so small  
  
To the new horizons I cast my eyes  
When I look at you reaching out to the new horizons  
Once and today  
Once and today  
  
Once, we were divided, once, we lost our sight  
Once, we were freezing in the tv light  
You are a rainbow, you're looking fine  
Shall we make it one more time  
  
To the new horizons I cast my eyes  
When I look at you reaching out to the new horizons  
Once and today  
Once and today  
You are a rainbow


Baby, if you say you still care,  
I follow you most anywhere  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
And in the darkest night,  
I'll keep you safe and alright  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
Won't you roll away the stone,  
Why be cold and so alone  
Won't you roll away the stone,  
Don't you let it lie  
No matter if fools say we can't win,  
I know I'll fall in love again  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
So sing, we still got a chance,  
Baby for love and sweet romance  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
Won't you roll away the stone  
Don't you let it die  
Just kick it away


listen to the news, changes are coming soon  
atlantic engineers and cities in the moon  
you better look across the ocean, tell me what you see  
the southern cross explodes into the colours of the sea  
mighty maomoondog skips across the waves  
kick the door and hit the shore and be somebody else  
supersonic landscapes are melting in your hair  
bubblegum comediens planting skylarks in the air  
here we go with the new sensation  
we're on every station  
such a kind of a legend to turn you on  
dig that rhythm, genie and listen to the voice of the dolphins  
listen to your radio  
all across the planet, politicians tremble  
continental sister's rocking with the liquid gambler  
now the time is here, now it's coming true  
the enigmatic extasy is overwhelming you  
acrobats and comets are streaking by  
40.000 sirens are wailing at the sky  
innersexual circuits are cruising without fear  
all inviting you for partytiming here  
that's the start of the new sensation..  
...dig that band  
listen to me, listen to the voice of the dolphin  
you better return to the sea  
listen to his majesty  
you better return to the sea  
you better return to me..


There's no more place to go  
the other bars are closed  
the night the stranger came to town  
how do you know  
when you're right or wrong?  
How do you know  
if you hurt or if you don't?  
So many people say so many things  
but nobody agrees on anything  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this night's an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
you burned the book of life  
the cradle and the tomb  
how could you ever dare  
there's no more turning back  
your stars lit up in flames  
there's gunsmoke in the air  
and yesterday you bought a brand-new car  
but you don't feel like going very far  
there's no more place to go...  
There's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this night's an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
here they come...  
Shadows she said...  
And all the shadows followed after her...  
Shadows she said...


Did you know when the journey started  
That wed ever reach that point  
Many years we sailed together  
Now its time to say goodbye  
You don't know what I've been going through  
haven't heard that much from you  
Isolation is a nice flower  
Now I wonder what to do  
You never know when your dreams come true  
Is it good for you, is it good for you  
On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before  
When you told me that youre leaving  
Cause the stakes were much too high  
I was wondring why you said so  
Since we still got wings to fly  
I will never ever give up  
Just as long as I am here  
Till the end Ill spread my wings  
And raise my dreams against your fears  
You never know when your dreams come true  
Is it good for you, is it good for you  
On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before...


Tell me is it really true  
There's something goin' on  
Outside  
I just can feel it  
I heard it on the radio  
I'm not allowed to go  
Outside  
I can't believe it  
There's a big hole in the sky  
Where the radiation's breaking through  
And we just sit and stare  
Like the rabbit at the snake  
There's so much we could do  
But we gotta do it now  
Cause it's gettin' pretty late  
Better hurry now  
We all need the sun  
We need love and light for everyone  
We need our atmosphere  
To live in here  
We could be so strong  
We overthrow the government and stop  
What's goin' wrong  
We're fighting for the sun  
It's really hard to understand  
The change of sister sun  
As if your sunny smile  
Would turn into a deadly one  
It's not a quality of life  
To live inside a mighty trap  
To have that ice-cold coke beyond the radiation gap  
There should be more resistance  
Against industrial trusts  
And if there's no solution, there should be revolution  
I wonder if we start in time, we're racing with the seconds  
I wonder if we've got enough to talk to stupid politicians  
We all need the sun...  
Hold on to revolution... Members of the earth, lets fighting for the sun

There is too much confusion  
Much too much impact of obscene terror  
I wonder why I'm still surfing on this wave of obsession  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for some cool messiah  
Give me a reason to stay here forever  
Waiting for something to come  
Is it my soul  
Is it that glimpse of light I never forget to expect  
Or is it you, some kind of angel  
That keeps me in waiting forever  
There's too much war on the outside  
Much too much impact of symbols and meanings  
I wonder why I'm still fighting in this ocean of questions  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for something to come  
Give me a reason to stay on this island  
Waiting for something to come


It's a trick of my mind  
Two faces bathing in the screen light  
She's so soft and warm in my arms  
I tune it into the scene  
My hands are resting on her shoulders  
When were dancing away for a while  
Oh we're moving, we're falling,  
We step into the fire  
By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream  
There's no reason to hurry  
Just start that brand new story  
Set it alight, we're head over heels in love  
Head over heels  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while  
  
It's the definite show  
Our shadows resting in the moonlight  
It's so clear and bright in your eyes  
It's the touch of your sighs  
My lips are resting on your shoulder  
When we're moving so soft and slow  
We need the ecstasy, the jealousy,  
The comedy of love  
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before  
Give me more tragedy, more harmony  
And fantasy, my dear  
And set it alight, just starting that satellite  
Set it alight  
  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while


This day's an invitation  
And it's just for you  
You've got a reservation  
For the 17th of June  
  
Open your eyes  
And let the sun break in for a while  
There may be something  
That you've never seen inside  
  
Feel how your heart beats  
Like a heavy machine  
The sound of the traffic  
Is like a silent dream  
  
The dust in the park  
The exhaust from the cars  
Ascends in that heated afternoon  
(You touch a sweaty body!)  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The day feels so tired  
From the lead in the air  
And the fire in the skies  
  
Life seemed to be a fault of grace  
But it's ok  
It gave you a kiss  
In the middle of the crossroads  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The heat of the sun  
Which is stored in the pavement  
Feels so fine  
  
Here stands the innocent  
And there it comes oh so wild  
That's when you're longing  
For a summer by the wall  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
Summer in Berlin, it's ok


(.. Dahinter schimmern die sterne)  
May I introduce myself  
I'm your poison  
I'm gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly, you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den  
I hang out here every nite  
I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting for you  
You gonna like what i..., you gonna like it  
You gonna like what I do  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den...  
May I introduce myself  
I'm your poison, I'm gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly, you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den...  
It offers you comfort  
As everything about it  
It is mild, without reason  
And for all it is perfect  
And it is there, where I go now  
And it is there, where I now go  
And it is there, where I now go  
It is there... Where i... Now... Go..


(Gold-Lloyd-Echolette)  
  
This is a national anthem  
From the flip-side of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards  
Hey, tell me it's true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?  
Hey, what do we know,  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Everybody walks this side of the run-way  
Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up...


Into the night  
Still falls the rain  
Even the dogs stay home tonight  
Out on the streets  
Going nowhere  
Just one direction in my thoughts  
Love can be magic  
It can be a game  
Sometimes it's tragic  
And sometimes a shame  
Words were my bullets  
Emotion my gun  
I was a runner  
Now I'm on the run  
Sometimes I wish that you were dead  
That is because you haunt me so  
I wasn't right to let you go away  
I try to kill the pain inside  
But you are always on my mind  
No matter where I go or stay  
Sometimes I dream my time away  
And we're together again  
But I know that can never be  
And all my hopes are in vain  
You were my treasure  
That I didn't know  
You were the sun in my life  
Thought I was dying  
When I realized  
There's just one chance to survive.


On the first part of the journey  
I was looking at all the life  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz  
And the sky with no clouds  
The heat was hot and the ground was dry  
But the air was full of sound  
  
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After two days in the desert sun  
My skin began to turn red  
After three days in the desert fun  
I was looking at a river bed  
And the story it told of a river that flowed  
Made me sad to think it was dead  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After nine days I let the horse run free  
Cause the desert had turned to sea  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground  
And a perfect disguise above  
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground  
But the humans will give no love  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la


Eyes  
Holdin' back the tears  
That they've held for years  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to make you cry  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  
Days  
Where'd you go so fast  
Fin'lly lost at last  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to let you down  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to let you down  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  


It's late at night, I'm all alone  
I call you up, hear your voice on the phone  
Say that you're mine, tell me it's true  
Say that my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know  
  
Here I am, part of the crowd  
Need you so bad, I'm dreamin' out loud  
Say that you're mine, tell me it's true  
Say that my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know  
  
It's late at night, and I'm all alone  
So I call you up, to hear your voice on the phone  
Sayin' your mine, sayin' it's true  
Please say my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know


Written by dan peek, (C)1976  
Found on hideaway and highway.  
  
Alone, sitting here on my own  
There's no place I'd rather be  
Or so it seems  
  
Home, miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see?  
  
You hold your life in your hands  
And no one takes from a man  
Who gives the best that he can  
To make someone understand  
  
I've flown miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see?  
  
You hold your life in your hands  
And no one takes from a man  
Who gives the best that he can  
To make someone understand  
  
Home, miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?


When you feel down and you've nobody to turn to  
When you feel you're about to give up  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
And it's runnin' dry in your lovin' cup  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
You can't ignore the feeling inside you  
In your mind you're without a friend  
The spirit is there, it's in every doorway  
You say to yourself, will it ever end  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
When you feel down and have nobody to turn to  
You say to yourself, why can't it be  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
You feel you want to be free  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit ...


Well, I'm drivin' onward  
Through the pourin' rain  
There's a ticket waitin'  
I gotta catch that train  
The yellow racin' dreamboat  
On California air  
Single engine cowboy  
Out in county fair  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
The silver clouds in August  
Lover's names on trees  
Imagine running water  
You wadin' in knee deep  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
There's a world waitin'  
Just for you to unfold  
How are you to know  
If you don't see, if you don't see  
Those yellow racin' dreamboats  
On California air  
There's a ticket waitin'  
I guess I'll catch you there  
I guess I'll catch you there  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come)  


Sat here thinking about my heart  
All of the places it came apart  
There's just one thing that I need to know  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uh huh  
I ran through the meadow looking for a dream  
Truth is never like what it seems  
I guess there's always so far to go  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Where is the light  
Where is the love  
Where are the dreams that I once had  
Frittered away  
Gone in the time it takes to get from there to here  
Get it get it get it  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
I'd draw you a picture cause it just might help  
To point out the place where we went so wrong  
The only color I'd use is blue  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  


The boy cried out  
Gaily on the ground  
At the joy  
Of something he had found  
  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
  
The days are getting warmer now  
The nights are getting shorter now  
And you know we can make it 'cause you know we're alive  
But we don't have to take it, any way we'll survive  
  
If I were you  
I'd throw it far away  
But if you were me  
You'd tell me I should stay  
  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together again  
  
Again, again and again and again  
Again, and again and again  
Again, again, again


Oh, look out kids it's that time of year  
When ole Santa's on his way  
Don't look now but the top is down  
On his candy apple sleigh  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in his hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California, wo-oh  
  
The boulevard, lights of red and green  
As the snow birds make the scene  
Hollywood doesn't miss a beat  
It's another childhood dream  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time for sure  
In California  
  
People say it can't be true  
That the spirit lives here, too  
But you'll find Christmas everywhere  
Under palm trees, sun and moon - ah  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
In California  
In California, wo-oh


I was out last night having a ball  
And comin' home, I wasn't thinkin' nothin' at all  
And there on the sidewalk what did I see  
A little glass slipper starin' back at me  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
Well I'm not superstitious but I'm smarter than I seem  
And I knew it was love, if you know what I mean  
When I saw that slipper it occurred to me  
The shoe fit her and she fit me  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
When I find her it will be  
A fairy tale for her and me  
I will never let her go  
Cinderella  
  
Now the other girls hold no fascination for me  
I just think of her wherever she may be  
I will search my whole life through  
'Cause no one else will ever do  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
When I find her it will be  
A fairy tale for her and me  
I will never let her go  
She will give my heart a home  
Until that day I'll be alone  
With just a slipper and a dream  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Oo (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)


Clarice lay down your mind, it's there just hard to find  
Follow me as we wind our way, away  
  
Behind an open door there lies a million more  
Follow me as we wind our way, away  
  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon, time is coming soon  
  
Behind an open door there lies a million more  
Follow me as we wind our way, away  
  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon, time is coming soon


Ah  
Lately, it hasn't been easy  
I've been wanderin' all night  
Searchin', tryin' to find an answer  
Why I'm in this situation  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Trying to keep my head above water  
Close to the wind, without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Everyday it just gets harder  
But you're all I need to survive  
For so long it felt like  
I was walking on the water  
I found the hard part  
Is waking without you in the morning  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
The weight of the world's on my shoulders (everyday now)  
Close to the wind, without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
The loneliness it's neverending (yes I'm falling)  
Open your heart, come aboard  
And if we're back together  
I know our love will be everlasting  
I still believe that there's a chance  
For us to have a happy ending  
Peace will reign on earth  
LIfe for all it's worth, oh yeah  
I pray every single morning  
That this time we will be much stronger  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Help me try to find a shelter (to protect you)  
Close to the wind without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
But inside it's safe and warm now (we're together)  
Don't be afraid of the storm  
I've been sailing close, close to the wind (been sailing in)  
(Close to the wind) Don't be afraid of the storm  
I've been sailing close, close to the wind (been sailing in)  
(Close to the wind) Don't be afraid of the storm ...  


Some can see it's poetry  
Come as you are in your broken car  
The company  
Carousel is wishing well  
As a wonder night that spoke delight  
To the company  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Broken dream, just a token scheme  
Silver man with a telegram  
For the company  
Scalding blue, come talk to you  
Search the cave for the grave  
Of the company  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  


Secret calls long after hours  
Suspicions rise, why does she whisper  
Someone's hiding something  
What's going on  
She smiles and finds an excuse to go out  
Meets him somewhere on the edge of town  
For one more night of real love  
How can it be wrong  
'Cause when they turn out the lights  
In their rented room tonight  
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
A cheater's conscience has no pride  
To spend the night with another man's wife  
Lie to his best friend and never think twice  
He knows where to find what he longs to have  
And do anything 'cause he wants her that bad  
Love has many faces, faces to hide  
'Cause when they turn out the lights  
In their rented room tonight  
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love (desperate love), risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love (desperate love), risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight ...  


Starlight falling through your hair  
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there  
Awake in the morning a smile on your face  
The same old feeling that I just can't place  
And you say don't cry, baby  
You know I'll always be the one who cares  
Don't cry, baby  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
A man came in with a violin  
He played for me like I've never been  
Courted before and forevermore  
As the bow touched the strings  
He made the whole world sing  
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
You know there'll always be someone who cares  
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
I know I've been wrong  
You've had to be strong  
I guess I belong to you, my baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
You know I'll always be the one who cares  
Don't cry baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
The sound of your voice singing songs in the night  
Have taken me far away and mystified  
The songs of the lovers brought tears to my eyes  
The words that you'd spoken made me realize  


Written by dewey bunnell, (C)1976  
Found on hideaway.  
Somebody told me that the time was right  
To keep on ridin' and to hang on tight  
I heard the cry of a dog in the night  
But nobody told me it would be all right  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took a ride down a hill that night  
The man was crazy but he wouldn't fight  
With bullets in his back and money in a sack  
We robbed a bank and we never looked back  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night, alright  
Don't let it get you down  
'cause nobody made a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
They'll be lucky if we're ever found  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down) ...  


The waves come in  
Crash on the shoreline  
Salty water, don't you know  
It's yours, yours and mine  
So grab your girl  
And don't go wastin' time  
And let's go down to the water tonight  
  
White capped clouds  
Dance in the sunlight  
Purple fishes watch  
And show you some of their delight  
The weather's fine  
And everything's all right  
So let's go down to the water tonight  
Let's go down to the water tonight  
  
Come on down, come on down  
Come on down, down to the water  
Come on down, come on down  
Come on down, down to the water  
Down to the water  
  
Island music  
Sways with a palm tree  
Friends of mine lay back  
And talk of times that weren't so free  
So let's have fun  
And that means you and me  
And let's go down to the water tonight  
Let's go down to the water tonight  
  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water...


I stayed up all night long  
Drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout you  
Is there anything left at all  
Is there anything that I can do  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
I don't know how to even the score with you, with you  
Starin' hard at that big front door  
Is it time now to find my shoes  
It ain't the loss of love no more  
I'm just tryin' hard to live with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, with you  
With you, with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Is love a question, who's weak, who's strong  
I can't see it, where's a compromise  
It's so confusin' where this thing has gone  
It's gotta stop, you've gotta realize  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  
I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  


You let me follow you around  
It helped your status in the town  
Well I didn't know your name  
There's no truth in what you claim  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
I think it's called a lesson learned  
When one so close suddenly turns  
Leaves you standing on your own  
Got no place to call your home  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Now it's my time to make amends  
Hope my message don't offend  
And I hope this doesn't drive you round the bend  
Leaves you standing on your own  
Got no place to call your home  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
(Repeat and fade)  


I look inside at the scarlet room  
Places to hide in the dusty gloom  
A noisy clock and a silver spoon  
A china cup on the mantlepiece  
Gathering dust as it did in the east  
And just outside lies the garden of peace  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in this garden has come true  
A mirror pond reflects the dawn  
Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn  
A breeze has come and I'm carried along  
So follow the path through the knowing trees  
And each time you laugh, it is love you release  
That love will come back in the garden of peace  
So, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true ...  


Bells ring in in my ear  
Voices I hear  
Whispering daily to me  
Love in your fire  
High on a wire  
When I know you're near me  
God, I'm glad to see you  
I thought you'd left me far away  
I wouldn't give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
All over the world  
Flags are being unfurled  
Waving before the dawning  
I'm watching the show  
The last one to know  
Which way that things are going  
God, I'm glad to know you  
I thought you'd left me far away  
I wouldn't give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
Cars fighting their way  
Out of L.A.  
On a Sunday morning  
I'm watching the show  
The last one to know  
Which way that things are going  
God, I'm glad to see you  
I thought you'd left me far away  
I wouldn't give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
God, I'm glad to know you  


God of the sun  
Don't make me wait till the morning comes  
Light in the sky  
Look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye  
  
Don't, keep me waiting around  
Too much longer now  
Don't, don't keep me waiting around, around, around, around  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
Saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if you'll ever make it home  
  
God of the sun  
I'll be around till the day's begun  
One sight of your ray  
Takes the night away, away, away, away  
  
Oh, but when I walk through that door  
Take my hat and my coat off waiting for you to call  
I tell you not right now, lady, I got work on my mind  
And I'll talk to you soon  
Always remember  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
I saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if we'll ever make it home  
No more


Watchin' a stretch of road  
Miles of light explode  
Driftin' off a thing  
I'd never done before  
  
Watchin' the crowd roll in  
Out go the lights, it begins  
A feelin' in my bones  
I never felt before  
  
People always told me  
That bars are dark and lonely  
And talk is often cheap  
And filled with air  
  
Sure sometimes they thrill me  
But nothin' could ever chill me  
Like the way they make  
The time just disappear  
  
Feelin' you here again  
Hot on my skin again  
Feelin' good, a thing  
I'd never known before  
  
What does it mean to feel  
Millions of dreams come real?  
A feelin' in my soul  
I'd never felt before  
  
And you, you always told me  
No matter how long it holds me  
If it falls apart  
Or makes us millionaires  
  
You'll be right here forever  
We'll go through this thing together  
And on Heaven's golden shore  
We'll lay our heads


Goodbye, Mrs. Sorrow  
Hope you're feeling better tomorrow night  
Don't put up a fight  
It'll do you no good  
Hello, Uncle Freedom  
I've seen them down on their knees for you  
Nothing they wouldn't do  
To have you along  
I got too many problems  
They just don't understand  
They think their every wish  
Is my command  
Oh no, Sister Susie  
You're in a win or lose affair  
Wish I could be there  
To help you along  
Oh yes, Brother Michael  
We all have every faith in you  
And everything you do  
All the way round  
I got too many problems  
They just don't understand  
They think their every wish  
Is my command  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  


In this world of lost horizons  
Where your dreams burn fast  
But your nights go slower  
Ever find that you're compromising  
All your hopes and fears  
Just to get to know her  
  
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
It's a long long road  
Ever take a stroll down the goodbye highway  
The some other time way  
Try to ease your load  
  
She was never one for social graces  
And hangin' out with the midnight faces  
Wore me out  
I guess the thoughts of the nights alone  
Or the time waiting for the telephone  
Removed the doubt  
  
So we took a ride down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
It's the longest road  
Soon you're fighting over the yours or my way  
The do or die way's  
The only way you know  
  
So you stand up for the things that you're losing  
Out on but it's all so confusing  
You hold on but it slips right through your hands  
Guess it's so long with a change of direction  
Goodbye gotta make my connection  
Solo, as you head on out the door, forever more  
  
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
It's a one way road  
Ever find yourself down the goodbye highway  
The some other time way  
Nowhere left to go, nowhere left to go


Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here were are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now  
  
Here were are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now


I am thinkin' 'bout the days  
We led ourselves astray  
In more than many ways  
Here, within the time we've spent  
Wonderin' what we meant  
By livin' all those years  
By livin' all those years  
  
We are here with nothing to do today  
It's something we can't explain  
And tomorrow, where will we be tomorrow?  
What will we see today?  
  
I am thinkin' 'bout the days  
We led ourselves astray  
In more than many ways  
(Here) Here, within the time we've spent  
Wonderin' what we meant  
By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here, here, here)


Now I'm high in the city  
Feel the evening air  
The crowds in the city  
Compete for a share  
It's all so busy, a complete affair  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way out to daylight  
One drinking orange vodka  
Someone inside here  
Will give us a ride dear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight  
Do or die in the misty city  
All night long  
A nightclub in the middle  
Tappin' time to my song  
Catch hell for leavin'  
They are always wrong  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way in the night-light  
Two people sit and argue  
Someone inside here  
Will give them a ride clear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight  


There's a clock timing the world as it turns  
There's a man marking the candle as it burns  
Keeping track of every minute that remains  
Still we hope somehow  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna turn out fine  
There's a light shining beyond the southern cross  
Burning bright for everyone of us who's lost  
More than faith more than a reason to go on  
Rise on up knowing  
You're gonna win the fight  
It's gonna turn out fine  
You gotta hope it'll be alright  
Come on and hope it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope it'll be alright, please  
When the night turns to the deepest shade of black  
At that point there is no reason to turn back  
High above angels are falling from the sky  
Lift your heart knowing  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna turn out fine  
You gotta hope it'll be alright  
Come on and hope it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope, ya gonna win the fight  
Come on 'n hope with all your might  
Yeah hope it's gonna be alright, please  
Millions of people alone in the dark  
Awaiting a moment of hope  
Please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) it'll be alright  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) you're gonna win the fight  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) with all your might  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it's gonna be alright, please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) it'll be alright  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope, you're gonna win the fight  


All you brothers and sisters  
Lookin' for a better way  
Why don't you all go to the country  
Hitch a ride from the city  
Get away for the day  
The summertime is gonna take you  
People playing music won't forsake you  
But when it's hot  
You gotta go all the way  
All you dancers and twisters  
Lookin' for a place to play  
Why don't you all go to the country  
People in the city  
Get away for the day  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it  
But someone else will push me to it  
But when it's hot  
You gotta go all the way  
The summertime is gonna take you  
People playing music won't forsake you  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it  
But someone else will push me to it  


In the sea the fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night on wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars sail serenely by  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Go, go and ask the magpie  
Where do unicorns go  
  
In the trees the birds have learned to speak  
Gaily colored they keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds playing hide and seek  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Does myth and mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go


Hey, Jesus hey it's me  
Now I've gone international  
And become very rational  
As you decree  
  
Hey, Jesus it's our day  
Now I can bring them home to you  
Though I may loose out on a few  
Who care to stray  
  
We'll make them see international  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
Hey, Jesus it's ok  
Now we have common interests  
And we can help along the rest  
To be like we  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
Hey, Jesus you'll agree  
They're going downhill very fast  
And it don't look as though they'll last  
Till judgement day  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
International, international, international, international  
International, international, international, international


Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that it's right  
Like a thief in the night  
Ah, oh yeah  
I'll tell you it's true  
You come around with your stories to tell  
I don't hold no interest  
But I let you go  
I know you've fallen under his spell  
Don't let him kill you  
He'll only fill you with lies  
You're a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But it's all over  
You're through  
Jet Boy Blue  
He'll only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop, stop while you're still ahead  
You've got a lot to learn  
You're still so young  
Listen to what your mama said  
  
Try to tell you go to hell  
You're just a kid  
Don't take no advice, you never think twice  
Close the door  
Jump in, don't mention what you did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But it's all over  
You're through  
Jet Boy Blue  
He'll only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that it's right  
Like a thief in the night  
  
Woah, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet Boy Blue  
Jet Boy Blue [Repeat: x7]


Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow  
Oh, fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  


You have one letter left to send  
With no beginning and no end  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark, oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
There is no sunshine in your eyes  
You make no sound and yet you cry  
It's not the double cross  
You feel the love you lost, oh no  
This letter has to say goodbye  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark, oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free


This is for all the lonely people  
Thinking that life has passed them by  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
And ride that highway in the sky  
  
This is for all the single people  
Thinking that life has left them dry  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
You never know until you try  
  
Well, I'm on my way  
Yes, I'm back to stay  
Well, I'm on my way back home  
  
This is for all the lonely people  
Thinking that life has passed them by  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
She'll never take you down or  
Never give you up  
You'll never know until you try


Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But it's lost that old surprise  
Time comes and goes so quiet now  
Leaves emptiness behind our eyes  
Oh, darling, if I could spare us  
From an hour of the pain  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Winter's here, bring the blankets out  
To cover up the cold  
I'm dreamin' of the good night's sleep  
Like I used to know in days of old  
You told me you felt all alone  
But you did not tell me when  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Oh, maybe I can't see what's plainly in my view  
Oh, I wish I was a better man, maybe it's just you  
But there's something goin' on here  
Like a wound that will not mend  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again ...  


Through the darkness I see you again  
Watch my temperature rise  
Can't believe my eyes, don't tell me  
I've had way too much tonight  
  
Drank the potion stronger than me  
Got me all confused  
Why you so amused, don't tell me  
You've had way too much tonight  
  
Please don't tell me no  
God, I miss you so  
One thing you should know  
God, I love you so, oh  
  
Had way too much tonight  
I'm a mad dog at times like these  
Don't know where to turn  
Ain't the time to learn my lesson  
I've had way too much tonight  
  
Ain't the time to learn my lesson  
I've had way too much to-  
Really too much to-  
I've had way too much tonight  
Alright  
  
I've had way too much to-  
Really too much to-  
I've had way too much tonight


The moon begins to rise upon my fallen eyes  
I'm taken back to firelight  
A drunken dreamer's plan to stay just as I am  
Amidst the dancing paradise  
A case of beer, a smile, a motorcycle child  
I feel the glow surround me  
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you  
  
Orange funnels and snowy tunnels  
Summer troubles and books in bundles  
Orange funnels and snowy tunnels  
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you


Here in the dawn  
As I walk through this dream  
As I have done since ages now gone  
Shall I read you the letter  
They sent postmarked from somewhere out here  
It's in Latin, I think, I don't know  
Can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Near to their bed (they never sleep)  
They sit sipping their tea, watch the sea  
Move the sand through their heads (sit in their chairs by the bay)  
Did I show you the marks on the wall  
Left by captains now dead (house out on the cove)  
They fell fighting for peace in their lives  
Or so it is said (still nobody seems to be here)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
You can't miss it  
A blue forest on a green sky  
You must risk it  
Don't ignore us if you want us to  
If we want us to survive  
Where will I be (can't you help me to find my way)  
After watching them walking the pier  
At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)  
They're in love with the news  
And don't show if they're living in fear (still nobody seems to be here)  
They eat ice cream alone  
Watch the waves at the end of the pier (ah, nobody seems to hear)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  


Written by russ ballard, (C)1983  
Found on your move and the very best of america.  
  
I've been in love, girl, so many times before  
They'd love me and leave me, i thought i knew the score  
I'd fall in love no more  
I was walking in shadows then, my life a lonely road  
I was walking to nowhere, with a heavy loaded heart  
To laugh i played the part  
  
(do, do, do ... ) then came that magic day  
I saw you as you walked my way  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
The longer together then, the more we fell in love  
No makin' or breakin' up, now i know i found real love  
And i can't get enough (oo, i love you, i really love you)  
So good to be winnin' now, i never thought i'd do  
You got me spinnin', honey it's all down to you  
You're there to see me through (oo, i love you, i really love you, yes i love
you)  
  
(do, do, do ... ) and from just one kiss  
Who would believe that it would be like this  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
My kinda woman i know that this is really love  
There'll be no breakin' up, oh no  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are)  
Oh, yes you are


Got you by my side,  
I'll never be lonely.  
Got you by my side,  
I'll never be afraid.  
Never be lonely anymore.  
Turn away the fools from my door.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Spent a lot of time,  
Waitin' to find you.  
Spent a lot of time,  
All on my own.  
Could've gone a thousand different ways,  
Watching my nights turn to days.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Here in the middle of now or never,  
Finally found where I belong.  
I could go on like this forever,  
Looking at you, looking at you.  
  
Wasn't I the one,  
Love never came to?  
Wasn't I the one,  
So misunderstood?  
All because my heart wasn't sure.  
Never felt a love like this before.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Here in the middle of now or never,  
Finally found where I belong.  
I could go on like this forever,  
Looking at you, looking at you.  
  
Got me by your side,  
Never be lonely.  
Got me by your side,  
Never be afraid.  
And I will not let you down.  
Keeping both feet on the ground.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.


I never found the time  
To see things quite through  
I never found the time  
To give them to you  
  
If living don't come easy  
Don't stop your own voice  
Cause the worst part of living  
Is havin' no choice  
  
Tell me a story  
Tell it with your eyes  
I'm gonna stop believin'  
If I hear another lie  
Drink some cold water  
Your mouth's getting dry  
  
If I only had the time  
To see things right through  
I'd give up all my treasures  
And send them to you  
  
Then livin' would seem easy  
No lights and no noise  
Just me and my lady  
And the echo of her voice  
  
Tell me a story  
Tell it with your eyes  
I'm gonna stop believin'  
If I hear another lie  
Drink some cold water  
Your mouth's getting dry  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories don't die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories don't die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories don't die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time


We were dancin' in the middle  
We could hardly hold our heads up  
I think we had too much to drink  
I remember wondering what they'd think  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
We were thinkin' 'bout the future  
We were trying not to laugh  
Then you made me cry instead  
I remember wishing I was dead  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Well I'm coming home lady  
I'm your homecoming man  
Trying hard to stand the rain  
Gettin' back on my feet again  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  


Hey, honey, won't you sit down  
And stop here for a spell  
Singin' the sweet old lullabies  
To forget about your health  
Don't think about tomorrow  
It's a whole night's sleep away  
Sure would be pleased to have you stay  
And it's reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round tends to take away your smile  
'Pears to me it's all a body can do to stay in tune  
And you've been strainin' at those strings  
From mornin' till noon  
So come on down and hang around  
It'll put you right real soon  
'Cause nothing's changed  
It's all the same  
Reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round can take away your smile  
Reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round can take away your smile  


Lala Salama  
To the Masai Mara  
And asante sana  
Kichwa Tembo  
I'm going Oloololo  
Back to the world where I'm from  
Soon I'll be flying solo  
On a heading that follows the sun  
Oloololo, Oloololo, 'loololo  
'Cause I've been down from Nairobi  
Southeast of Kisumu  
To the waiting savanna  
Like a place that I once knew  
And the river was flowing  
While the crocodile baked in the sun  
With the elephant knowing  
That a change had already begun  
Oloololo, Oloololo, 'loololo  
Oloololo, Oloololo  
(Lala Salama) Oloololo (To the Masai Mara)  
(And asante sana) Oloololo (To Kichwa Tembo)  
  


One morning when the mist came down  
I woke up early and I looked around  
My baby slept, the sky was blue  
I started walkin' thinkin' only of you  
Up the hill and down the road  
Past the people that I barely know  
Round the bend to the run-off wash  
I found a feather that a quail had lost  
Where are you goin' now my friend  
Where are you goin' now  
Are you going to see them on the mountain now  
Goin' to see them trees  
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow  
Goin' to help agree  
To be  
Today  
Some people like to play out loud  
I like them always, they're a laughing crowd  
To catch the wind then come slidin' down  
You reach the bottom fallin' upside down  
Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles  
Brushin' every curl back again  
To those sunset walks  
That special summer and those all night talks  


Give me all your money, any time I ask  
Desperate situation, rally to the task  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God  
Warm you till you can sleep at night  
  
Somewhere in your memory  
Lies the dormant seed  
Pacify your guilt now, and satisfy my greed  
Playing God, climb the golden ladder  
Playing God  
Warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
  
Between the ether and the opium lies the land of no regret  
Of what we are and what we might become  
Are we walking on the water yet?  
  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God, warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
Playing God, climb the golden ladder  
Playing God  
  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God, warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
Playing God


I can't help thinkin' as those ships sail away  
What sirens beckon and call  
How long at sea this time how long between  
The ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge they move to far off lands  
Maybe Australia or North African sands  
Complete the mission, supply and demand  
To ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
When they'll be casting off anchor as they sail away  
Into the morning light  
Rising and falling through the blue and gray  
To ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
I'll take the chance this time to change my world (change my world)  
And break those ties that bind (ties that bind)  
Far from those people passing through my life  
Like ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge I'll move to far off lands (far off lands)  
Maybe Australia or North African sands (North African sands)  
Complete my mission, hope you understand  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call ...  


Living on the riverside taking it all in my stride  
Living on the riverside, I'm taking life like a big long ride  
You stay on your side and I'll stay on mine  
You take what you want and I'll take the sunshine  
  
Dit dit dit dit do  
Ah, ah  
  
I said the world don't owe me no living  
I said the world don't owe me no living  
I said the world don't owe me no living  
I said the world don't owe me no living


One more song about movin' along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
(Ah -- --)  
  
Filled the room with flowers from Norway  
Sensed her majesty in the air  
Made a sign 'bove your doorway, to show I care  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been standing on your corner  
(Don't go away) Don't go away  
  
One more song about movin' along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
I've been waiting every morning ...


First came the winter  
And then came the morning  
Bright coral branches that pass you again  
Down from the meadow and onto the seashore  
Came the vast checkerboard kingdom of men  
Sun radiates gold infrarays  
Time to prepare for the fall  
Harvest the corn, watch for the storm  
Soon we will hear winter call  
Ice on the pond, won't stay too long  
Too thin to walk it today  
Ice on the pond, something went wrong  
Frost must be lost on the way  
Evening is falling  
The tree is a silhouette  
As seen by the teddy bear  
Watching his den  
Spring came so quickly  
That I did not see her  
Just turn around  
And she's coming again  
Wind chimes along, rising at dawn  
Seasons in circles too match  
Each comes along, singing his song  
Burying thoughts of the past  


Caroline is falling in and out of love  
Try'n' to get those things that she's been thinkin' of  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Caroline is calling everyone in town  
First she calls them friends and then she puts them down  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Wo, she's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  


We're afraid she's gonna let you down  
Take your money and drop you to the ground  
Wouldn't want to see you messed around  
After all the love you think you've found  
She's gonna let you down  
  
Doesn't matter what we say  
Love's the stubbornest game to play  
Given time you might see it our way  
And we'll be sorry boy until that day  
She's gonna break away  
  
Remember all the times you helped us through  
Now here's our chance to do the same for you  
Guess the thing to do is wait around  
Lend a hand when you are on the ground  
She's gonna let you down  
She's gonna let you down  
She's gonna let you down


Life today is frittered away  
You've got to simplify  
Each in our own way, we live for today  
And never know why  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
  
Take your cars and your bars  
And trade 'em all in for a nice wood fire  
At the end of the day I know you will say  
You couldn't get much higher  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
You know I'd like to make it mine


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, yoo-hoo  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand, just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs, we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop  
  
There's a happy feeling, nothing in the world can buy  
When you pass around the cider and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, yoo-hoo  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand, just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
For a sleigh ride together with you, sleigh ride together with you  
Sleigh ride together with you


I hear you knockin' but you can't come in  
You wear your stockings like you think it's a sin  
Don't try to tell me you ain't been where you been  
'Cause I know that you've been messin' round with him  
So slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Come on down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Oh down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
I met you dancin' at the high school gym  
You rubbed against me my head started to spin  
You turned around gave me a wink and a grin  
And then you told me that you'd like to be friends  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
Take it!  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't try to tell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
You'll never sell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
I said before it gets too late  
You know before it gets too late  
Oh, hey  


Sometimes there are teardrops across your face  
Sometimes there are rainbows in the same place  
And I don't know which way to turn  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
I know sometimes we act just the same  
Your heart's in the city, it wears me down  
No love, no pity, in this town  
And I don't know which way to turn  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
I know baby  
Hold on tight to me mama  
Tell me what went wrong  
I'm alright I will lay beside you  
Till the night is gone  
Ah, oo ...  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
Sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  


Why do you laugh at me when you know I really care  
You sometimes act as though I'm not even there  
And yet if you did to me the things I do to you  
I would surely say we're through  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you know that I love you  
I was hoping you'd love me, too  
Don't you know that I love you, love you  
  
If I seem to you indifferent once or twice  
It's because I was feelin' quite that way  
And the time I hung up the phone and didn't speak again  
Well, it's funny to look back then  
  
Didn't I love you (Love you)  
Didn't I love you all the time  
Didn't you need me (Need me)  
Wasn't it a long, hard climb  
  
[Chorus]


Well, I'm running down the road  
Tryin' to loosen my load  
I've got seven women on  
My mind,  
Four that wanna own me,  
Two that wanna stone me,  
One says she's a friend of mine  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels  
Drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Don't even try to understand  
Just find a place to make your stand  
And take it easy  
Well, I'm a standing on a corner  
In winslow, arizona  
And such a fine sight to see  
It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed  
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me  
Come on, baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win though  
We will never be here again  
So open up, I'm climbin' in,  
So take it easy  
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen  
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my  
Cover, she's so hard to find  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own  
Wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me, oh oh oh  
Oh we got it easy  
We oughta take it easy


You must be lost in a faraway land  
I searched forever your footprints in the sand  
I feel you need me, I have to answer  
That desperate call that I do not understand  
  
A burning bridge, a lonely highway  
Another dark night thinking alone  
What could've happened, am I just dreaming  
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
So on and on I keep on running  
To make the border before the light  
Just one more river, then I can make it  
Again you'll be in my arms tonight  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border ...


These brown eyes of mine  
They've been doin' some powerful cryin'  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Winter's come and gone  
And I've been left alone  
Now I'm here home with you (I'm here home with you)  
I do all the things that you do  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh, baby, I know you're right  
  
Seems like a long, long time  
Since I've held you in these arms of mine  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years (Thinkin' 'bout all those years)  
That always bring back the tears  
  
The winter's come and gone  
And I've been left all alone  
But, oh, baby, I know you're right  
  
And now that you're far away  
I think of your love  
And I'm praying that you're still mine  
  
These brown eyes of mine  
They've been doin' some powerful cryin'  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years (Thinkin' 'bout all those years)  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh, baby, I know you're right  
Baby, I know you're right  
Baby, I know you're right


Hold me close  
You turn nighttime into day  
And you're the most  
Brightest star that lights my way  
  
[Chorus]  
So come home to me now  
Cause it won't matter anyhow  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day  
  
Turn me out  
Turn me out on this fine day  
'Cause all about  
All the people like to play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day  
  
Hold me close  
You turn nighttime into day  
And you're the most  
Brightest star that lights my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day [Repeat: x3]


Touched by a butterfly on my way home  
Flying who knows where  
Walking down that dusty road  
Without a care  
The sun was shining up in the country  
And bells were ringing downtown  
Clouds were moving slow and lazy  
While I was kicking around  
And feeling out the town and the country  
Feeling out the town and the country  
Up on the hill I got a better look  
I watched the river run brown (watched the river run brown)  
And then I heard those songbirds singing  
The country sound  
When I got home I sat in my kitchen  
And turned the television on (turned the TV on)  
The news wasn't good so I didn't listen  
I started clicking around  
Thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country  
Thinking of the town and the country  
In the morning everything will be the same  
Open up your world (watch the children play)  
In the sun or rain  
Thinking of the town and the country  
A thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country (fade)  


Well, she said all along, I'm her one  
A little fingernail polish, chewin' gum  
Her round the world heart made of platinum, that's right  
She looks like a China doll baby, especially in white  
A tropicana flower in the candlelight  
She turned into a pumpkin pie, sweet kiss at midnight  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She wants to be your red-hot mama, all alone  
She dances with the boys on the telephone  
She makes a lotta noise in the quiet zone at night  
Yeah, you talk about a party at the beach, ain't that grand  
She just took a raincheck with another man  
Who lay on the deck of his catamaran some night  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
Well, I can't tell you much, but what I know (what I know)  
You can't take her with you when it's time to go  
'Cause she knows where it's at with a Romeo, you'll see  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She moves  
Just like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  


Twinkling lights  
A chill is in the air  
And carols everywhere  
Close your eyes, it's almost here  
Candles and cards  
And favorite movie scenes  
The smell of evergreen  
As special as it's always been  
And I have a dream or two  
Maybe they will come true  
  
[Chorus:]  
Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight  
We'll wake up to a world of white  
It's gonna be a christmas to remember  
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole  
Always sentimental and don't you know that  
It's gonna be a Christmas to remember  
  
I know it's true  
Time doesn't stand still  
Many things can change  
But we know some things never will  
The memories we share  
The songs we always sing  
The mystery of life  
The hopefulness this season brings  
And I have a dream or two  
Maybe they will come true  
  
[Chorus:]


Abide with me, fast falls the eventide  
The darkenss deepens, Lord, with me abide  
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me  
  
I need Thy presence every passing hour  
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
Through cloud and sunshine, o abide with me  
  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me  
  
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, Thy victory?  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me  
  
Abide , with me  
Abide, abide with me  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me


After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be is for you  
After the stillness finds you  
After the winds of change  
All that is good and true between us  
This will remain the same  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
After your time of wondering  
Along this lonely road  
There will be many voices calling  
Mine will say welcome home  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ash is cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
I will be here for you  
  


Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
Listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
Too late for walking in the middle,  
Too late to try.  
And it's too late for sitting in the balance,  
No more middle line.  
  
Are you puzzled by the way that you're behaving?  
You wonder why you do the things you do?  
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance?  
It feels like something's got a hold on you.  
  
Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
When I'm losing my sense of direction,  
And I'm needing some strength and protection,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You, and when I,  
When I think I can't stand any longer,  
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
El-Elyon na Adonai,  
Age to age, You're still the same,  
By the power of the name.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
Erkamka na Adonai,  
I will praise and lift You high,  
El Shaddai.  
  
I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly.  
I'm lighter than air.  
  
And I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly,  
And soar through the air.  
  
'Cause I have felt for the first time,  
I can be myself,  
No more faces to hide behind,  
Just a smile,  
And a dream that's mine.  
Even if I am  
The only one,  
Who wants to fly....  
  
I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl,  
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world.  
But that's all right, as long as I can have one wish I pray:  
When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say,  
  
She's got her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes, ya know.  
Just like my father's eyes.... (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing....  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing!  
You know you really gotta sii-hii-yiing!  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing! (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
I have decided,  
I'm gonna live like I believer,  
Turn my back on the deceiver.  
I'm gonna live what I believe.  
I have decided,  
Being good is just a fable,  
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.  
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing.  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing,  
We've all gotta sii-hii-yiiiiiing!  
Come on, sing, sing, sing!


When the weight of all my dreams  
Is resting heavy on my head  
And the thoughtful words of help and hope  
Have all been nicely said  
But I'm still hurting, wondering if I'll ever be the one  
I think I am--I think I am.  
Then you gently re-remind me  
That You've made me from the first  
And the more I try to be the best  
The more I get the worst.  
And I realize the good in me is only there because of who  
You are, who You are.  
And all I ever have to be is what  
You've made me  
Any more or less would be a step out of Your plan  
As you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind  
That I only have to do what I can find  
And all I ever have to be  
All I have to be  
All I ever have to be is what You've made me  


Baby, baby  
I'm taken with the notion  
To love you with the sweetest of devotion  
  
Baby, baby  
My tender love will flow from  
The bluest sky to the deepest ocean  
  
Stop for a minute  
Baby, I'm so glad you're mine, yeah  
You're mine  
  
Baby, baby  
The stars are shining for you  
And just like me I'm sure that they adore you  
  
Baby, baby  
Go walking through the forest  
The birds above a' singing you a chorus  
  
Stop for a minute  
Baby, they're so glad you're mine, oh yeah  
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion  
Baby I realize that there's just no getting over you  
  
Baby, baby  
In any kind of weather  
I'm here for you always and forever  
  
Baby, baby  
No muscle man could sever  
My love for you is true and it will never  
  
Stop for a minute  
Baby, they're so glad you're mine  
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion  
Baby I realize that there's just no getting over you  
  
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion  
Baby I realize that there's just no getting over you  
Over you  
  
Baby, baby  
Always and forever  
Baby I'm so glad that  
Here for you baby  
So glad you're mine  
Baby I'm so glad that  
When I think about you it makes me smile  
Baby, baby be mine  
Baby I'm so glad that  
Don't stop giving love  
Don't stop, no  
Baby I'm so glad that you're mine  
Baby I'm so glad  
Baby I'm so glad that  
When I think about you it makes me smile


Once my life had no direction, I was lost as could be  
I was caught in a whirlpool, spinning around in misery  
I needed a friend, you took me in and you touched my heart  
With your song of love you gave me a brand new start  
Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringing inside my head  
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love  
You gave me just enough to make me hunger for more of you  
Now I'm hooked on your lovin' and I don't want to break loose  
With my heart in my hand, I'm yours to command, do what you want me to  
Just never let me go, Lord, I'm so in love with you  
Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love  
Beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  
Beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  


Little bits of heaven  
Floating gently by the window  
Soon this dirty city will be  
Covered with a new snow  
  
Let's put on our winter boots  
Go outside and play  
Christmas can't be very far away  
  
Weather girl says "bundle up"  
It's gonna be a cold one  
I'll put on my wooly hat  
You'll wear your dad's old Stetson  
  
Pretty lights are everywhere  
Shining night and day  
Christams can't be very far away  
  
Let's take a walk downtown and  
Go dream shopping in the mall  
The kids can do the Santa thing  
Photographs and all  
  
We'll get the biggest tree this year  
And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more  
Than what we've got  
But so what  
  
Come next spring  
I know we will be  
Ready for the sunshine  
Right now throwin' snowballs  
At each other's such a fun time  
  
Kids will think we're crazy  
For awhile and that's okay  
Christmas can't be very far away  
Christmas can't be very far away


Are you far away from home  
This dark and lonely night  
Tell me what best would help  
To ease your mind  
Someone to give  
Direction for this unfamiliar road  
Or one who says, "Follow me and I  
Will lead you home. "  
  
How beautiful  
How precious  
The Savior of all  
To love so  
Completely  
The loneliest soul  
How gently  
How tenderly  
He says to one and all,  
"Child you can follow Me an  
I will lead you home  
Trust Me and follow Me  
And I will lead you home. "  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus  
I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
In Thy tender care  
And take us to Heaven  
To live with Thee there  
Take us to Heaven  
To live with Thee there


Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?  
Can you look back on the moment after all these years?  
On the moment love broke through and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?  
  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?  
How he gently and tenderely washed away your sin  
Don't you know that He still cares the way He did back then?  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?  
  
Keep holdin' on  
Never letting go  
We're not far  
from the end of the road  
  
Keep holdin' on  
Never letting go  
We're not far  
from the end of the road  
  
In a moment love broke through heaven and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the moment your heart was moved to tears?  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?


Hear me speak what's on my mind  
Let me give this testimony  
Reaffirm that you will find  
That you are my one and only.  
  
No exception to this rule  
I'm simple but I'm no fool  
I've got a witness happy to say  
Every hour, every day.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
My red blood runs true blue  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Classic case of boy meets girl  
Moving in the same direction  
You're not asking for the world  
I'm not asking for perfection.  
  
Just a love that's well designed  
For passing the test of time  
I'm here to tell you  
I'm here to stay  
Every hour, every day.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true  
Every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah  
My red blood runs true blue  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
Yeah sure maybe I'm on the edge  
But I love you baby and like I said  
I'm here to tell you  
I'm here to stay  
Every hour, every day.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true  
Every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name (every)  
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah  
My red blood runs true blue  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name (every)  
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah  
(Every heartbeat)  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true  
Every heartbeat belongs to you.  


Father, blessed Father it's morning again  
I give You Father, myself Father continue Your plan  
I know together we can climb mountains in the sky  
No one can stop us when I'm standing by Your side  
When trouble's knocking here again  
I'll tell him Jesus has me by his hand He'll walk me through  
Father, loving Father create in me  
A pure love, Father, Your love, Father instill it in me  
I remember the nights I've cried for You  
Now I only have to die for You  
Thank You, Lord, You've made it clear just for me  
I see the light it's burning out the night, oh, Father it's morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning  


But there are so many  
Who don't know the reason  
Their lives are wasting away  
Just souls without purpose  
They wonder in darkness  
Without a thought for the day  
Well, I'm no Savior  
I'm just a window  
Through which Your sweet love light can shine  
So clean out the corners of my darkened pane  
And fill me with Your love again  
  
Fill me with Your love again  
Fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again  
  
Fill me with Your love again  
Fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again


I will be walking one day  
Down a street far away  
And see a face in the crowd and smile  
Knowing how you made me laugh  
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past  
I will remember you.  
  
Look in my eyes while you're near  
Tell me what's happening here  
See that I don't want to say good-bye  
Our love is frozen in time  
I'll be your champion and you will be mine  
I will remember  
I will remember you.  
  
Later on  
When this fire is an ember  
Later on  
When the night's not so tender  
Given time  
Though it's hard to remember darlin'  
I will be holding  
I'll still be holding to you  
So many years come and gone  
And yet the memory is strong  
One word we never could learn  
Good-bye  
True love is frozen in time  
I'll be your champion and you'll be mine  
I will remember you  
So please remember  
I will remember you  
I will remember you  
I will remember you  
I will remember you.


When I was a younger  
I used to dream a lot  
Staring into my coffee  
About how you'd love me  
And write me poetry  
And want to be with me, yeah  
Well, momma done told me  
You might wander far, yeah  
But nobody warned me  
The road would own your heart  
  
And so I'm saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
I'll put your records on  
Pretend you're still at home  
  
Now that I'm older  
I sit at home a lot  
With the kid we've got, yeah  
The radio's playing  
He really loves his wife  
I hear the D.J. saying  
Well momma done told me  
You might wander far, oh  
As long as you hold me  
More than you hold that guitar  
  
I'll keep on saying  
If you have to go away  
I'll leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
I'll want to be with you  
I'll be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I won't be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
I'll be loving you  
Till it's cold in hell  
  
Maybe you'll write me this time  
Maybe you'll call on a static line  
Saying don't you ever worry your pretty mind  
Cause you and me are gonna be fine  
  
And so I'm saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
I'll put your records on  
Pretend you're still at home  
  
If you have to go away  
I'll leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
I'll want to be with you  
I'll be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I won't be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
I'll be loving you  
I'll be loving you  
If you have to go away


Day turns to night, and I turn into bed.  
Can't get to sleep, something's in my head.  
Pacing the floor, I try to force a rhyme.  
Why do I fear this time?  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not a song till it touches your heart.  
It's not a song till it tears you apart.  
After what's left of what's right and what's wrong,  
Till it gets through to you,  
It's not a song.  
  
Now close your eyes, look into your hand.  
What do you see?  
Life is our song, to give and learn to take.  
Time will not wait.  
  
Oh, won't you please come dance,  
While the song's still playing,  
Won't be long till the silence falls.  
  
[Chorus: x4]


Consider the lilies of the field  
Solomon dressed in royal robes, has not the worth of them  
Consider the lilies of the field  
He takes after each and every need, leave all your cares behind  
Seek him and you will find Your Father loves you so  
Consider the creatures of the air  
For all of the diamonds in all the earth have not the wealth of them  
Consider the creatures of the air  
Jehovah loves them with tender hand, He knows your every care  
His touch is always there to see you through the night  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
Consider the lilies of the field  
For how much more does He love His own? If Yaweh cares for them  
Consider the creatures of the air  
He takes after each and every need  
If we ask Him for bread, will He give us a stone?  
Jehovah loves His own  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let you go  
And Jehovah I love you so  
And Jesus I want you to know  
All you've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let you go  
Never let you go  
Never go  


Just like tarzan,swinging on a vine.I move hard left then come back right.My
life is like a bommerang flow.It's far away then it's right back home.The
giant pendulum is swinging to and fro.This road were riding on where does it
go?And maybe soon is gone end than you never know.  
  
Chorus  
Hard as I try to get all arranged.Life's gonna change,uhh!Just when i'm used
to the pouring rain.That's when the sun starts shinin again.Life's Gonna
Change!  
  
Why not smile,while you got your smile.The tears might come.Might last a
while.Might as well live,while you got your life ,cause it's a little too late
when it's time to die.The giant pendulum is ticking off the days.I only blink
and may have passed away.And that's why anytime i turn around it's been
amazed.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just When I'm Used To The Pouring Rain.That's when the sun starts shinin
again!Life's Gonna Change!  
  
Instrumental  
Sun is gonna shine on me!  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just when i'm used to the pourin rain.That's when the sun starts shinin
again,Life is gonna change.Repeat Chorus.Sings Life's gonna change till
fade.Repeat Chorus Till Fades.


I love to sing and I love to pray  
Worship the Lord most every day  
I go to the temple and I just want to stay  
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways  
And I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now praising the Father is a good thing to do  
To worship the trinity in spirit and truth  
But if we worshiped all of the time  
There would be no one to lead the blind  
But I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now I am not saying that worship is wrong  
But worship is more than just singin' a song  
It's all that you say and everything that you do  
It's letting his spirit live through you  
Still I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  


Main street U.S.A boarded up and dry  
Knowin' what once was here just makes me want to cry  
Used to be the favorite place  
Now what remains are memories even time cannot erase  
Old man Johnson's store, where we grew up too fast  
All that remains today are echoes from the past  
Used to be a boomin' town  
All that's left is either broken up or broken down  
Singing, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh  
Where we used to belong  
There ain't nobody home  
Said, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh  
You can knock all you want  
But, ain't nobody home  
Packed up, moved away, runnin' from the past  
Leaving behind the dusty dreams and broken glass  
Used to be a busy town  
Now, everybody passes through, but they don't stick around  
  
(Chorus)  
Was a newsstand on the corner  
Right next to the barber shop  
And down the street there  
That's where all the kids would stop  
And they would tease the neighbor's bulldog  
Laugh and run away  
Now, there's no one left who knows the truth in what you say  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Final Chorus)


If you think you're gonna fail  
Well, you're probably gonna fail  
So tell me, what was all the dreaming for?  
And if you think you're gonna lose  
Well, you're probably gonna lose  
So what's the point in trying anymore?  
  
What you're looking for, you'll find  
It happens every time  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
When your fragile heart is breaking  
And your confidence is shaken  
I can tell you that we've all been there before  
The first step is hard to take  
But it's a choice you gotta make  
When life is waiting through that open door  
  
I wish that you could see  
The way you look to me  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
Oh, not so long ago,  
You pulled me through  
  
So I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Even if the rain comes down  
And your sky is falling  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You know we can work this out  
If we just keep talking  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
'Cause is you think you have a chance  
Then you really have a chance  
I hope you know that I believe in you


Where could I go, where could I run  
Even if I found the strength to fly  
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn  
And crashed through the corner of the sky  
If I sailed past the edge of the sea  
Even if I made my bed in Hell  
Still there You would find me  
'Cause nothing is beyond You  
You stand beyond the reach  
Of our vain imaginations  
Our misguided piety  
The heavens stretch to hold You  
And deep cries out to deep  
Singing that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
Time cannot contain You  
You fill eternity  
Sin can never stain You  
Death has lost its sting  
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me  
Except to say that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
If I should shrink back from the light  
So I can sink into the dark  
If I take cover and I close my eyes  
Even then You would see my heart  
And You'd cut through all my pain and rage  
The darkness is not dark to You  
And night's as bright as day  
Nothing is beyond You  
You stand beyond the reach  
Of our vain imaginations  
Our misguided piety  
The heavens stretch to hold You  
And deep cries out to deep  
Singing that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
And time cannot contain You  
You fill eternity  
Sin can never stain You  
And death has lost its sting  
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me  
Except to say that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  


O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of His heaven  
We hear the Christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emmanuel  
  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls will receive Him  
Still the dear Christ enters in.


O love that will not let me go  
I rest my weary soul in thee  
I give thee back the life I owe  
That in thine ocean depths its flow  
My richer, fuller be  
  
O light that followest all my way  
I yield my flickering torch to thee  
My heart restores its borrowed ray  
That in thy sunshines glow its day  
May brighter, fairer be  
  
O joy you seek me through the pain  
I cannot close my heart to thee  
I trace the rainbow through the rain  
And feel the promise is not vain  
Then morn shall tearless be


O Master, let me walk with Thee  
In lowly paths of service free  
Tell me Thy secret, help me hear  
The strain of toil, the fret of care  
  
Teach me Thy patience, still with Thee  
In closer, dearer company  
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong  
In truth that triumphs over wrong  
  
O Master let me walk with Thee  
In closer, dearer company  
O Master let me walk with Thee  
Let me walk with Thee  
  
In hope that sends a shining ray  
Far down the future's broadening way  
In peace that only Thou canst give  
With Thee, O Master, let me live


O sacred head now wounded  
With grief and shame way down,  
Now scornfully surrounded  
With thorns thine only crown,  
  
How art thou pale with anguish,  
With sore abuse and scorn.  
How does that visage languish,  
Which once was bright as morn.  
  
What language shall i borrow  
To thank thee dearest man?  
For this, thy dying sorrow,  
Thy pity without end.  
  
O make me thine forever,  
And should i fainting be,  
Lord, let me never, ever  
Outlive my love to thee.


Are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
Are you walking' with unnecessary burdens  
Are you trying to take them upon yourself  
If you are then you're living in bondage  
And you know that's bad for your spiritual health  
And are you trying to live by your emotions  
Are you puttin' your faith in what you feel and see  
Then you're living just to satisfy your passions  
And you better be careful, 'cause you're being deceived  
Are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
If you are then you're headed for trouble  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die  
Are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
If you are then you're headed for trouble  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die  
Are you puzzled by the way that you're behavin'  
Do you wonder why you do the things you do  
And are you troubled by your lack of resistance  
Do you fell that something's got a hold on you  
Well, deep within' you there's a spiritual battle  
There's a voice of the darkness and the voice of the light  
And just by listening you've made a decision  
'Cause the voice you hear is gonna' win the fight  
Are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
If you are then you're headed for trouble  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die  
If you're living as a new creation  
If you're listening to the Father of light  
Then you're living in a mighty fortress  
And you're gonna' be clothed in power and might  
But are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
If you are then you're headed for trouble  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die  
If you're living as a new creation  
If you're listening to the Father of light  
Then you're living in a mighty fortress  
And you're gonna' be clothed in power and might  
But are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
If you are then you're headed for trouble  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die  
But if you're living as a new creation  
If you're listening to the Father of light  
Then you're living in a mighty fortress  
And you're gonna' be clothed in power and might  


They were the sweetest words I'd ever heard  
My heart could barely take it in  
Like water offered to the lips  
Of a tired and thirsty man  
  
'cause it's a tangled web of woven  
I don't know all the reasons  
But it amazes me to wake up  
To your mercy every morning  
  
So I'm standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And I'm still alive and reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
'cause you say  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Out in the open  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come onout  
Into the light  
There is no jury  
There is no judge  
Ready and waiting  
Are the steady arms of love 124  
  
For the sake of never making waves I  
Kept my secrets to myself  
And no one ever really knew the  
Darker shadows of my heart  
  
But I will be a witness  
That there's nothing in me dark enough  
The power of forgiveness  
Cannot resuce from the deep  
  
So I'm standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And I'm still alive and reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
And you say  
Come on out come out  
Come on out come out  
Out in the open  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Into the light  
There is no jury  
There is no judge  
Ready and waiting  
Are a steady arms of love 240  
  
Hey  
And I'm standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And I'm still alive  
And reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Out in the open  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Into the light  
There is no jury  
There is no judge

We've got our little fingers workin' hard  
On the trains and dolls and cars  
Hurryin' 'cause Santa's a-waitin'  
Soldiers marchin' out the door  
Carryin' the toys galore  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
This is more than just another reindeer ride  
Not a practice run in July  
We've got to load up all the festive gear  
Peace, and hope, and yuletide cheer  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
Polish the runners, shine Rudolph's nose  
Tighten the harness, brush off the snow  
We'd love to sing our little working songs,  
Wish that we could tag along  
Just to see the children's faces  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh.  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh. (It's time to load up the sleigh).  
For Santa's reindeer ride.  
  


(Oh....)  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Tell me that time can't erase  
This look of love on your face.  
  
Let me say once more that I need you,  
One more time or just maybe two.  
Oh, my life will always be richer  
For the time I've spent here with you.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Tell me that time won't erase  
The way that my heart sees your face.  
  
I call your name,  
You look my way,  
It's clear you trust each word I say.  
When life is long and problems come,  
You'll always be my only one.  
So now we're standing face to face,  
And with one look your eyes embrace me.  
Squeeze away each haunting fear,  
And say the words I long to hear.  
  
Tell me that time won't erase  
This look of love.  
  
Oh....  
  
Let me say once more.  
I love you.  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
One more time or just maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I want to know more of you.  
  
(I call your name,  
You look my way, I love you.  
It's clear you trust each word I say. I do....  
When life is long and problems come,  
You'll always be my only one.  
So now we're standing face to face, Oh, I need you.  
And with one look your eyes embrace me. I want you.  
Squeeze away each haunting fear, More and more and more.  
And say the words I long to hear.)  
  
(I call your name, Let me say once more  
You look my way, That I love you,  
It's clear you trust each word I say. Let me say one time, maybe two,

I had laid some mighty plans  
Thought I held them in my hands  
Then my world began to crumble all away I tried to build it back again  
I couldn't bear to see it end  
How I hurt to know You wanted it that way.  
(Chorus)  
And I'm so glad, glad to find the reason  
That I'm happy-sad that  
You've torn it all away  
And I'm so glad, though it hurts to know I'm leaving Everything I ever thought
that I would be  
Once I held it in my hand  
It was a kingdom made of sand  
But now you've blown it all away  
I can't believe that I can say that I'm glad.  
Long before my plans were made I know a master plan was laid  
With a power that superceded my control  
And if that truth could pierce my heart I wouldn't wander from the start
Trying desperately to make it on my own.  
(Chorus)


My stubborn will at last hath yielded  
I would be Thine and Thine alone  
And this the prayer my lips are bringing  
Lord, let in me Thy will be done  
  
[Chorus]  
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
  
I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary  
The darksome path hath dreary grown  
But now a light has ris'n to cheer me  
I find in Thee my Star, my Sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior  
Doth now embrace and compass me  
The storms have ceased, my peace a river  
My soul a prisoned bird set free  
  
[Chorus]


A king is crying from his throne  
He had a queen but now she's gone  
What is this magic that we seek  
The mighty strong turn mighty weak  
Every good girl hears it  
Every bad boy fears it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
The power touches me  
The power helps us see  
The power holds my hand  
The power drives me crazy  
  
A flower grows, an old man dies  
And through it all we still survive  
A poor man screams but no one hears  
Ain't nothing changed much through the years  
Every bad day needs it  
Every good day breeds it  
No matter how it feels  
When it's real you know it's real  
Stronger than any bomb that any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus)  
And it won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Hey, hey  
Open up your eyes and see  
It won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Every good day needs it  
Every bad day needs it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
Stronger than any bomb any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus twice)  
The power drives me crazy  
If i believe and you believe  
And we believe everything is gonna be all right  
All right  
It just might  
  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)


Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river  
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea  
You lay your bets and then you pay the price  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.  
  
Communication is the problem to the answer  
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone  
The weather's turned and all the lines are down  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When there's nowhere to go  
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying  
And you're looking for the answer in his eyes.  
You think you're gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up.  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh you've got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor.  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When there's nowhere to go  
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying  
And you're looking for the answer in his eyes.  
You think you're gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up.  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh you've got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor.  
  
A compromise would surely help the situation  
Agree to disagree but disagree the part  
When after all it's just a compromise of  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love


The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight  
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look in your eyes  
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender a love that I could not forsake  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms  
When the world outside's too much to take  
That all ends when I'm with you  
Even though there may be times it seems I'm far away  
But never wonder where I am cause I am always by your side  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love  
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly  
The feeling that I can't go on is light years away  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love


SOGNO  
  
Va ti aspettero'  
II fiore nel giardino segna il tempo  
Qui disegnero' il giomo poi del tuo ritorno  
Sei cosi sicura del mio amore  
Da portarlo via con te  
Chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando ancora a me  
E se ti servira' lo mostri al mondo  
Che non sa che vita see'e'  
Nel cuore che distratto sembra assente  
Non sa che vita see'e'  
In quello che soltanto il cuore sente  
Non sa  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Tempo che non basta a cancellare  
Coi ricordi il desiderio che  
Resta chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando a me  
E ti accompagnera' passando le citta' da me  
Da me che sono ancora qui  
E sogno cose che non so di te  
Dove sara' che strada fara' il tuo ritorno  
Sogno  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Sogno  
Un rumore il vento che mi sveglia  
E sei gia' qua


There's a wind that blows  
Its calling your name  
And its speaks to me again and again  
Telling me go to her  
Don't let her go  
Hold her close to you  
Then you will know  
The meaning of love  
Exactly what is all about  
The feeling that I get when I can't forget  
Everything that makes me want to  
That's how deep it goes  
All I really know is that I love you so  
  
And if its the only thing I ever do  
Then I know its true  
That I should love someone like you  
Someone who believes in me  
Makes my voice to sing with a heart so free  
As sure as I can be  
For me if one dream can come true  
Then I will love someone like you  
  
In your eyes I see  
A life that could mean so much more  
With you next to me  
And if time is cruel  
Well I won't try to hide  
I could walk through fire  
With you by my side  
Cause after all if we want forever  
There's a hand to hold through the sad and cold  
When nobody wants to know you  
So never let it go  
And you'll never be alone  
Knowing that I love you so  
  
And if its the only thing I ever do  
Then I know its true  
That I should love someone like you  
Someone who believes in me  
Makes my voice to sing with a heart so free  
As sure as I can be  
For me if one dream can come true  
Then I will love someone like you  
  
So never let it go  
And you'll never be alone  
Knowing that I love you so  
  
And if its the only thing, the only thing I ever do  
Then I know its true  
That I should love someone like you  
Someone who believes in me  
Makes my voice to sing with a heart so free  
As sure as I can be  
For me if one dream can come true  
Then I will love someone like you  
  
Then I should love someone like you


Voglio restare cosi,  
Magari fino in fondo,  
Il mondo attorno ormai  
Non mi interessa piu.  
Mi basta averti qui  
E stringerti cosi.  
  
Mi basta un gesto tuo  
Un sorriso,  
Una parola,  
E un attimo cosi  
Vale un'eternita  
Accendi un fuoco e poi  
Restiamo soli!  
Noi.  
  
[English: "I Want To Stay Like This"]  
I want to stay like this  
If possible to the end  
By now the world around  
No longer interests me  
It is enough that you are here  
And I hold you like this  
  
A gesture from you is enough  
A smile,  
A word,  
And a moment like this  
Is worth an eternity.  
Light a fire and then  
Let's be alone!  
Us.


A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt tumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You start to feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
It's all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon somehow  
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
This comes to pass ...


A fool never learns  
To get away, just run away before his heart begins to break  
A fool never learns  
He'll wait around, just hang around to see how much his heart can take  
A fool never learns  
To some girls love is just a game  
And some girls treat all fool the same  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'm a gonna hang around, wait around  
Hope she'll love me again some day  
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls who'd love to be just mine  
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just can't remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'm a gonna hang around, wait around  
Hope she'll love me again some day  
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls who'd love to be just mine  
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just can't remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing


(That baby doll) Oooohh!!  
(Look out for her) Ba-a-a-aby doll  
(Especially) Hmmmmmm!!  
(The amateur)  
  
There's many a guy who'll sing you these blues  
His dream was a lie, his heart's in his shoes  
He wasn't so green, in ways he was smart  
Till she hit the scene and she took him apart  
He'll tell you as plain as day  
"Keep away from ba-a-a-a-a-a-aby doll"  
  
(That baby doll)  
(Look out for her)  
  
You'll see in her eyes the warning you should  
You oughta be ooh-eyed, she'll lose you but good  
As long as she's warm, the livin' is sweet  
Then she'll raise a storm, you're back on the street  
You might as well know, my friend, that's the end  
You're cooked, you're through  
(My friend, you're through)  
(You're cooked, you're through)  
  
She was my baby doll and she'll do the same to you  
  
(That baby doll)  
(Look out for her)


The Christmas tree is decorated, all the shopping's done  
Stockings line the fireplace one by one  
All the presents look so pretty, tied with brightly colored bows  
All these things help make this season still everybody knows  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Christmas needs hearts for a joy  
Carolers singing, silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Christmas needs hearts for a joy  
Carolers singing, silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love  


The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play  
Through a meadow land toward a closing door  
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before  
  
The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you  
  
(The lonely night discloses) Just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo.


Falling in love with love is falling for make believe  
Falling in love with love is playing the fool  
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy  
Learning to trust is just for children in school  
  
I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me  
  
Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me


If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you  
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms  
  
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go  
Every day remember how I love you so  
In your heart believe what in my heart I know  
That forevermore I'll wait for you  
  
The clock will tick away the hours one by one  
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done  
The time when you return and find me here and run  
Straight to my waiting arms  
  
If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you  
And forevermore sharing your love


If I could only go back again  
To the places where I have I have been  
Feeling love as we did then  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
Crystal waters of yesterday  
Golden rainbows you washed away  
Lonely clouds that can only say  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love like we did then  
To run free as the wind forever  
  
Silver wings of eternity  
Take me back like the child to see  
Faces lost in the memories  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love as we did then  
To run free as the wind forever, run


Hear the lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is winding low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
Where time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I'm so lonesome I could cry


It's a most unusual day  
Feel like throwing my worries away  
As an old native-born Californian would say  
It's a most unusual day  
There's a most unusual sky  
Not a sign of a cloud passing by  
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
It's a most unusual time  
I keep feeling my temperature climb  
If my heart won't behave in the usual way  
Well, there's only one thing to say  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
I keep feeling my temperature climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb  
Till there is only one thing to say  
It's a most, most, most, most, most unusual, most unusual  
Most unusual da-ay-ay  
Most unusual da-ay


This is the night of love  
The shining hour of Kalua  
Her song is in the air  
Her lips are waiting there  
Who will be Kalua's only love?  
  
Who will her lover be?  
Who will her lover be?  
  
Before the night is old  
My arms will hold Kalua  
And where the trandewinds blow  
Soft and low  
  
Our love will blossom bright  
In the night  
And stars will sing above  
The love song of Kalua


Where do I begin  
To tell the story  
Of how great a love can be  
The sweet love story  
That is older than the sea  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me  
Where do I start  
  
With her first hello  
She gave new meaning  
To this empty world of mine  
There'll never be  
Another love, another time  
She came into my life  
And made the living fine  
She fills my heart  
  
She fills my heart  
With very special things  
With angel songs  
With wild imaginings  
She fills my soul  
With so much love  
That anywhere I go  
I'm never lonely  
With her along who could be lonely  
I reach for her hand  
It's always there  
  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there


May each day in the week be a good day  
May the Lord always watch over you  
And may all of your hopes turn to wishes  
And may all of your wishes come true  
  
May each day in the month be a good day  
May you make friends with each one you meet  
And may all of your daydreams be mem'ries  
And may all of your mem'ries be sweet  
  
The weeks turn to months and the months into years  
There'll be sadness and joy, there'll be laughter and tears  
But one thing I pray to heaven above  
May each of your days be a day full of love  
  
May each day in the year be a good day  
May each dawn find you happy and gay  
And may all of your days be as lovely  
As the one you shared with me today  
  
May each day of your life be a good day  
And good night.  
  


I don't remember what day it was  
I didn't notice what time it wa-as  
All I know is that I fell in love with you  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you...  
  
Every day's a new day in love with you  
With each day comes a new way of loving you  
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away  
Cupid, we don't need you now, be on your way  
I thank the Lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger  
And I always will be true  
I know you feel the same way too  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every way's a new way, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day [fade]

One day of your life is all I'm askin' girl,  
Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world.  
If you give me one little moment I will make this moment last,  
I'll live the future with the past.  
  
One day of your life can't mean that much to you,  
It's only one day of your life, but it will see me through.  
If I can't have you for ever, if I can't have things my way  
I'll be content with just one day.  
  
If I must build a world of fantasy,  
Please with a memory.  
  
One day of your life is all I'm asking girl,  
Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world.  
If I can't have you for ever, if I can't have things my way  
I'll be content with just one day.  
  
One day of your life,  
Ooooh one day of your life,  
It's only one day of your life,  
Just give me only one day of your life  


Quiet nights and quiet stars  
Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
  
Quiet nights and quiet dreams  
Quiet walks by quiet streams  
And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely  
  
This is where to be  
Here with you so close to me  
Till the final flicker of life's ember  
  
I who was lost and lonely  
Believing life was a only a bitter tragic joke  
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh, my love  
  
(instrumental interlude)  
  
This is where to be  
Here with you so close to me  
Till the final flicker of life's ember  
  
I who was lost and lonely  
Believing life was a only a tragic joke  
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh, my love


Say it isn't so  
Say it isn't so.  
Everyone is saying you don't love me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
Everywhere I go,  
Everyone I know  
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say that you  
Found somebody new,  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Say it isn't true.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say passing by  
Say he's younger than I  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Tell me it's a lie.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.


Don't talk of stars burning above  
If you're in love show me  
Tell me no dreams filled with desire  
If you're on fire show me  
Here we are together in the middle of the night  
Don't talk of spring, just hold me tight  
Anyone whose ever been in love will tell you that  
This is no time for a chat  
  
Haven't your lips longed for my touch  
  
Don't say how much, show me, show me  
Don't talk of love lasting through time  
Make me no undying vow  
Show me show me  
  
Haven't your lips longed for my touch  
Don't say how much, show me, show me  
Don't talk of love lasting through time  
Make me no undying vow  
Show me show me now


What is so rare as a day in June?  
'Till now we have never been told  
The old question's answered by one that is new  
What is so rare, dear, as you?  
  
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair  
Sweet as a breath of air  
Fresh with the morning dew  
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne  
Orchids in cellophane  
Couldn't compare to you  
You are perfection you're my idea  
Of angels singing the Ave Maria  
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you  
With every beat of the heart that I give you  
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share  
Caring the way we care  
Ours is a love so rare  
  
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air  
Charming and debonaire  
Those are the words for you  
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare  
That "one in a million" air  
In everything you do  
You have that something, that certain manner  
You thrill me more than the "Star Spangled Banner"  
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender  
And in that love scene I gladly surrender  
So rare, to have a future like yours to share  
Sweetheart the way we care  


My first lesson  
In losin' love was you  
Learnin' to live with your memory  
Was lesson number two  
And I can't lie  
Baby I still cry sometimes  
But I've come a long way  
Towards gettin' you out of my mind  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
Sometimes your memory  
Still gets the best of me  
But that lonely ache in my heart  
Ain't as bad as it used to be  
And sometimes the way that I'm feelin'  
Inside doesn't show  
But I know  
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  


That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune  
We'd sing a song the whole night long and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
No paint was on the door (no paint was on the door)  
The grass grew through the floor (the grass grew through the floor)  
Of Tony's Two By Four (of Tony's Two By Four)  
On the Bilbao shore (on the Bilbao shore)  
But there were friends galore (howdy do, howdy do)  
And there was beer to pour (chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug)  
And moonlight on the shore (and the moon shines above)  
That old Bilbao shore (on the shore, not the floor)  
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune  
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all


Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity  
Have faith, believe in me, give me your hand  
Love is a symphony of perfect harmony  
When lovers such as we walk hand in hand  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look toward the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look up to the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  


It seems we stood and talked like this before  
We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when  
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore  
  
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
Some things that happened for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before, and loved before  
But who knows where or when


Sleigh bells ring  
are you listening  
in the lane  
snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
we're happy tonight  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
as we go along  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
we'll say: No man  
But you can do the job  
when you're in town  
  
Later on  
we'll conspire  
as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
the plans that we've made  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
and pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
until the all the kids knock him down  
  
When it snows  
ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
the Eskimo way  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
walking in a winter wonderland


Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
From the Broadway musical "My Fair Lady"  
  
  
I'm gettin' married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Pull out the stopper, let's have a whopper  
But get me to the church on time  
  
I gotta be there in the morning  
Spruced up and looking in my prime  
Girls, come and kiss me, show how you'll miss me  
But get me to the church on time  
  
If I am dancing, roll up the floor  
If I am whistling, whisk me out the door, for  
  
I'm gettin' married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Kick up a rumpus but don't lose your compass  
And get me to the church, get me to the church  
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time


Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
All I want is a room somewhere  
Far away from the cold night air  
With one enormous chair  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Lots of chocolate for me to eat  
Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat  
Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still  
I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  
  
Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee  
Warm and tender as 'e can be  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? (loverly)  
Loverly (lovely)  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?


You go on your way  
I'll go on mine  
Please don't you call me  
Or drop me a line  
  
I'll be better off now  
With somebody new  
And you should find someone  
More suited to you  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Let's fight another round  
  
I couldn't explain it  
I can't tell you why  
I've got such a talent  
For making you cry  
  
And one day you'll thank me  
For saying so long  
For making an end to  
A love that was wrong  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Let's fight another round  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other...


In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
"Some other time", that's whatcha say when I want you  
Then you laugh at me and make me cry  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
You don't seem to care a thing about me  
You'd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)  
  
[Chorus]  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
Once upon a time you used to smile and wave to me  
And walk with me but now you don't  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
Some other guy is takin' up all your time  
Now ya don't have any time for me  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
You don't seem to care a thing about me  
You'd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
(In summertime, in summertime when all the leaves are green)  
In the summertime, I'll be blue all the time  
Cause you don't want my love


Don't give up when you feel you are far away  
You can lose yourself in the sound like it's yesterday  
When the world won't stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on, we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone,  
  
Bring us back in time, to what we love.  
Chorus:  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
Don't give up, don't believe it could ever change  
You're not alone and everybody it feels the same  
When the world won't stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on, we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone,  
Bring us back in time, to what we love.  
Chorus:  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
Keeps us together and keep us strong  
When we're together music plays on and on.  
[Chorus:]  
When we ahh, when we ahh  
When we ahh, when we ahh  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
And he's what we all belong


That's my cigar  
You'll steal another  
Hey bumma's we got work to do  
Since when did you become me mada  
Ahh stop your ballin  
Hey who asked you?  
  
Try bottle alley or the harbor  
Try central park its garenteed  
Try any banker, bum or barba  
They almost all knows howda read  
  
I smell money  
You smell foul  
Met this girl last night  
Hey move you elbow  
Pass the towel  
For a buck I might  
  
Chorus:  
And its a fine life carrying the banner through it all  
A mighty fine life carrying the banner tough and tall  
Every morning we goes where we wishes  
Wes as free as finshes  
Sure beets washin dishes  
What a fine life carrying the banner through it all  
  
Its takes a smile as sweet as butta  
The kind the ladies can't resist  
It takes an orphane with a studda  
Who aint afraid to use his fist  
  
Summa stinks and winters wating  
Welcome to new york  
Boy aint nature fasinating  
When yous gotta walk  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint it a fine life carrying th banner through it all!


There was a time  
Everybody was around and I was dancing with you  
We all went down to the party Friday night  
And had a drink there or two  
Oh what a heat  
I feel love and heart beat  
It's electricity  
Majestic sound, round and round and round, got you next to me  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Time after time everybody came around  
And I was dancing with you  
Don't know your name,  
Making me ashamed  
To feel the way that I do  
The lights went out  
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be  
I won't forget  
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a woman in love  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a woman in love so high  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Feel my heartbeat  
Feel my heartbeat  
Feel my heartbeat  
  
There was a time when everybody was around and I was dancing with you  
Don't know your name,  
Making me ashamed  
To feel the way that I do  
The lights went out  
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be  
I won't forget  
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you


Grace: We got Annie.  
  
Gardener: We've got Annie?  
  
Grace: Yeah!  
She's like the shine on your shoes,  
or hearing a blues that's great.  
Makes you relax,  
like a big tax rebate!  
We got Annie!  
  
Servants: We got Annie! We got Annie? We got Annie!  
  
Mrs. Pugh: And Benny Goodman's got swing.  
Bing is a king, by far.

All  
  
Today we're living in a shanty  
Today we're scrounging for a meal  
  
Sophie  
  
Today I'm stealing coal for fires  
Who knew I could steal?  
  
Men  
  
I used to winter in the tropics  
  
Women  
  
I spent my summers at the shore  
  
Fred  
  
I used to throw away the paper  
  
All  
He don't anymore!  
We'd like to thank you: Herber Hoover  
For really showing us the way  
We'd like to thank you: Herbert Hoover  
You made us what we are today  
  
Prosperity was 'round the corner  
A cozy cottage built for two  
In this blue heaven  
That you  
Gave us  
Yes!  
  
We're turning blue!  
They offered us Al Smith and Hoover  
We paid attention and we chose  
Not only did we pay attention  
We paid through the nose.  
  
In ev'ry pot he said "a chicken"  
But Herbert Hoover he forgot  
Not only don't we have the chicken  
We ain't got the pot!  
Hey Herbie  
  
Women  
  
You left behind a greatful nation  
  
All  
  
So, Herb, our hats are off to you  
We're up to here with admiration  
  
Sophie  
  
Come down and have a little stew  
  
All  
  
Come down and share some Christmas dinner  
Be sure to bring the missus too  
We got no turkey for our stuffing  
So why don't we stuff you  
We'd like to thank you, Herbert Hoover  
For really showing us the way  
You dirty rat, you Bureaucrat, you  
Made us what we are today  
Come and get it, Herb!


Baby I got love for thee  
So deep inside of me I don't know where to start  
I love you more than anything  
But the words cant even touch what's in my heart  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding insane  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
  
And I say baby, baby  
Baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby, baby (Ooh oh)  
  
Baby I'm so down for you  
No matter what you do (real talk) I'll be around  
Oh baby, see baby I been feelin' you  
Before I even knew what feelings were about  
Oh baby  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
  
And I say baby, baby  
Baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby  
  
Straight up, you got me  
All in, how could I not be  
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)  
If it's even possible, I love you more  
Than word love can say it  
It's better not explaining that's why I keep saying baby I  
  
Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby, baby (baby)  
Baby, baby (baby I)  
Ooh baby oh baby oh baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby  
(Baby I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby


[Verse 1]  
If you want it, take it  
I should have said it before  
Tried to hide it, fake it  
I can't pretend anymore  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
You were better, deeper  
I was under a spell  
Like a deadly fear I am, babe  
On the highway to hell  
  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Bridge]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
(Our love baby, oooh)  
The thought on your body  
I came alive  
It was lethal  
It was fatal  
In my dreams it felt so right  
But I woke up and pretend  
Oh baby  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more


If you were mine, boy! There would no be no moon or sun, because I'm truly  
In love with you and me and my girls don't know what-to-do oh oh oh  
See it wasn't that cool, we was just chilin at the pool  
And my homegirl said girl, is there any why we can for a twirl  
But things got kinda heavy so we jumped into my new chevy and  
That's when I seen the new boy from the team Hey, man it's me  
Direct contact aint a thing I could do, I'm too shy but you make me wanna  
Cry but that's not what I'm used too, if you were mine, boy! There would be  
No moon or sun, because I'm truly in love with you and me and my girls don't  
Know what-to-do oh oh oh, should I make contact? No, don't do that  
So I'll probably leave until my heart says I can't take no more, never felt  
Like this before. Direct contact ah ah ah no more.


(Hahaha) lalala uhuh  
Been runnin' 'round in circles  
Tryin' to find the end (end)  
Bumped into this shy guy  
While chillin' with my friends (friends)  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, you got me open  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2  
  
Crazy what we're doin'  
Livin' lettin' go  
Ridin' havin' good times  
And no one has to know  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, (fire) you got me open (you got me)  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2  
  
We got that jam, make them dance  
Make them lose their mi-i-i-i-inds x4  
  
I got that fire, (fire) you got me open (you got me)  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x4


I looked in my rear view mirror and  
It seemed to make a lot more sense  
Than what I see ahead of us,  
Ahead of us, yeah.  
Uh I'm ready to make that turn  
Before we both crash and burn  
'Cause that could be the death of us,  
The death of us,  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And You decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
Hey, What happened to the butterflies  
Guess they didn't count at that stop sign  
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light  
Hey, right when I think that we found it  
Well that's when we start turnin' around  
You're saying baby don't worry  
But we're still going the wrong way baby  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
They say only fools fall in love  
Well they must've been talking about us  
And sometimes I feel like, I've been here before  
Ah  
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right  
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight  
Honey I know  
Yeah, we can find our way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
My baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decide not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in  
Traffic, I'm under  
Pressure  
Pressure  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Avenue  
  
Let's just go back  
Back back back


[Verse 1]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
I don't ever ask you where you've been  
And I don't feel the need to  
Know who you're with  
I can't even think straight but I can tell  
That you were just with her  
And I'll still be a fool  
I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't ever tell you how I really feel  
Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean  
And nothing's ever easy  
That's what they say  
I know I'm not your only  
But I'll still be a fool  
Cause I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, (Just a little bit) oh, oh (Hallelujah)  
  
[Bridge]  
(Just a little bit, oh yeah)  
I know I'm not you're only  
But at least I'm one  
I hear a little love is better than none  
Oh babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit baby)  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Verse 1]  
Every day I'm grindin'  
I don't even get a weekend  
Been livin' my life  
In black and white, no sleeping  
So tonight I'm gonna flip it  
Like in a New York minute  
We're gonna hail a cab  
And don't look back  
Once we get in it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't need no guest list  
Everybody's invited  
I said even if you can't get in  
We'll dance outside it  
We're gonna make this bubble  
Carbonate some trouble  
When the night gets black  
Gotta take it back to another level  
  
Lemme hear you say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la

Can't keep it bottled up  
Lemme hear you say

This for my number one girl who got the top spot title  
Spent a hour in the bathroom walked out looking like a model  
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo  
On the moon, Who needs genies in a bottle girl  
If they already got you  
  
Boy you make me feel so lucky  
Finally the stars align  
Never has it been so easy, to be in love  
And to give you this heart of mine  
You know what I need (Eh! )  
I know what you like (Eh! )  
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)  
How could this be wrong  
When it feels so right  
Yeah, I really love you I really love you  
  
And I'll never let you go  
You should know

I'm always gonna stay  
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)  
Right there (right there)  
'Cause you listen  
And you care  
You're so different  
No one compares  
And if you never change

You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)  
You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)  
  
And I get butterflies, just thinking  
About you boy, you're on my mind  
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming  
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time  
You know what I need (Eh! )  
I know what you like (Eh! )  
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)  
How could this be wrong  
When it feels so right  
I really need you

And you care  
You're so different  
No one compares  
And if you never change  
I'm gonna stay right there (What, Okay, What)  
I'll always be right there  
  
Now if all fell through it  
Would you catch me before the pavement  
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation  
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting  
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary  
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary  
My black book, and numbers thicker than the dictionary  
And bible I got to recycle  
I love and I like you  
Five course meals even though you don't mind a drive-thru  
That's why I got you  
  
And I'll never let you go (I got you)  
You should know  
I'm never gonna change  
I'm always gonna stay  
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)  
Right there  
Cause you listen  
And you care  
You're so different  
No one compares  
And if you never change  
I'm gonna stay right there  
I'll always be right there  
  
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)  
You got it, I'll always be right there  
Always be right there, you got it, you got it babe  
You got it, you got it babe  
You got it, you got it babe  
You got it, you got it babe

Verse 3:  
-


You may not show it  
I may not know it  
But it's real as it can be  
You need no season  
I need no reason  
When it's your heart singin'  
This was meant to be  
  
When you're both in love  
Both in love...  
Seein' eye to eye and feelin'  
Heart to heart  
Yes, we're both in love  
Both in love  
With each other from the start  
Ev'rythin's magic  
When we're together  
In this wonderland for two  
There's nothing like it  
Won't try to hide it  
Anyone can tell there's nothin' you can do  
  
There's no need to worry  
Which starts we're under  
We've got all we need to know  
We have the answer  
Forever after  
You're the one for me  
And I'm the one for you  
(Instrumental)


(Lea)  
I've been thinking  
It seems we're going nowhere  
You don't share my feelings  
It doesn't seem fair  
I guess there's nothing  
Much more I can do  
I know I've got to try  
And make it without you  
I don't love you anymore  
Can't you see, it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
There's nothing left to say  
I've gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
(Ariel)  
We've had bad times  
But that's no reason to go  
I can't live without you  
I need you, don't you know  
That I still love you  
Don't, don't do this to me  
You know I won't make it alone  
Can't you see  
(L) I don't love you anymore  
(A) Don't do this to me  
(L) Can't you see it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
(A) That's no reason to go  
(L) There's nothing left to say  
(A) I can't live without you  
(L) I 've gotta go my way  
(A) Oh no...  
(L) I don't love you anymore  
(A) Don't do this to me

If there's no other way  
Then, go


sana'y kaya kong gawin na malimutan ka  
sana'y maitago ko ang luha ng mga mata  
sana'y kayang tiisin na magmula ngayo'y di na magkita pa  
ngayong wala ka na  
  
ii stanza  
ang akala ko noon ay di kita mahal  
at ang pagtingin sayo'y isang laro lamang  
labis na sinaktan ka at sa ngayo'y nagpapaalam na...  
di mapigilan pa  
  
chorus:  
minamahal pala kita  
ngayon ko lamang nadama  
hindi mo na kaya mapapatawad pa  
patawad na  
at kung mahal mo pa ako  
ang puso ko'y pakinggan mo  
at maririnig sa bawat pagtibok  
tumatawag at nagmamahal sayo...  
  
repeat (ii stanza)  
repeat(chorus)  
  
di akalain na pagsisisihan ko  
bakit ngayon lang nadamang may pagtingin pala sayo...  
  
repeat(chorus)  
tumatawag at nagmamahal sayooohhhhhh....


I was watching the news tonight  
And all over the world  
People were singing and carrying signs  
All over the world  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
Through cities that I've been  
And though I'm not there tonight  
You know I'll be back again  
I'll be back again, I'll be back again  
I'm on a plane tonight for Germany  
And all over the world  
There are lots of people just like you and me  
All over the world  
Who know the bomb must never fall again  
All over the world  
And we must all learn how to live as friends  
All over the world  
All over the world, all over the world  
We are making the news tonight  
All over the world  
Because we know that what we do is right  
All over the world  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
All over the world  
Through the streets of Europe and Japan  
All over the world  
All over the world, all over the world  


Anytime you're feelin' lonely  
Anytime you're feelin' blue  
Anytime you feel downhearted  
That will prove your love for me is true  
  
Anytime you""re thinkin' about me  
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you  
So anytime you say you want me back again  
That's the time I'll come runnin' back to you  
  
Anytime you're feelin' lonely  
Anytime you're feelin' blue  
Anytime you feel downhearted  
That will prove your love for me is true  
  
Anytime you're thinkin' about me  
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you  
So anytime you say you want me back again  
That's the time I'll be comin' back to you


Traditional, arranged  
By Arlo Guthrie  
Come all you old time cowboys  
And listen to my song  
Please do not grow weary  
I'll not detain you long  
Concerning some wild cowboys  
Who did agree to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo.  
Well I found myself in Griffin  
In eighteen eighty-three  
When a man by the name of Creagho  
Come a'walkin' up to me  
Sayin "How do you do young fella  
And how'd you like to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo".  
Well me being out of work right then  
To that drover I did say  
"My goin' out on the buffalo range  
Depends upon the pay  
But if you pay good wages,  
Transportation to and fro  
I think I might go with you  
On the range of the Buffalo".  
Well yes I pay good wages  
And transportation too  
If you'll agree to work for me  
Until the season's through  
But if you do get homesick  
And you try and run away  
You'll starve to death out on the trail  
And you'll also lose your pay  
Well with all the flatterin' talkin'  
He signed up quite a train  
Some ten or twelve in number  
Of able bodied men  
And our trip it was a pleasant one  
Through all New Mexico  
Until we crossed Pease River  
On the range of the buffalo  
It was there our pleasures ended  
And our troubles all begun  
A lightnin' storm come up on us  
And made the cattle run  
We got full of the stickers  
On the cactus that did grow  
And the outlaws waited to pick us off  
In the hills of Mexico  
Well the working season ended  
But the drover would not pay  
He said "You spent your money boys  
You're all in debt to me".  
But the cowboys never put much stock  
In a thing like a bankrupt law  
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach  
On the range of the buffalo.  
  


Children of Abraham, what's your story?  
Killing each other for a piece of land  
Children of Abraham, this ain't glory  
You've got to walk together hand in hand  
  
Take down the flags that just separate the people  
Take down the wire on the boundary  
Take back the words that were spoken in anger  
You've got to live just like a family  
  
Children of Abraham,I must be dreaming  
Rivers of blood running through your hands  
Children crying, mothers screaming  
It just wasn't looking like the Promised Land


Coming in from London from over the pole  
Flyin' in a big jet liner  
Chicks are flyin' everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer?  
  
Comin' into Los Angeles  
Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico  
No, he couldn't look much stranger  
Walkin' in the hall with his things and all  
Smilin, said he was the lone ranger  
  
Comin' into Los Angeles  
Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Hip woman walkin' on the movin' floor  
Trippin' on the escalator  
There's a man in the line and she's blowin' his mind  
Thinkin' that he's already made her

Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man

Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Yeah, alright!


This morning I woke up alone  
I spent the day time on my own  
Lots of people have come and gone  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
Last night I sat till closing time  
Thinking of the things that crossed my mind  
You were the one I was thinking of  
I guess it must be that I'm just in love  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right, it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
I hope they play this song of mine  
On the jukebox for a dime  
Then if you leave 'cause something's wrong  
You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  


Well, the new sheriff wrote me a letter  
Yes, the new sheriff wrote me a letter  
Come up and see me, dead or alive  
Come up and see me, dead or alive  
  
Dead or alive, if s a hard road

New sheriff, I'm a poor boy  
  
If s a hard road, dead or alive  
Dead or alive, if s a hard road

I don't like your hard rock hotel  
Dead or alive, new sheriff  
No thanks, I'm a poor boy  
  
If s a hard road, dead or alive  
Dead or alive, if s a hard road

Gonna go down and see my little sweet thing  
Dead or alive, yes, Lord!  
No thanks, new sheriff  
  
If s a hard road, dead or alive  
Dead or alive, if s a hard road


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
I remember when I met you  
Underneath the evening sky  
Now it seems I could forget you  
Rescue me, I'm bound to die  
All the promises we made there  
With no words to understand  
And though I've tried I've come up empty  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
CHORUS:  
I'm going down for the third time  
And I need a helping hand  
The rooster crows and I'm sinking  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
Where are you, my dear companion  
How much longer must you be  
I'm all alone out on the ocean  
When will you come and rescue me  
It's too late for new beginnings  
In this world I've left behind  
There is nothing left worth keeping  
Not a thing to change my mind  
CHORUS  
How far down the road to glory  
Must we go without a sign  
Caught out on these stormy waters  
How can you treat me so unkind  
Did you know from the beginning  
That I'd dig this lousy hole  
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned  
In this dark night of the soul  
CHORUS  
  


Gonna sit right here and sing myself a tune  
That I wrote one afternoon after everyone had gone  
And I know that this won't mean a lot to you  
You've got better things to do but for me I'll just go on  
Old dog is lying in the middle of the road  
He don't do nothing 'cause he don't want to  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he sits around, the less I want to do too  
Gonna sit right here and watch the world roll by  
Till we both just up and die watching clouds and eating flies  
Don't want to bother no one, don't want nothing here to change  
A dusty road is all we've ever dreamed of  
And I think I'm gonna love this life  
Maybe someday take a wife  
She can join us if she wants to  
Ain't nobody gonna tell what to do  
If a car comes we just move  
And we both move real smooth  
Like old dog is moving must be something in the air  
Some bitch is coming up the road now  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he gets around, the more I want to do too  


I dream in the morning  
That she brings me water  
And I dream in evening  
That she brings me wine  
Just a poor man's daughter  
From Puerto Penasco  
Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
There's a great hot desert  
South of Mexicali  
And if you don't have water  
Then you better not go  
Tequila won't get you  
Across the desert  
To Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
And the fire I feel for the  
Woman I love  
Is driving me insane  
Knowing she's waiting  
And I just can't get there  
Lord only knows that I've  
Racked my brain  
To try and find a way  
To see that woman in old Mexico  
  
I met a kind man  
Who guarded the border  
He said you don't have papers  
But I'll let you go  
I can tell that you love her  
By the look in your eyes now  
She's the rose of the desert  
In old Mexico  
  
And the fire I feel for the  
Woman I love  
Is driving me insane  
Knowing she's waiting  
And I just can't get there  
Lord only knows that I've  
Racked my brain  
To try and find a way  
To see the woman in old Mexico  
  
And I dream in the morning  
That she brings me water  
And I dream in the evening  
That she brings me wine  
Just a poor man's daughter  
From Puerto Penasco  
Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
There's a great hot desert  
South of Mexicali  
And if you don't have water  
Then you better not go  
Tequila won't get you  
Across the desert  
To Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
She's the rose of the desert  
In old Mexico


Words and Music Arlo Guthrie  
Every hand in the land  
Shakes along with me  
It don't seem that I can dream  
Like I used to dream  
Maybe that somebody is shaking me  
If I fell I could tell  
It may be that somebody is making me  
Dream that you're forever  
Gone away from me  
Every toe that I know  
Step away with me  
I can't seem to get where  
I want to be  
Maybe it's my own foot  
That keeps tripping me  
Trip trap - flip flap  
It must come to wherever from it comes  
Through to me  
I can't walk to where  
My own dreams talk to me  
Every face in this place  
Take your eyes away  
Blink if you think that  
There's another way  
Maybe it's my own eyes  
That don't see the way  
The time is blind  
It may come to pass  
That I will lose my mind  
I can't live without the love I left behind  
I can't live without the love I left behind  
  


Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides  
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black  
All except beneath the trees of Eden  
The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Through its shadow's metal badge  
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine  
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign  
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden  


o to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Can't you hear the steel rail humming  
That's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Do not think about tomorrow  
Let tomorrow come and go  
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Safe from all the wind and snow  
  
I know the police cause you trouble  
They cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You won't find no policemen there  
  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
And your hair is turning grey  
Lift your head and smile at trouble  
You'll find happiness some day  
  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Don't you feel the steel rail humming  
That's a hobo's lullaby


I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan  
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan  
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw  
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw  
  
Chorus:  
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow  
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go  
  
Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son  
One went to college, the other went wrong  
His wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight  
But still he's a-singin' from mornin' till night  
  
Chorus  
  
When I die, take my saddle from the wall  
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall  
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West  
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best  
  
Chorus  
  
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan  
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan  
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw  
Their tails are all matted, and their backs are all raw  
  
Chorus


We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
Brothers, sisters, all  
  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Brothers, sisters, all  
  
We are dancing Sarah's circle  
We are dancing Sarah's circle  
We are dancing Sarah's circle  
Sisters, brothers, all  
  
Every round a generation  
Every round a generation  
Every round a generation  
Sisters, brothers, all  
  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
Brothers, sisters, all


Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
  
[CHORUS:]  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way  
Won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down, my head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro  
I must declare that my heart is there  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico  
  
[CHORUS]  
Down at the market you can hear  
Ladies cry out while on their head they bear  
Ackie rice and salt fish is nice  
And the rum is good any time of year  
  
[CHORUS]  
[CHORUS]


[CHORUS:]  
Lying on the side of the road  
Feeling like he heard a sound  
Shivered with the feelin' that he knowed  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
She gave John a present that was fine  
So fine that he had to go  
Went to see what it was that he knowed  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
And I know it's hard  
But what did you expect of her?  
John looked down  
  
If you see the lady in your mind  
Even in her nothingness  
Standing through the darkest night  
And the people want to fight  
But first ask if it's all right  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
[CHORUS]  
And I know it's hard  
But what did you expect of her?  
John looked down


Words and music by Ed McCurdy  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd ever dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war  
I dreamed I saw a mighty room  
Filled with women and men  
And the paper they were signing said  
They'd never fight again  
And when the paper was all signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands and bowed their heads  
And grateful pray'rs were prayed  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing 'round and 'round  
While swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd never dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war.  
  


Lonely sunshine, days come easy,  
Spend my time alone at rest,  
And if I were the last to leave here,  
Now would these roads be any less?  
  
Oh, I'm the last to leave.  
Now would these ribbon highway roads  
Be less wonderful to me?  
Why must I always be so slow?  
  
Many friends come and go,  
You know there's a lot of feelings that I've left behind,  
And it's a lonely world, I know,  
When your friends are hard to find.  
  
But take the time, my memory fails,  
And soak my eyes in the morning rain,  
Like a sailor, sailing over Jordan,  
On the road back home again.  
  
Oh, I'm the last to leave.  
Would these ribbon highway roads  
Be less wonderful to me?  
Why must I always be so slow?


I want to hop on the last train in the station  
Won't need to get yourself prepared  
When you're on that last train for glory  
You'll know you're reasonably there  
  
Maybe you ain't walked on any highway  
You've just been flyin' in the air  
But if you're on that last train to glory  
You'll know you must have paid your fare  
  
Maybe you've been lying down in the jailhouse  
Maybe you are hungry and poor  
Maybe your ticket on the last train to glory  
Is the stranger who is sleeping on your floor  
  
I ain't a man of constant sorrow  
I ain't seen trouble all day long  
We are only passengers on the last train to glory  
That will soon be long, long gone  
  
I want to hop on the last train in the station  
Won't need to get yourself prepared  
When you're on the last train to glory  
You'll know you're reasonably there


  
CHORUS:  
LAY DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
WE'VE BOTH GOT TO SLEEP ON THE COLD, COLD GROUND  
THE WINDS BLOWIN' COLDER AND THE SUN'S GOIN' DOWN  
LAY DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
WE HIT THIS OLD BEEF TRAIL JUST TWO MONTHS AGO  
WE BLISTERED IN THE SUN AND WE FROZE IN THE SNOW  
IN TEN DAYS WE'RE COMIN TO A PACKING HOUSETOWN  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
THIS DODGE CITY TRAIL SHE'S A HARD ROAD TO GO  
UP THE TEXAS FLATLANDS THROUGH OLD MEXICO  
I GOT DUST IN MY EYES AND MUD IN MY NOSE  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
CHORUS  
THAT BAD HOLE OF WATER WE DRUNK AND GOT SICK  
CURLED UP OUT HAIR, TIED OUR TAILS BACK IN KINKS  
WE GOT LOST IN A BLIND CANYON, TIPPY-TOEIN' AROUND  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
HERE NOW WE COME TO THE END OF OUR TRAIL  
YOUR HAIR, HIDE AND CARCASS TO THE STOCKYARDS I SELL  
I'LL SEE YOU IN A TIN CAN WHEN YOU GET SHIPPED AROUND  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN

Coming down the highway, running like a wind  
Gonna beat the sunset to the coast and back again  
Moving through the shadows, almost going blind  
Living like a legend before my time  
If the road don't kill me, baby, I'll see you in the spring  
Making up for lost time between us seems like everything  
If I can make it home alright, you know, I'll treat you fine  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby  
With your man out on the road  
So I'll be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
I'm running out of highways and bridges to burn  
This kind of living is taking its toll on what I've learned  
You know, it ain't easy leaving you behind  
Living like a legend before my time  
But someday, baby, I'll be coming home to stay  
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day  
Ooh, I'm going out of my mind  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby  
With your man out on the road  
So I'll be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
I'll be getting up early 'cause I know, I'm coming home  
I'm so tired of living this legend life alone  
Kick off your shoes, babe, we'll drink a little wine  
Forget about living like a legend before my time  
Forget about living like a legend  
Just forget about the road  
So, look out for me, darling  
On account of your man is coming home  


Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn  
It's time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern  
We'll be gone before the dawn returns  
Like voices onthe wind.  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that our dreams have run aground  
There's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town  
None of us are caring where we're bound  
Like voices on the wind.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
"They're throwing it all away"  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away.  
  
Go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out  
We're on our way to nowhere now, can't bring the helm about  
None of us are left in any doubt  
We won't be back again.  
  
Send a message to the fleet, they'll search for us in vain  
We won't be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main  
Tell the ones we left home not to wait  
We won't be back again.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
"They're throwing it all away"  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away.  
  
Our time is just a point along a line  
That runs forever with no end  
I never thought that we would come to find  
Ourselves upon these rocks again.  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn...

I got a feelin' called the blues,  
Since my baby said good-bye  
Lawd I don't know what l'll do  
All I do is sit and sigh  
That last long day she said goodbye  
Well Lawd, I thought I would cry  
She'd do me, she'd do you,  
She's got that kind of lovin'  
Lawd, I love to hear her  
When she calls me sweet daddy  
  
Such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it's all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
I've grown so used to you somehow  
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now  
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
  
Lawd I tried and tried to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is leavin'  
This is all I say...

Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
And I can see a fisherman  
His day's catch Iying on the sand  
Underneath the palms that sway  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS:  
Now I'm missing your silver moon  
Black sands and your blue lagoon  
Some day I would like to be  
Back next to your shining sea  
Drinking rum from a conch shell  
Caught up in your magic spell  
Some day I would like to go  
Back down to Mexico  
I remember your fields of cane  
Your warm breezes and jungle rains  
And watching the children play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And out in your market square  
The women sing out to sell their wares  
I've got fresh shrimp today  
From Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
And under the spell of night  
The bay reflecting the harbor light  
You can hear the guitar play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And if you're thinking about romance  
And you're willing to take a chance  
Just pick any small cafe  
In Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
  
  


Like a dream in the night  
As the snow settles white  
There's a fire burning bright  
In Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill  
That keeps us from the chill  
And by the grace of God  
We will be in Massachusetts  
You can tell me about the times you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
Please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same  
The sun comes up to meet the dawn  
And there's a day that must go on  
There's another night that's gone  
In Massachusetts  
And I could spend all of my days  
And remain each day amazed  
At the way each day is phrased  
In Massachusetts  
You can tell me about the times you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
Please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same  
Now if you could only see  
I know you would agree  
There ain't nowhere else to be  
Like Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill  
That keeps us from the chill  
And by the grace of God  
We will be in Massachusetts  
Come on tell me about the time you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
And please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same as Massachusetts  


I'm growing tired of the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor, tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue, so blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Memories are bringing happy days of yore  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Mocking birds are singing 'round the cabin door  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always alone and blue  
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore  
Miss the Mississippi and you  


Words and music by James Rider  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician and I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way  
  
Crossed over the border to a mystical land  
Sort of unexpected didn't quite understand  
On a razor's edge on a grain of sand  
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion  
  
On a roll of the dice we headed out west  
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us  
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand  
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs  
  
On a turn of the cards I lightened my load  
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds  
On target and calm the vision was clear  
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here  
  
On a flip of the coins we rode the coast  
Tryin' to make the most of every situation  
That we witnessed near at hand  
On a drifter's crusade all over the land  
  
Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars  
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards  
In a change of your mind in the passing of time  
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way


Hello again the mornin' dawn has burned away  
The midnight mist  
Now and then I feel so fine  
And now and then I don't feel lonely  
Now and then and only in my mind  
  
I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay  
Now and then I talk with you  
And now and then you turn me on  
Now and then and when I don't feel blue  
  
Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you  
Pleased to understand that you are there, in the air  
Now and then you turn me on  
Now and then you must be gone  
Now and then I said  
Say so long, now and forever then


Many a month has come and gone  
Since I've wandered from my home  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Many a page of my life has turned  
Many lessons I have learned  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
Ridin' my pony on the reservation  
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
A cowboy's life is my occupation  
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born  
  
But as I sit here today  
Many mile's I am away  
From the place I rode my pony  
Through the draw  
  
Where the oak and black-jack trees  
Kiss the playful prairie breeze  
And I feel back in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Now as I turn life a page  
To the land of the great Osage  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Where the black oil rolls and flows  
And the snow white cotton grows  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Living now here but for fortune  
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes  
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Arise sweet destiny, time runs short  
All of your patience has heard their retort  
Hear us now for alone we can't seem  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Can you hear the words being whispered  
All along the American stream  
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned  
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few  
You and your children with nothing to do  
Hear us now for alone we can't seem  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
  
  


Bad news, bad news, come to me where I sleep  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Sayin' one of my friends is in trouble deep  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ears  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Juliet prison for ninety-nine years  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
A crash on the highway threw a car into a field  
Turn, turn, turn again  
There were four people killed and he was at the wheel  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
But I knew him as well as I know my own self  
Turn, turn, turn again  
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
That may be so said the judge from the side of his mouth  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But the witness who saw it, he left little doubt  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
He may, he may have a sentence to server  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But ninety-nine years, he just does not deserve  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
Too late, too late, for his case it is sealed  
Turn, turn, turn again  
A sentence, it is passed and it can not be repealed  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
But he ain't no criminal and his crime it is none  
Turn, turn, turn again  
And what happened to him could have happened to anyone  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
At that the judge jumped forward and his face it did freeze  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Sayin', ?Would you kindly leave my office now, please?  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
I squinted my eyes and I stood up slow  
Turn, turn, turn again  
With no other choice except for me to go  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
I walked down the hall and I heard his door slam  
Turn, turn, turn again  
I walked down the stairs but I did not understand  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
And I played my guitar through the night and through the day  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But the only tune that my guitar would play  
Was oh how cruel, the wind and the rain  


by T-Bone Burnett  
The power of love can make a blind man see  
Can bring a man to his knees  
  
The power of love can make a sultan grieve  
Can make a skeptic believe  
  
[CHORUS:  
The power of love is south of south  
And scorches out all the doubt  
  
The power of love is the name of names  
And burns away all the pain  
  
The power of love can make a gangster cry  
Can make a loser try  
  
The power of love can make a strong man weak  
Can make a bigot meek  
  
[CHORUS]  
The power of love can make a coward brave  
Can make a hero afraid  
  
The power of love can make a miser give  
Can make a dead man live

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
In the event of my demise  
Be sure to include this statement  
When you are bent on closing my eyes  
Thinking about what my life meant  
Alone on a hill back in '65  
Things looked a lot like changing  
Singing our songs that we harmonized  
Dreaming of worlds rearranging  
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight  
Maybe it's time someone told you  
Just because you say you've seen the light  
Doesn't mean nobody sold you  
I can remember all of your smiles  
During the demonstrations  
Taking on what seemed like the whole world  
Igniting the hearts of our nations  
And together we sang our victory songs  
Though we were worlds apart  
Every thing then has now passed away  
Except for the love in my heart  
Sitting at home on computerized beds  
Tryine to come to conclusions  
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads  
Ignoring the states of illusion  
Drunk in a world of material wealth  
No one can notice you falling  
Fantastic flights once good tor your health  
Now make you deaf to your calling  
And all alone the prophet groans  
With words as yet unseen  
Who'll be awake when the master returns  
Who will be lost in their dreams  
So in the event of my demise  
8e sure to include this statement  
Only the words of love kept alive  
Are worthy of not being wasted  
  
  


When evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains  
And there's nothing left to do but lay around  
I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
Ridin' down the canyon to watch the sun go down  
A picture that no artist 'ere could paint  
Cactus plants are bloomin' on the mountain side  
I hear a coyote calling to its mate  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
When evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains  
And there's nothing left to do but lay around  
I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down


Words and music by Pete Seeger  
Sailng down my golden river  
Sun and water all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Sun and water, old life givers  
L'll have them where ere I roam  
And I was not far from home  
Sunlight glancing on the water  
Life and death are all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Life for all my sons and daughters  
Golden sparkles in the foam  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down this winding highway  
Travelers from near and far  
And I was never alone  
Exploring all the little byways  
Sighting all the distant stars  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down my golden river  
Sun and water all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Sun and water, old life givers  
L'll have them where ere I roam  
And I was not far from home  
Yet I was never alone  
And I was not far from home  
  


The Missouri, she's a might riverAway you rolling river  
The red man's camp lies on her bordersAway, we're bound away across the wide

Missouri Shenandoah, I love your daughterAway you rolling river

I've been to wild Montana  
I went there in a storm  
My boots were Texas leather  
My Levis wet and torn  
  
I loved it in Montana  
Loved it in the storm  
I think I'm gonna cross that river  
I just might be reborn  
  
New York, New York, winter, '61  
Takin' me a city ride  
Somebody tall musta put out the lights  
'Cause it got real dark outside  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I never saw the sun till '71  
But I never gave up the fight  
I sure was glad when I saw the dawn  
Somebody, somebody turned on the light  
Somebody turned on the light  
  
Women, wine, and fast red cars  
And I couldn't seem to read the signs  
Somebody said, "Whose life is this?"  
And I said that it can't be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the world is wrong, better right yourself  
It'll make the dark clouds fly  
Nobody tall can put out the lights  
Just don't let the spirit die  
  
If you never see the sun till '91  
Don't you ever give up the fight  
Sure be glad when you see the dawn  
Somebody, somebody turns on the light  
Somebody turns on the light


Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew  
I will be with you  
Someday we will meet again  
When we meet, I'll see you then  
If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
It will make this farewell seem  
Little more than but a dream  
If you only knew  
Dreams are often true  
Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
Someday when we meet again  
When we meet our sorrows end  
If you only knew  


Every morning just as soon as it's light  
Get out of bed and I'm feeling alright  
Make me some coffee and I sit down alone  
The rest of the day I'm on the telephone  
Hang up, hold on  
You got a dime so you come on so strong  
Save your money and let me be  
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me  
I got a phone in my bedroom and one in the barn  
A phone in my car and one in the yard  
A phone on my saddle for when I'm out on the range  
A phone in my pocket for when I'm down at the grange  
Hang up, hold on  
You got a dime so you come on so strong  
Save your money and let me be  
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me  
Now with devaluation all over the land  
The whole wide world has got more money in their hand  
They'll be calling me up from Peking and Nome  
I'm going to rip out my telephone  


I struck the trail in seventy-nine  
The herd strung out behind me  
As I jogged along my mind went back  
To the gal I left behind  
If I ever get off the trail, boys  
And the Indians don't find me  
I'll make my way straight back again  
To the gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that true little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that pretty little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
The wind did blow and the rain did flow  
The hail did fall and blind me  
And I thought of that gal, that sweet little gal  
That gal I'd left behind me  
She wrote ahead to a place I said  
And I was glad to find it  
She says "I'm true, when you get through  
Ride back and you will find me"  
That sweet little gal, that true little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that pretty little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
When we sold out I took the train  
I knew that I would find her  
When I got back, we had a smack  
And that's no gol-darned liar  
That sweet little gal, that true little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that pretty little gal  
The gal I left behind me  


[Chorus]  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want to die  
I just want to ride on my motorcycle  
  
It was late last night the other day  
I thought I'd go up and see Ray  
So l went up and I saw Ray  
There was only one thing Ray could say, was:  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just last week I was on my bike  
I run into a friend named Mike  
Run into my friend named Mike  
Mike no longer has a bike. He cries:

Chorus  
  
This song is about the time that I was ridin' my motorcycle.  
Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin'  
My guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a  
Mountain, and on the other side there was nothin' - there was  
A cliff in the air.  
  
Now, when you're going down a mountain road at I50 miles  
An hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you're playin'  
A guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar.  
Because if it's an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater  
On the box side than on the neck side, because there's  
More guitar on the box side. I wasn't payin' attention..  
  
Luckily I didn't go into the mountain - I went over the cliff.  
I was goin' at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down  
At the same time.  
  
I knew it was the end. I looked down, I said ''Wow! Some  
Trip". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last  
Trip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided  
To write one last farewell song to the world.  
  
Put a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper.  
I sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin':  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorsickle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle  
  
And I don't want to die  
Just want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. "  
  
I knew that, it wasn't the best song l ever wrote, but I didn't  
Have time to change it. I was comin' down mighty fast.  
  
But as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn't die. I  
Landed on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away  
On the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin'  
175 miles an hour, playin' the motorcycle song.  
  
I came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around  
The corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned  
Itself off.  
  
I walked over to my friend. He was standin' there eatin'  
Pickles. I said "Hi, what's happenin'?" He looked at me in the  
Eye and said "Nothin'".  
  
You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just  
Squashed a cop...  
  
Chorus


This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American  
Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys  
In the FBI.  
  
Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first  
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.  
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the  
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just  
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your  
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a  
Meaningful shape in today's complex society.  
  
But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I  
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have  
To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job.  
Follow me around.  
  
I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I  
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They  
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you  
Know.  
  
I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether  
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't  
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.  
  
Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12  
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that  
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane  
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the  
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats  
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that  
You have to go.  
  
Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't  
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna  
Do?  
  
Well, it's a drag for him. But that


As I walked out in the streets of Laredo  
As I walked out in Laredo one day  
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen  
All wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay  
  
""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""  
These words he did say as I proudly stepped by  
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story  
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die  
  
""'Twas once in the saddle I used to go ridin'  
Once in the saddle I used to go gay  
First lead to drinkin', and then to card-playing  
I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today  
  
""Let six jolly cowboys come carry my coffin  
Let six pretty gals come to carry my pall  
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin  
Throw roses to deaden the clods as they fall  
  
""Oh, beat the drum slowly, and play the fife lowly  
And play the dead march as you carry me along  
Take me to the green valley and lay the earth o'er me  
For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong""  
  
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly  
And bitterly wept as we carried him along  
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome  
We all loved our comrade although he done wrong


Words and music by Woody Guthrie  
  
Chorus:  
This land is your land, this land is my land  
From California, to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
As I was walking a ribbon of highway  
I saw above me an endless skyway  
I saw below me a golden valley  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts  
And all around me a voice was sounding  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
The sun comes shining as I was strolling  
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling  
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there  
And that sign said - no tress passin'  
But on the other side.... It didn't say nothin!  
Now that side was made for you and me!  
  
Chorus  
  
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple  
Near the relief office - I see my people  
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'  
If this land's still made for you and me.  
  
Chorus (2x)


There's gonna be some changin' 'round  
Babe, when you come turn me down  
Trifled on me for your last time  
When I come home at night  
Why you always start a fight?  
Now, babe I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some dough  
When you gotta go, you gotta go  
Gonna leave you and ease  
This troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
Now baby I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some sense  
Gonna leave you to ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  


I saw the splendor of the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
There's something tender in the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
  
And all the beaches are filled with peaches  
Who bring their ukes along  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song  
  
1:  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
If you like to linger where it's shady  
Ukulele Lady linger too  
If you kiss Ukulele Lady  
While you promise ever to be true  
And she sees another Ukulele  
Lady foolin' 'round with you  
  
2:  
Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)  
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)  
Maybe she'll find somebody else  
By and by  
To sing to when it's cool and shady  
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
  
She used to sing to me by moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight  
Although I'm far away  
  
Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing  
And lips are made to kiss  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the song I miss


Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home  
And I backed him on the banjo so he didn't play alone  
We've got five generations of a fiddle playin' clan  
And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man  
  
Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie  
Written on the road by the light of the moon  
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan  
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon  
  
Well, my daddy had a fiddle, and he laid it on his son  
Sayin', "Son, play the fiddle like your fiddlin' folks done."  
Well, it's hard to learn to fiddle  
When you're fiddlin' on the run  
But fiddlin' is fiddlin', and fiddlin' is fun


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Truth is you've been waiting so long  
You're ripe and so insane  
Can the tentacles of your mind stop the pain  
  
How long will you sit there wondering  
What's happening to your heart  
Can't you fell the love surround you - That's a start  
  
Chorus:  
I'll take to the road in a little while  
Under cover of night  
You come or you stay  
Whatever seems right  
  
I ain't looking for friends or lovers  
Ain't looking for a pot of gold  
Had it all when I was younger - It got old  
  
Who will leave this world of sorrow  
Who will die to all the fears  
Kowning I'll be gone tommorow - Gone for years  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere the sun's just rising  
And the road comes in to view  
There's a wanderer freed from dying - Could be you  
  
Who will pay the price for freedom  
Learn the disciplines of the road  
Many tried but few succeed - So I'm told


Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Now there's a new craze a-goin' 'round  
It's gettin' bigger in most every town  
From New York City out to Hollywood  
Got everybody in the neighborhood  
CHORUS:  
Down in the unemployment line  
You got yourself a place and I got mine  
We been here waitin' since the clock struck nine  
Down in the unemployment line  
Now every day you've got to fight the horde  
Just to read what's on the bulletin board  
When you go back and try and claim your space  
Some other sucker come and stole your place  
CHORUS  
I hope the people in the government  
Tell us how we're gonna pay the rent  
How we're gonna get enough to eat  
No that the workin' man is obsolete  
If things keep goin' like they seem they do  
Won't be long before they're down here too  
And they can be a part of this here mob  
Workin' nine to five to find a job  
CHORUS  
  


Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
In a grave without a headstone  
Without a date or name  
My partner lies there silent  
In the land from which I came  
Long ago we rode together  
We'd ridden side by side  
I loved him like a brother  
And I wept when Utah died  
While riding up one morning  
And our work was almost done  
The cattle quickly started  
On a wild and maddening run  
The boss's little daughter  
Who was riding on that side  
Rushed in to stop the stampede  
It was there my partner died  
Lenore upon her pony  
Tried to turn the cattle right  
But her blanket slipped beneath her  
And she caught and held on tight  
When we all saw that red blanket  
Each cowboy held his breath  
For should her pony fail her  
None could save the girl from death  
When the cattle saw the blanket  
Almost dragging on the ground  
They were maddened in a moment  
And they charged with deafening sound  
The girl soon saw her danger  
And she turned her pony's face  
And bending in her saddle  
Tried the blanket to replace  
Just then she lost her balance  
In the front of that wild tide  
Carroll's voice controlled the round up  
"Lie still, Lenore" he cried  
And then close up beside her  
Came Utah riding fast  
But little did the poor boy know  
The ride would be his last  
Full often from the saddle  
He had caught the trailing rope  
To pick her up at full speed  
Was now his only hope  
He swung low from his saddle  
To take her to his arm  
We thought that he'd succeeded  
That the girl was safe from harm  
But such a strain upon his saddle  
Had ne'er been put before  
And the cinches gave beneath him  
And he fell beside Lenore  
When the girl fell from her saddle  
She had dragged the blanket down  
It lay there close beside them  
Where they lay upon the ground  
Utah took the blanket  
And to Lenore he said  
"Lie still" and quickly running  
Waved the red thing o'er his head  
He turned the maddened cattle  
From Lenore, his little friend  
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him  
He turned to met his end  
And as the herd came on him  
His weapon quickly drew  
He was bound to die defended  
As all brave cowboys do  
The weapon flashed like lightning  
And it sounded loud and clear  
As the cattle rushed and killed him  
He dropped the leading steer  
When I broke through that wide circle  
To where poor Utah lay  
With a thousand wounds and bruises  
His life blood ebbed away  
I knelt down close beside him  
And I knew that all was o'er  
As I heard him faintly whisper  
"Good-bye, my sweet Lenore"  
Next morning at the churchyard  
I heard the preacher say  
"Don't think our kind friend Utah  
Was lost on that great day  
He was a much-loved cowboy  
And not afraid to die  
And we'll meet him at the round up  
On the plains beyond the sky"  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
  


Words by Adrian Mitchell, music by Arlo Guthrie  
Victor Jara of Chile  
Lived like a shooting star  
He fought for the people of Chile  
With his songs and his guitar  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor Jara was a peasant  
He worked from a few years old  
He sat upon his father's plow  
And watched the earth unfold  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Now when the neighbors had a wedding  
Or one of their children died  
His mother sang all night for them  
With Victor by her side  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He grew up to be a fighter  
Against the people's wrongs  
He listened to their grief and joy  
And turned them into songs  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He sang about the copper miners  
And those who worked the land  
He sang about the factory workers  
And they knew he was their man  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He campaigned for Allende  
Working night and day  
He sang "Take hold of your brothers hand  
You know the future begins today"  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Then the generals seized Chile  
They arrested Victor then  
They caged him in a stadium  
With five-thousand frightened men  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor stood in the stadium  
His voice was brave and strong  
And he sang for his fellow prisoners  
Till the guards cut short his song  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
They broke the bones in both his hands  
They beat him on the head  
They tore him with electric shocks  
And then they shot him dead  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Repeat first verse  
  


[CHORUS:]  
Rolling, wheeling like I'm feeling  
Everything's gonna carry on  
You go your way, I'm going my way  
We will come and so be gone  
  
Wheel of fortune, turn for me now  
Turn to trouble in the West  
Wheels of completion rolling  
Wait to put my mind to rest  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Hey, Ezekiel, you can leave now  
You got to go or stay so long  
While your wheels just keep turning  
Turn to rhythm right and wrong  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Wheel of fortune, turn for me now  
Turn to trouble in the West  
Wheels of completion rolling  
Wait to put my mind at rest


Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier packs his memories  
As he leaves Afghanistan  
And back home, they don't know too much  
There's just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there won't be any victory parades  
For those that's coming back  
They'll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
They'll say it wasn't easy  
Just another job, well done  
As the government in Kabul falls  
To the sounds of rebel guns  
And the faces of the comrades  
Being blown out of the sky  
Leaves you bitter with the feeling  
That they didn't have to die  
And there won't be any victory parades  
For those that's coming back  
They'll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier unpacks memories  
That he saved from Vietnam  
Back home they didn't know too much  
There was just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there wasn't any big parades  
For those that made it back  
They flew them in at midnight  
And unloaded all the sacks  
And the living were left walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seemed to care back then  
When a soldier made it home  
The night is coming quickly  
And the stars are on their way  
As I stare into the evening  
Looking for the words to say  
That I saw the lonely soldier  
Just a boy that's far from home  
And I saw that I was just like him  
While upon this earth I roam  
And there may not be any big parades  
If I ever make it back  
As I come home under cover  
Through a world that can't keep track  
Of the heroes who have fallen  
Let alone the ones who won't  
Which is why nobody seems to care  
When a soldier makes it home  


Words and music by Jimmy Rodgers  
Cattle prowl and the coyotes howl  
Out on the Great Divide  
Never done no wrong, just singin' a song  
As down the trail I ride  
Rattle snakes rattle at the prairie dogs  
You can hear that mournful tune  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel...  
CHORUS  
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell  
They call out every man  
Throw my saddle on my old cow horse  
I drink my coffee from a can  
The sun goes down on the cattle trail  
And I'm gazin' at the moon  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel . . .  
Now we don't have cold weather  
It never snows or rains  
This is where the sun shines best  
Out on the western plains  
Some of the boys are gone away  
But they will be back soon  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel...  
CHORUS  
  


Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop  
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'  
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the sea will split and the ships will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shakin?  
And the tide will pound and the wind will sound  
And the mornin? will be a breakin?  
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls, they'll be a smilin?  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as they're spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin'  
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin'  
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'  
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then they'll raise their hands sayin', we'll meet all your demands  
But we'll shout from the bow, your days are numbered  
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned there in the tide  
And like Goliath they'll be conquered  


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
The sun is sinking down  
I'm standing 'round my window  
You say you're going away  
But I believe in love  
CHORUS:  
The power of love divine  
Will surely shine you'll see  
And guide us to where we ought to be  
You and me  
The moon is coming up  
And I'm still here in prayer  
You say you've had enough  
And that you just don't care  
CHORUS  
But while the stars are coming out  
And light shines from above  
You tell me in my dreams  
That you believe in love  
CHORUS  
The sun is coming up  
A rainbow on my window  
You say you're going away  
And even though you do  
The power of love divine  
Will surely shine you'll see  
And guide you home again to be...  
You and me  
  
  


Baby I wanna tell you all my hopes and dreams and fears  
But I'm watching television, could you get me another beer  
There's wrestling and pro football on, I hope you understand  
I must watch it all for I am a man  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he perspires  
'Til the stains show on his shirt  
I missed our anniverary and the birth of our son  
It was beyond my control, my team was on a playoff run  
Oh baby, baby, baby, you mean everything to me  
But could you move your butt, you're blocking the TV?  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he does tire  
Gets sleepy and naps on the couch  
Oh baby, oh honey, oh darling, oh pudding, what are you doing with that
suitcase? Leaving me? What do you mean we don't communicate? We're talking all
the time. We're talk about-- Ooh! Monster trucks! That little Volkswagon ain't
got no chance against The Cowcrusher! c'mon Cowcrusher, crush that little
Volks-- you're gone. I hope she left me one of them pudding pops. They're
tasty.  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And he shops at Canadian Tire  
And he always keeps his coupons  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he expires  
And he cried when Wayne Gretzky retired  
  


I used to talk about politics, politics, politics,  
I used to talk about politics but I don't anymore.  
I used to talk about communism, socialism, capitalism  
I used to talk about all those isms but now I'm a dad  
And all I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
I used to rant about traffic problems,  
Fender benders, stupid signs  
I used to fear an accident  
But now I stay at home  
And talk about:  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it's all brown and gooey  
Sometimes it looks like dijon mustard  
Sometimes it's like melted crayon  
Sometimes it just smells like POO  
  
I used to talk about philosophy,  
Kafka, Descartes, Socrates  
I used to think metaphysically  
But now I think the world evolves around:  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it feels just like stucco  
Sometimes it feels like Jell-o pudding  
Sometimes it's like avocado  
Sometimes she just pees on me  
  
I used to be real int'resting  
Discussing issues of the day  
But now I call up my MP  
And tell her all about my baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo

I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
A killer of the ocean,  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
And silently I strike.  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I'm dumber than a tree,  
I only have three thoughts and they are: eat, swim, ... Eat.  
  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
I was swimming in the ocean,  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
I got picked up by a boat.  
A team of lonely fishermen sold me to a park,  
And now my name is Billy, I'm a Theme Park Shark.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head.  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed.  
  
The sight of blood once put me in a frenzy,  
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool...  
  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I'm swimming in a pool,  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I don't have to fight for food,  
I get three meals a day, and some extra on the weekend  
And I'm the only shark I know who has a dental plan.  
Who has a dental plan.  
  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
And I'm a big attraction.  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
They love to watch me jump,  
I've been the star for years and I've never been for sale,  
At least until the owners think they need a killer whale.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
Jumping out football nets suspended overhead,  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed.  
  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
But I'm not in my natural habitat,  
He's fat and old and lazy,  
But I'm happy you're here.  
I really hope these activists don't free Billy,  
'cause out there in the wild, I'd be dead.  
  
The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy,  
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head,  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
  
He looks just like a killer, in the wild, he'd be dead.  
  
Oh, Billy, (Billy) Billy, (Billy)  
The number one attraction of an aqua petting zoo.  
Billy, (Billy) Billy, (Billy)  
The poster fish of tourism Iowa!


There are many wonders in the usa  
The cities and the people, and Disney World, hooray!  
But coming back to Canada with joy the heart does ooze  
'Cause when you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
I was traveling with a gentleman who didn't like to drink  
When we got to the border, I commenced to think  
I said, "Do me a favour" and he did not refuse  
When we got to the border, he bought me a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You may be in a comedy act, touring through the 'States  
You're playing hard in country bars, things aren't going great  
A fight breaks out at the pool table, you run before you bruise  
But you call the tour successful and buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
Ok, the sad verse now, the sad verse:  
A friend of mine came to me, his face awash in tears  
For he could afford the spirit that gave him cheers (aww)  
I said, "Aw! Stop yer cryin'! I'll wash away those blues...  
When I was at the border, I bought ya a bottle of booze! "  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
Hey!


You know something girl? I'm thinking about you right now.  
You don't want to know what I'm thinking, girl.  
Or... or do you?  
Girl, you think I'm the bomb,  
But I'm old enough to be dating your mom. And I did.  
She wasn't that bad, but you're grounded if you tell your dad  
That you like the way we dance, with rock-hard abs and plastic pants.  
You give us teddy bears,  
And in return we shave our chest hairs. Yeah, we're so manly.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.  
Never see a dime for selling out to the man.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
We say we met in church, but we're a product to market research.  
We sing about sex, to little girls who shouldn't think about sex yet.  
It's not like they listen, it's not like they care.  
'Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten.  
We like the color blue. (blue, blue)  
And we're appearing at a mall near you, right beside the food court.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.  
No one likes us here, but we're big in Japan.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Throw your hands up in the air,  
And wave them around like you just don't care.  
You just don't care, you just don't care,  
Now bring your hands down from the air.  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot ahh ahh ahh ahh.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid and the music's bland.  
Another pollutant in the pop wasteland.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
  


Listen up brothers and sisters come hear my desperate tale  
I speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like a jail  
Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night  
This killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight  
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime  
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just cause a radish can't scream  
  
[Chorus]  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (having their insides revealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)  
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell)  
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade is a spade)  
  
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue  
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two  
I'm a political prisoner, trapped in a windowless cage  
Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a rage  
I told the judge when he sentenced me, "This is my finest hour,  
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower"  
  
[Chorus]  
How low as people do we dare to stoop,  
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup?  
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes  
Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato!  
Oh spare the spud! Eat a cow instead!  
  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir-fry are sealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob)  
How do you think that feels? (leave them out in the field)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes, your composts are graves)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (take up macrame)  
Let's call a spade a spade  
(is a spade, is a spade, is a spade, is a spade......)  
  
Power to the peas! Give peas a chance!  
all we are saying, is give peas a chance


I think I've got a crush on Celine Dion  
The way she beats her chest when she sings a love song  
There's something about her makes me want to feed her  
And I'd love to be Mister Celine Dion  
She'll sing a song in English, and she'll sing en francais  
Both the songs will suck, but I love her anyway  
She's full of emotion, I'm full of devotion  
For Celine and I'll be hers someday  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
I sent you cards and letters, but you don't respond  
You play hard to get, but my heart goes on and on (and on and on, etc...)  
I just wanna say, je aimerez  
And I can see your house from my van  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
Celine Celine  
Her skin's so soft and clean  
Just like porcelain  
I wish she'd slather me  
With a tub of Vaseline  
(That was a little creepy) I'm sorry, Celine  
Celine Celine  
Celine Dion  
  


Christmas is here, where did the time go?  
Got to load up the reindeer, put on my red suit and go  
I use to like Christmas, but every year it gets worse  
Getting gift to six billion people is just too much damn work  
Got the Christmas blues, man this job is killing me  
And most of these stupid new houses don't even have chimneys  
I use to be jolly, now I'm depressed  
Had a twinkle in my eye, now I've got a bullet proof vest  
'cause if the pace don't kill me, some gun totting yahoo will  
They keep shooting at me like I'm some sort of big fat red criminal  
Got the Christmas blues, I'm starting to see  
That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies  
I've grown to hate kids, especially their mail  
Always asking me for stuff, well guess what I don't care, oh  
Maybe I'm getting cranky as I get old  
'cause I feel like giving them all a big lump of coal  
Got the Christmas blues, man, enough is enough  
Next year you can find some other sucker to deliver this stuff  
Got the Christmas blues, I tell you I'm gonna quit  
And find me a steady job with good benefits


The holidays are over, you've gained twenty pounds  
The cat's choking on tinsel, pine needles stalk the ground  
There are no cards in the mailbox, just a stack of bills  
Yes, the holidays are over and you are feeling ill  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
It's the most miserable time of the year  
The eggnog's made you fat, the party is over  
'Cept for your wacky Uncle who is still drinking your beer  
Turkey's great on Christmas bur after a whole month  
Of turkey pie stew and pie you start to dread lunch  
Breakfast is much scarier 'cause all there is to eat  
Is fourteen Christmas cakes and a bag of cranberries  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
It's the most miserable time of the year  
Your uncle's in the bathroom and granny's on the sofa  
And you start to wish that they'd just disappear  
You ate too many liquor-filled chocolates  
Got no money left in your pockets  
But at least you got lots of  
Ugly sweaters and bow ties and socks  
(And twenty-two calenders!)  
You're skin is pale and pasty, your energy is spent  
Along with all the money you need to pay the rent  
The children are all crying 'cause they've broken all their toys  
Is this misery worth one day of joy?  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
It's the most miserable time of the year  
Your uncle has passed out on granny on the sofa  
And you start to wish that you could disappear  
And you start to wish that you cold disappear  


It's Christmas in Ignace  
Mommy's got a rock  
She'll give it to Daddy  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Daddy's got a rock  
He'll give it to Mommy  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's a jolly time (here in Ignace)  
As we decorate the Christmas Rock  
It's a happy time  
And if the children are good they'll get toys to play with  
Like rocks  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Bob's got a rock  
But he's gonna keep it  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Jill's got a rock  
She gives it to Bob  
Now he's got two  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's a jolly time  
As we sit and watch Rocky 1,2,3,4,5  
It's a happy time  
Except for Malcolm  
His tongue is stuck to the sign that says,  
"Welcome to Ignace"  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
And all through the houses  
Not a creature is stirring  
Except for the rats  
That live here in Ignace  
Under the rocks  
That are played with by children  
And thrown at Malcolm  
Who's still stuck to the sign that says  
"Welcome to Ignace"  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  


One year I got a dog for Christmas  
And I gave it to the boy next door  
Then I gave him my bike and my mom's bank card  
'cause that's what Christmas is for  
I used to give a lot at Christmas  
You might say I gave to much  
Until my family was broke and we had no place to live  
That's why, Christmas Sucks  
I went down to the mall each Christmas  
Had to the Santa what to bring  
A train, a bike, a pony and a great big pile of cash  
And please don't get my sister anything  
But the shopping mall Santa has been drinking  
His nose is red from years of drinking scotch  
He probably won't remember what's on my Christmas list  
This Father Christmas sucks  
Chorus:  
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks  
Getting stuff is much for fun, you gotta look out for number one  
Christmas Sucks  
Christmas became worse as years went by  
It was the most dreaded time of year  
My parents got me clothes that just weren't cool  
When all I want is money to buy beer  
There was a girl at church who I was sweet on  
So in the Christmas play I was the ox  
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus  
Even for our savious Christmas Sucks  
Chorus  
Now that I am thirty-wight years old  
The only things I get are ties and socks  
My kids are never happy with what's under the tree  
Soon they'll understand Christmas Sucks  
Every freakin' year Christmas Sucks  
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks  


Hey kid, why the long face  
Is it 'cause Santa Clause is flying right over your place  
You've been a bad kid all year  
So quit you snivellin' sucker and wipe up them tears  
You don't deserve a damn thing  
You're not even cute and your attitude stinks  
It must suck to be you  
Nobody likes you so what can you do  
You think you got problems kid, you think you got strife  
But come each December do you fear for your life  
I'm your turkey so your troubles are small  
I'm stuffed on your table, I'm a tasty butterball  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
If you got your necked ripped out then you'd have them too  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too  
You sir, you look like heck  
Didn't you get your Christmas bonus cheque  
Or maybe your woman left you  
Ripped your heart right out of your chest and spat on it too  
Is that why you're wreaking of gin  
You look dishevelled and there's drool on your chin  
You thought that this love would laugh  
But she said Merry Christmas baby and she booted your ass  
Well that's tough for you mister, too bad about your ordeal  
How about getting stuffed in the wintertime, see how you feel  
I don't get to yank no bones or make me a wish  
It won't be long til I'm just some scraps on a dish  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
If your butt was stuffed and roasted then you'd have then too  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too  


I once had a dog named Bob  
And Bob's a funny name for a dog  
If you're gonna get a dog, don't name him Bob  
My neighbour's name is also Bob  
And every time I call my dog  
My neighbour Bob shows up without my dog  
  
Hey, Bob, not you, Bob  
I'm looking for my dog  
Have you seen my dog named Bob?  
My dog named Bob  
  
Bob the dog drank antifreeze  
I got a new dog named Jeez  
So I could yell "Oh Jeez!" just when I please  
And when Jehovah's Witnesses  
  
Come to my house in Saturdays  
I ask them if they'd like to witness Jeez  
Holy Jeez, they fell on their knees  
They beg me, "Please, can we meet Jeez, pretty please?"  
Oh Holy Jeez  
  
Well those Jehovah's Witnesses  
Called the Humane Society  
They took my Jeez away from me  
And then the Catholic diosces  
Made a big deal out of Jeez  
And now I have to pay to go see Jeez  
  
Hey, Jeez, remember me?  
Remember the beach and playing Frisbee with me?  
For the love of Jeez


George Washington was the president  
But now he's dead (dead)  
Mackenzie King was Prime Minister  
But now he's dead (dead)  
  
So don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Oppenheimer built the bomb  
But now he's dead (dead)  
Einstien was very very smart  
But not enough not to be dead (dead)  
  
So don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
And don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, Brian Jones, Keith Moon,  
Jim Morrison, Roy Orbison,  
John Lennon, Bob Marley, Leonard Bernstien, Elvis Presley  
Well, we're not too sure about Elvis  
But I think you get the point  
  
Don't go into music  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into music  
You'll end up dead  
And don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Break it down  
You'll be burned, you'll be fried  
You'll be buried alive  
And there's no hope thinkin'  
That you're gonna survive  
'Cause there's the drowning and choking  
And cancer from smoking  
And smothered while sleeping  
And blood will start seeping  
  
So I have found, you'll end up in the ground  
And you'll be dead  
So I have found, you'll end up in the ground  
I wish there was an option instead  
But you'll be dead  
Dead  
Maybe with a bullet in your head  
But you'll be dead  
Dead  
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very dead


Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me...  
I'm startin' to see double, and I just fell of my stool!  
I'm sluring all my words and I'm covered in my own drool!  
I threw up on my girlfriend and we got into a fight.  
Man oh man, what a fargin' great night!  
Well, I wake up the next morning and my brain is full of pain!  
And I swear to god, I will never drink again.  
But, six o'clock rolls around, and there's nothing on T. V.,  
So I call up all my buddies, and they come drink with me! Oh  
Drink with me... Have a drink to you're health  
Then go and throw up on yourself!  
Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Ar!  
Well, after six or seven pints I figured I was hosed,  
So I had another five until the bar was closed.  
I staggered back to my place and I cracked another crate!  
When I woke up at sunset I was wearing what I ate.  
I threw up in the bathroom it's amazing what I saw!  
Peas and corn and bicycle parts and meat that still looked raw!  
I stumbled to the kitchen and I had myself a beer!  
Alchohol, alchohol you are a friend so dear! So!  
Drink with me...  
Drink for England drink for France! Drink until you pee your Pants!  
Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Ar!  
Woke up at six P. M. I needed liquor and a friend!  
So I grabbed a couple bottles and a pig out of it's pen.  
Drank a bottle of tequila, playing stupid drinking games,  
Then, wandered out into the snow and tried to pee our names.  
We staggered to a bar and we ordered up a pint!  
The waiter said he couldn't, he said "We don't serve swine! '  
The pig, he punched the waiter, grabbed the drinks and oinked at him.  
That's no way to talk to my new best friend!  
Drink with me...  
Ninetynine bottles of beer on the wall! Me and the pig'll drink them all!  
Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Ar!


Well me an' my buddies we got us some beer  
And a great big bottle of rye  
And boxes of ammo and guns to go with 'em  
And good old Charlie's glass eye  
Well we looked all around so we sees all of nature  
So calm and so serene  
But not for long 'cause we're gonna use guns  
To make furry animals scream  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well off we go, our guns are loaded  
And so's are we  
We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces  
And piss on the nice trees  
And then we spot something moving an' a rustle  
We pump it full of lead  
And smile real wide as we hear it scream  
And thud as it falls down dead  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well off we go to see what we killed  
And watch the damn thing bleed  
The first thing we see is a bright orange cap  
And we shot down Ol' Charlie  
But he don't to mind, he smiled all the time  
He died real happy  
But next time he should tell us  
When he's goin' off to take a pee  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well the sun goes down and we head back to town  
And we hop in our pickup truck  
Strap Charlie to the hood, start up the engine  
Drive it home with any luck  
Well what do you know, we run into a pole  
But we're all still in one piece  
And we get a free ride back into town  
Courtesy of the police.  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!


It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
The only light we ever see is from our moniter  
We argue about comic books and Internet connections  
The biggest highlight of the year is the Star Trek Convention  
Our town's not big enough to sign up any stars  
But we once met a red shirt who was phasered by a Borg  
(Man, he knew Mr. Sulu!) (What?)  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We wear our Star Trek uniforms and talk like Captain Kirk  
We have our own heroes who we try to emulate  
I dream of one day being as sexy as Bill Gates  
We hate watching sports 'cause we're reading Carl Sagan  
But we'd watch the Olympics if they played Dungeons and Dragons  
(I'm a Hobbitt! Ha ha ha ha!)  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We think Tolkein was a genius and Shakespeare was a turd  
We rarely get a date or get talked to by a girl  
Unless they're having trouble with their algebra homework  
We're emotionally bereft and we're sexually frustrated  
But we can download photographs of Agent Scully naked  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We know the truth is out there but we'd have to leave our room  
We are the nerds in your neighbourhood  
Polyester's a fashion statement  
But there's more room on the beach for you  
'Cause we're locked in our basement  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We like to wear colours that do not appear in nature  
It's great to be a  
Poorly-dressed fashionless  
Star trekking roleplaying  
Ninety pound when wet down  
Pasty skinned pop drinking  
Underfed genius  
Yes, it's great to be a nerd  
  


I love you so much I need the Heimlich Maneuver  
  
The sun goes down on another day  
A day where I haven't found love  
I try to eat, but all I taste  
Is the flavor of a broken heart  
Then I saw you across the room  
I gasp and my breathing stops  
My heart's in my throat, or is it a potato?  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
My love is consumating, while I'm asphyxiating  
Over her  
  
When I wake up, I'm on the floor  
Faint, dizzy and alone  
My stomach hurts, I think my ribs are cracked  
Not sure if I'm in a dream  
I turn my head, and there you are  
I call out and my breathing stops  
It's her again, crushing my esophagus  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation  
Mouth to mouth  
  
She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek  
Helps me back on my stool  
She's a waitress here, but in the night  
She's a student at nursing school  
She comes again with a smile and the bill  
I pick it up and choke again  
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
For my lasting endurance, I'll need medical insurance  
For my bill  
For me to get some peace, I'll need a tracheotomy  
And an airbag


Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica.  
Columbus made history thinking some island was India.  
General Custer's a national hero for not knowing when to run.  
All these men are famous, and they're also very dumb.  
  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
  
Nobility are famous for no reason.  
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake.  
She cause a Revolution when she would not share.  
And her husband lost his head for that mistake.  
  
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin.  
Her makers made a minor oversight.  
Before they filled it up with explosive gas  
They should have fixed the no smoking light.  
  
'Cause!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
Our king and country's honor we will save.  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
We're marching into history and the grave.  
  
So, if your son or daughter seem too lazy,  
Sitting there watching mad T. V.  
Just remember you should be quite grateful  
At least they're not making history.  
  
Ahhh!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
Do something dumb before you die  
Do something dumb before you die!!


I am cow hear me moo  
I weigh twice as much as you  
And I look good on the barbecue  
Yogurt, curd, cream cheese, and butter's  
made from liquid from my udders  
I am cow, I am cow, hear me moo!  
  
I am cow, eating grass  
methane gas comes out my ass  
and out my muzzle when I belch  
o the ozone layer is thinner  
from the outcome of my dinner  
I am cow, I am cow, I've got gas  
  
I am cow, here I stand  
far and wide upon this land  
and I am living everywhere  
from B.C. to Newfoundland  
You can squeeze my teats by hand  
I am cow, I am cow, I am cow  
I am cow, I am cow, I am cow!


I pulled my groin  
It's the very best injury  
Though I'm walking daintily  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
When people ask, "It hurts you where?"  
I say "Put your hand right there"  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
Though I do not enjoy walking  
I am really happy talking  
'bout my groin  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
It's the treatment that I love  
Because I've bought some oil to rub  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
Unless we're in playoff time  
When I've got a lower body injury that  
Will have to be a game time decision  
I pulled my groin  
It hurts me when I skate  
But not when I master.. Hills  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin


If you haven't heard of me  
I wouldn't be surprised  
I bet you know my relatives  
Their names will never die  
My mother is a saint  
And my brother is a god  
But all I am is Jesus' brother Bob  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
I have to pay the ferry  
To cross the Galilee  
But not my brother  
No not him  
He walks across for free  
I finally get to work  
'Bout a quarter after nine  
Already he's turning water into wine  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
One day when I was home  
I heard a mighty r oar  
There were a thousand people  
Right outside the door  
Help us, Jesus, help us!  
Came the cheering from the mob  
But then they got a look at me  
Oh nuts, it's only Bob  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
He died upon the cross  
I thought that I was free  
Finally people would get to know  
Me for me  
(Hi Bob, Hi Judas!)  
This was my big chance  
To finally get ahead  
The next thing you know  
He's rising from the dead  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
Everybody!  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
ahhhahhhhahhh-Bob


I once was a happy man of sound and stable mind  
Then my neighbour bought a dog  
He put a ribbon on it's head to make it cute  
But it still looked like a chihuahua  
He had me over to watch it sit and beg  
It bit my knee, and made love to my leg  
Now it barks all the night and all of the day  
Whenever it's not peeing on my lawn  
I didn't get to sleep last night till very late  
The stupid dog barked and grrrr'd  
I got up late for work and ran to catch the bus  
But I slipped on a turd  
I was certain it wasn't one of mine  
That that dog had crossed over the line  
I wanted to exterminate it and all it's kind  
From my lovely little suburb  
I'm gonna kill the dog next door  
Ain't gonna bark anymore  
'Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
I see the little monster in my garden  
So I grab an axe and off I go  
And I try my best to get it  
All I do is sever my big toe  
My neighbour comes outside to call me  
He says his dog and me should just be friends  
He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands  
Then it starts to bite  
So I strangle it with all my might  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
I'm gonna kill the dog next door (kill the dog next door)  
Ain't gonna bark anymore  
'Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
Now the stupid mutt's in doggy heaven  
I strangled it to death and now I'm free  
But my trouble ain't quite over  
My neighbour called the cops on me  
I end up at the police station  
Where I am told that I must pay  
A 300 dollar fine  
Wow, what a good value  
I think I'll kill my neighbour too!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
I'm gonna kill the guy next door (kill the guy next door)  
Won't call the cops anymore  
I never liked him anyway  
300 isn't much to pay  
There are turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)  
They must be his, his dog is gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that guy!

Billy solves his problems by calling up his mom  
Heather solves her problems with drugs and Alcohol  
Daniel solves his problems with a doctor and the law  
But Malcolm has his own way and it's better than them all  
CHORUS  
'Cause Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw  
And he never has the same problem twice  
Whether it's a bill or a cheque arriving late  
Rancid marble cheese or a steak that's second rate  
Awful TV programs or a broken ELvis plate  
Or his fiancee who dumps him because he's gaining weight  
CHORUS  
Aaaaggghhh Aaaaggghhh  
Problem solved  


Me work hard 5 days a week  
Sweeping garbage from the street  
Come home not want book to read  
Not 'nuff pictures for me see  
Sit right down in favourite chair  
Wearing only underwear  
Favourite night is Saturday night  
'Cause me can watch hockey fights  
Me Like Hockey!  
Me not like pro basketball  
'Cause me short and they all tall  
Baseball slow like Forrest Gump  
'Cept when Robby spits on ump  
Wrestlemania not so great  
Me like to see Hulk Hogan skate  
TV soccer not so hot  
You play bad then you get shot  
Me Like Hockey!  
Swedish players must be geeks  
'Cause they still got own real teeth  
Not like Finnish players names  
What's a Teemu anyways?  
Russians worse in history  
Got stupid names like Valery  
Me like Sergei Federov  
Me like him more if head were off  
ha! ha! ha!  
Me Like Hockey!  
Please Mr. Linseman let the players  
fight  
Friends come over put game on  
Argue then we lat bets down  
Got bag of chips and case of Bud  
Should last till end of first period  
But Yankees they win the World Cup  
Me think the cheat use glowy puck!  
Maybe if we want to win her  
Maybe we should play in winter  
Me Like Hockey!


On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail, you'll be sure to see  
All Mother Nature's favourite pets, all sitting rigidly  
They're never hungry any more, their last meal left them stuffed  
Don't worry, they won't walk away if you try and pet their fluff  
  
And the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The Mounted Animal Nature Trail, it's great for Mom and Dad  
Where else can Grandma and the kids see the silence of the lambs?  
Don't have to walk a hundred miles ore climb the steepest hill  
And the only fearsome sound you'll hear is the ringing of the till  
  
And the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The only things that bite are the bugs (Oww..)  
And unlike other theme parks, the mice won't say "Hello"  
And if you're having troubles with your own family pet  
You can bring him and add him to the trail  
  
Everyone, and the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this

Last night when I went to bed  
With tangled hair upon my head  
In every way I really was a kid  
It happened without warning  
When I woke up in the morning  
I can't tell you just what happened but it did  
  
I grew six inches in one day  
It's painful when it goes that way  
And now my skinny body's really achin'  
And my skin just exploded  
With an inch of oil it's loaded  
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
I buy two pairs of jeans a week  
I'm such a tall and awkward geek  
I fall down when I try to play a grounder  
At dinner every night I eat  
A giant heaping plate of meat  
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders  
  
And weird emotions come alive  
My hormones are in overdrive  
I've turned into a girl-watching creature  
And all my friends their marks are shot  
But they don't care because they're hot  
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Pretty soon I bet I'll  
Be right into heavy metal  
But my parents say at least it isn't rap  
I'll start wearing stupid clothes  
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose  
And tell my parents all they like is crap  
  
The first girl that I ever kiss  
Will be the one and who could miss  
Our love forever written in the stars?  
But I don't think our love will last  
Unless the four years go by fast  
Till I can use the backseat of the car  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Cha-cha-cha!


Our love is like a new car smell  
Sooner or later it all goes to hell  
Somebody farts or spills some taco bell  
Our love is like a new car smell  
Our love is like a barbeque ignition  
You know that button you push lights the propane emission  
It works for a month then the spark goes missing  
Our love is like a barbeque ignition  
Our love is like a video game  
That you play alot and then it gets lame  
Then a new one comes out that's better but the same  
Our love is like a video game  
Our love..  
Our love is like a surgical procedure  
It's painful and invasive, your insurance won't cover  
And when it's done you walk funny forever  
Our love is like a surgical procedure  
Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
It has its moments but it's way too long  
Like a bat outta hell it all goes wrong  
Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
Our love is like Keanu Reeves  
Who's made some really bad movies  
That's all time you can't retrieve  
Our love is like Keanu Reeves  
Our love..


Open my eyes, what a beautiful day  
Just the type that makes me want to say hooray  
I'm still a little fuzzy-headed from my sleep  
Into my brain reality seeps  
Look all around me, can't believe what I see  
These little short people are surrounding me  
I've got a white beard, a suit made of red  
My soul becomes filled with a keen sense of dread  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Hop out of bed, kick an elf in the chest  
What an awful way to awake from a rest  
"Santa, oh, Santa," the little gnomes cheer  
"You shouldn't be nasty at this time of year!"  
"What do you mean?" I say in a rage  
"And what are you doing with those big burlap bags?"  
The elves they do roar, "Why their full of toys  
For you to deliver to the good girls and boys. "  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Resigned to my fate, I load up the sleigh  
Harness the reindeer and get under way  
It's nippy up here in the cool arctic sky  
Good thing I remembered that bottle of rye  
Flying over rooftops, throwing out toys  
Hopefully crushing those good girls and boys  
Like a bad dream, I pray for release  
Please let this hellish existence be ceased!  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
From this nightmare I finally awake  
My brain is on fire, my hands they do shake  
But wait, they're not hands, they're cute little paws  
I'm the Easter Bunny, I'm not Santa Claus!  
  
Oh God, I'm the Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I 'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny


Well my baby came at me with a 2x4  
So I fought her off with sandpaper  
It was 60 grit, it was really rough  
And it made a lot of sawdust  
But we patched things up with love and glue  
We went to the church and said "I do"  
Our honeymoon was at a hardware store  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Well I heard the train come rolling by  
With cattle on board, so we decided  
We should drop everything and hop that train  
And take a one-way trip to the slaughterhouse  
Well we stared at the cattle as they took the walk  
To meet the man who worked the saw  
We stared at the blood and the guts and the gore  
It looked an awful lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
We made love on a flat bed truck  
She worried about getting splinters in her butt  
I said don't think about those problems when we rut  
The deck's made of particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle board, you could make a dresser  
Or a shelf or a hutch or an ottoman  
You could leave it like it is or paint it up  
It's still gonna be made of particle board  
Particle board, it's useful stuff  
It's stronger than glue, it's better than fluff  
It sounds like a simile and that's enough  
To say that our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle Board!


I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to play with other people's money  
  
I'm having a lousy day  
I burned my toast and spilled my coffee  
On my best shirt. So I had to change and then  
I'm late for work. So I rush into the meeting  
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is  
And I don't really give a damn  
But I don't have another job  
And so I lie and say  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to talk to stimulating people  
  
I open up my mail  
Hoping that it's not a bill but it's from the bank  
Saying that I have only 20 hours to go  
To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year  
So I run down to the bank but there's a 20-mile lineup  
And I'm yelling and I'm screaming  
And I'm not wearing any pants ah ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to screw with other people's lives  
  
I took out 40 bucks  
From the automatic teller. It told me  
That I couldn't 'cause I just had 10  
But that can't be 'cause I just got paid on Friday  
So I go down to the bank, wait an hour in the lineup  
And I'm talking to the teller  
She says "Wait I'll get your last month's statement"  
She comes back in 7 hours  
Says I've got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill  
That bounced and so they'll have to charge me 40 bucks for that  
And for the box I never opened and I don't have overdraft protection  
And I think I'll die before I pay off all that I owe and I don't even  
Own a car  
  
I'm pleased to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm pleased to be a banker  
'Cause I get to play with other people's money  
  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
Would you please endorse this cheque?  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
Do you have any assets?  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
You should buy you shouldn't rent  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
The cheque will cost you fifty cents  
(IT WILL COST YOU FIFTY CENTS)  
(He's a banker and he says  
That it will cost you fifty cents  
He's a banker and he says  
That it will cost you fifty cents)  
(IT WILL COST YOU FIFTY CENTS)


Our fair country Canada  
Is north of the USA  
Our maritimes are lovely  
And our prairies give us hay  
You might think you Yankees are better than us Canucks  
But we don't need no microchips inside our hockey pucks  
  
We know that you've got Disney World  
And you keep it very clean  
We don't have Bob Dole  
But we can drink when we're 19  
We even watch your TV shows for hours and hours and hours  
We'll give you Alan Thicke but Shania Twain is ours  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Your beer is not too tasty  
And you weather can't be beat  
We all fly south in the winter time  
To escape the snow and sleet  
We're pleased to say we've enjoyed all your southern charms  
But we get sun burnt when we exercise our right to bear our arms  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Alanis Morrissette  
She is our latest pride and joy  
She used to sing about high school dances  
And chancing after boys  
But now she is fed up and about as angry as can be  
She's got one hand in her pocket and the other is on guard for thee  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
We're proud to be Canadian

We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Tears are not enough!


It's the most frightening thing in the world  
It's the scariest sight I've ever seen  
The most chilling visual  
The most terrifying scene  
It's awful, it's crappy, it's monstrous, it's bad  
It's really really huge  
It's a fat man in a Speedo  
I'm walking on a beach in a tropical isle  
Hoping to enjoy the sand and surf  
When I see a mound of baby-oiled flesh  
Rolling and a broiling in the foam  
The only thing that's holding this  
Explosion of Caucasian is  
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread  
I try to sink it in the sand  
And entomb it in a castle but  
It always manages to break free  
The fat man in a Speedo  
I'm having nightmares  
I'm scared to open my eyes  
I try to free myself  
By going to the buffet  
But there he is  
He even eats in his Speedo  
I take up a collection at the bar the next day  
And everybody gives to the cause  
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale  
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk  
We have a celebration  
In one of his indentations  
And throw a bowl of jello in the air  
We think we've escaped and our scenery is clear  
But in comes a plane from Germany  
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos!


Special guest vocalist, Mike's dad: Bob McCormick  
(Mike's dad appears courtesy of Mike's mom)  
There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes
and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was
built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the
railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men
among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man
who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength
of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm
gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man
as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the
ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick.  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes  
Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night  
Or if his bones weren't feeling right  
Or if it looked like it was going to rain  
He had a tendency of being late for work  
And everyone around thought he was a jerk  
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt  
Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan

Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike!  
Mike: What, what is it?  
Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work.  
Mike: Awww, already?  
Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes?  
Mike: No.  
Mike's dad: Oh.  
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws  
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft  
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough  
Then go home and take a little nap  
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son  
He just hung around and bothered everyone  
Never drove a spike, not a single one  
Though now and then he'd give a tap  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE!  
Mike: What? What is it?  
Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails
faster than any man alive.  
Mike: Sounds like a good idea.  
Mike's dad: No! No! No!  
Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster.  
Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs.
You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong!  
Mike: Okay.  
So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!)  
He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!)  
He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!)  
Then he got crushed by a meteor and died  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man (steel drivin' maaaan)  
  


I'm out on the range, surveying the land  
Thinking of the job that's to be done  
My life is hard but I don't mind  
Men like me, that's how the west was won  
I stand the pain and the suffering  
For on the trail I am the king  
On doors I knock and on bells I ring  
Always sure that I will get the sale  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
The door swings wide and I sense my prey  
Ready to fall victim to my pitch  
I tell him all about the plan  
With all of its inherent benefits  
If you lose an arm it's a thousand bucks  
Lose both of them and get twice as much  
And if you should die, well then, bless your luck  
You'll just be raking in the cash  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
The sucker signs, the deed is done  
It's time for me to get back on the road  
A lonely man out on the land  
Where the wind can blow so cold  
I ride into the setting sun  
With the knowledge of a job well done  
But I can't rest until everyone  
Has become properly insured  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
Yes, I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
For on the dotted line I make them sign


Gonna go out and play some golf ya, ya  
Gonna go out and play some golf  
My golf bag's full of the latest stuff  
I'm gonna go out and play some golf  
My putter alone was a thousand bucks  
I'm gonna go out and suck at golf  
Think I better take a muligan ya, ya  
Think I better take a mulligan  
I put my ball in the pond again  
I think I better take a mulligan  
I tee it up and take a swing and then splash  
Can I get another mulligan?  
Get up get up get up get up get up  
A get down get down,  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down! Slow down  
Don't hit the tree don't hit the tree

There must be something wrong with my clubs  
All my friends hit it farther than me  
Ya all my friends hit it farther than me  
I just hope I clear the ladies tee  
Everyobody hits it farther than me  
Just 8 more strokes then I reach a par 3  
That kid just hit it farther than me  
Get up get up get up get up get up  
A get down, get down  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down ball, slow down down down  
Don't hit the tree don't hit the tree  
Please hit the tree

Never be as good as Tiger Woods no no  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
My balls always goin off into the woods  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
I'm hookin' my arms and I'm pullin my woods (What?)  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
Get up get up get up get up get up  
A get down get down,  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down! Slow down  
Don't hit the tree don't hit the tree  
Hit the tree hit the tree  
I really hate this stupid game


Once a year we celebrate  
With stupid hats and plastic plates  
The fact that you were able to make  
Another trip around the sun  
  
And the whole clan gathers round  
And gifts and laughter do abound  
And we let out a joyful sound  
And sing that stupid song  
  
Happy birthday!  
Now you're one year older!  
Happy birthday!  
Your life still isn't over!  
Happy birthday!  
You did not accomplish much  
But you didn't die this year  
I guess that's good enough  
  
So let's drink to your fading health  
And hope you don't remind yourself  
The chance of finding fame and wealth  
Decrease with every year  
  
Does it feel like you're doing laps  
And eating food and taking naps  
And hoping that someday perhaps  
Your life will hold some cheer  
  
Happy birthday!  
What have you done that matters?  
Happy birthday!  
You're starting to get fatter  
Happy birthday!  
It's downhill from now on  
Try not to remind yourself  
Your best years are all gone  
  
If cryogenics were all free  
Then you could live like Walt Disney  
And live for all eternity  
Inside a block of ice  
  
But instead your time is set  
This is the only life you get  
And though it hasn't ended yet  
Sometimes you wish it might  
  
Happy birthday!  
You wish you had more money  
Happy birthday!  
Your life's so sad it's funny  
Happy birthday!  
How much more can you take?  
But your friends are hungry  
So just cut the stupid cake  
  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday, dear...


If you believe in Darwin's theory  
I'm not saying you have to but it's an interesting theory  
Darwin said we all evolve from monkeys  
If his theory is accurate and who am I to say?  
Does the opposite work going the other way?  
If it does I wanna devolve back to a monkey  
I wanna be a monkey that's for sure  
I wanna be a monkey like Curious George  
I would sit around all day just eating bananas  
I might be naked or just wear pyjamas  
And make my money appearing in hilarious movies  
Monkey see, monkey do  
That would be my excuse  
It's not my fault, I'm just a monkey who can see  
I wanna be a monkey, that'd be nice  
I wanna be a monkey, eating other monkey's lice  
When they say it's so easy that a monkey could do it  
I'd be more than happy to prove it  
Then you'd know for sure if it was easy or not  
And if you wanna see the home of Michael Jackson  
I could provide some simian distraction  
Cuz we all know monkeys are Michael's second biggest weakness  
I wanna be a monkey yes I do  
I wanna be a monkey and fling my poo  
I wanna be a monkey  
I'd be agape if I was an ape  
What a thrilla to be a gorilla  
It would rock to be a macaque  
I wanna be a monkey


When I was a kid I wanted to grow up and be cop in a province town or county  
I thought it would be great if someday I could only ever be a mountie  
I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because that's part of the
profession  
But now I sit on my horse and tell American tourists the Parliament's in
session  
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every
parade  
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending my career in
motorcades  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos  
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no, the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I used to think that a mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble, strong and
thrifty  
But even though we don't break ranks, we get no thanks, they took us off the
fifty (dollar bill)  
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like guards in shopping malls, it's
such a pain  
Like someone's plotting the assassination of the Minister if Sports and
Recreation, oh that's insane  
Sometimes I just want to puke on Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Dudley Do-
Right's such a jerk (Damn you, Snidely)  
And though he tries with all his heart, my horse couldn't catch a golfing
cart, some days I hate to go to work  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos  
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no, the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos

Oh no, the RCMP

Oh, no, it's not the life for me  
Oh, no, it's not the life for me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-
me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me


Come back proud canadian's,  
To before you had TV.  
No hockey night in canada,  
There was no CBC.  
  
In 1812 madison was mad,  
He was the president you know.  
Well he thought he'd tell the british where they ought to go.  
He thought he'd invade canada,  
He thought that he was tough.  
Instead we went to washington,  
And burned down all his stuff.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
Those hilbilies from kentucky,  
Dressed in green and red.  
Left home to fight in canada,  
But they returned home dead.  
It's the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam.  
And also the alomo and the bay of ham.  
The looser was america,  
The winner was ourselfs.  
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
In 1812 we were just sitting around,  
Minding our own business,  
Putting crops into the ground.  
We heard the soilders coming,  
And we didn't like that sound.  
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground.  
  
Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming,  
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and the yankies started running,  
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.  
They ran through the snow,  
And they ran through the forest,  
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn't go,  
They ran so fast they forgot to take they're culture,  
Back to america, and gulf and mexico.  
  
So if you go to washington,  
It's building clean and nice,  
Bring a pack of matches,  
And we'll burn the white house twice.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned,  
But the americans wont admit it.  
It burned, burned, burned...  
It burned and burned and burned  
It burned, burned, burned  
I bet that made them mad.  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.


My father was a lawyer, mom's at university  
My brother and my sister, they both have their Ph.D.  
My grampa was a pilot shooting Nazis from t he sky  
But I am the most famous, I'm a TV weather guy  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
H e always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
They said that I'm not qualified to be on the TV  
Don't know Celsius from Fahrenheit so I just say degrees  
I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies  
And end up being right more than the guy on channel five  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five A.M.  
Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens  
Greeting all the viewers with a "Hi-hi-hip-hello!"  
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show  
  
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock  
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog  
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry  
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy  
  
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman  
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland  
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal  
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210  
  
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke  
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
He's got a steady income as a TV weather guy!


He was working at the record shop  
I would kiss him in the parking lot  
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop  
Seventeen  
He would tell me I was beautiful  
Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool  
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules  
Seventeen  
  
Hey, those days are long gone  
And when I hear this song it takes me back  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
Seventeen  
  
Stealing beers out of the trailer park  
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark  
My favorite place was sitting in his car  
Seventeen  
We laid a blanket on the roof top  
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop  
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot  
Seventeen  
  
Hey, those days are long gone  
And when I hear this song it takes me back  
  
We were on top of the world,  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
  
We were running red lights  
We were going all night  
Didn't care about anything  
We were living our dream  
It was you and me  
And we were seventeen  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh...  
Seventeen  
Seventeen  
  
I remember what it felt like  
Just a small town kind of life  
If I could only just go back in time,  
Seventeen  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
  
We were running red lights  
We were going all night  
Didn't care about anything  
We were living our dream  
It was you and me  
And we were seventeen  
  
Seventeen  
Seventeen  
Seventeen


All the small things  
True care, truth brings  
I'll take one lift  
Your ride, best trip  
  
Always, I know  
You'll be at my show  
Watching, waiting  
Commiserating  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go  
Turn the lights off, carry me home  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
  
Late night, come home  
Work sucks, I know  
She left me roses by the stairs  
Surprises let me know she cares  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go  
Turn the lights off, carry me home  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go  
Turn the lights off, carry me home  
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill  
The night will go on, my little windmill  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go (na na na na na na na na na na)  
Turn the lights off, carry me home (na na na na na na na na na na)  
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill (na na na na na na na na na na)  
The night will go on, the night will go on (na na na na na na na na na na)  
My little windmill


Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh myself to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
Sometimes I drive so fast  
Just to feel the danger  
I want to scream  
It makes me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breathe?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
To walk within the lines  
Would make my life so boring  
I want to know that I  
Have been to the extreme  
So knock me off my feet  
Come on now give it to me  
Anything to make me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.  
  
Let down your defenses  
Use no common sense  
If you look you will see  
That this world is a beautiful  
Accident turbulent succulent  
Opulent permanent, no way  
I want to taste it  
Don't want to waste it away  
  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh my self to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.

Lay back, it's all been done before  
And if you could only let it be  
You will see  
I like you the way you are  
When we're drivin' in your car  
And you're talking to me one on one  
But you've become  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else  
You're watching your back like you can't relax  
You're tryin' to be cool  
You look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
  
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you're  
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated  
And life's like this you,  
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it
into  
Honesty, you promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it  
No, no, no  
  
You come over unannounced  
Dressed up like you're somethin' else  
Where you are ain't where it's at you see, you're making me  
Laugh out when you strike your pose  
Take off all your preppy clothes  
You know, you're not fooling anyone  
When you've become  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else  
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax

I do not think that I can wait  
To go over and to talk to you  
I do not know what I should say  
  
And I walk out in silence  
That's when I start to realize  
What you bring to my life  
Damn, this guy can make me cry  
  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
All the time  
  
They all say that you're no good for me  
But I'm too close to turn around  
I'll show them they don't know anything  
I think I've got you figured out  
  
So I walk out in silence  
That's when I start to realize  
What you bring to my life  
Damn, this guy can make me smile  
  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
  
I'll give you everything  
I'll treat you right  
If you just give me a chance  
I can prove I'm right  
  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
All the time


Please go away,  
Leave me alone.  
To you I have nothing to say,  
My voice has no tone.  
  
I'd rather be there,  
Because you're here.  
Whatever, I don't care,  
Because of you there was a tear.  
  
No one cares about me,  
No one needs me.  
But don't you see,  
I do whatever you do to me.  
  
Do you hate me,  
'cause I know I hate you.  
That's why I want you to stay away from me,  
You weren't the only one that I knew.  
  
Don't try to touch my feelings.  
Don't try to see what's on my mind.  
'cause the last thing I'd do is let you  
Back in my life. I despise you...


Destiny  
  
Searching for my destiny  
Not knowing where to look  
Searching all over the world  
Pointless, without a system  
  
Where is my destiny?  
Where and what is my destiny?  
You will always know  
That I'm looking for it with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is it in the sky?  
Under the sea or on the ground?  
In a wood or in the deserts?  
On a mountain or in a valley?  
  
Together we will find our destiny  
Together we will search  
All those years, looking  
All those years, pointless  
  
Why do I say it was pointless  
Looking for it with you  
I will give you the reason  
My destiny... Is you...


[Verse 1]  
Grains of sand slip through your hands  
Never seasing time  
Fold your hands in silent prayer  
Eternal peace you'll find  
  
[Chorus]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity  
  
[Verse 2]  
Let the rain falling on your face  
Run into your eyes  
Can you see the rainbow now  
Through the stormy skies  
  
[Chorus] [x2]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity  
  
[Verse 3]  
Standing in the rising tide  
Heaven's light shines on you, on you, on you  
Test the sea rising at your feet  
How far can you go  
'Till you need God's helping hand  
To ride the undertoe  
  
[Chorus][x3]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity


Seeing you, walk right by me,  
Makes me think you really love me,  
Tell me, why is this going on?  
If you love me then please tell me,  
Is this unordinary?  
Is this extrordinary?  
Just please... Tell me... Don't go,  
Seeing the same places everyday,  
Let me go somewhere that I never been before,  
This is just more,  
Of my...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everyday life,  
Seeing you everyday,  
Going to band on Mondays,  
With no limit anyomre,  
But nothing more, than my  
Everyday life,  
Partyin' on Wednesday nights,  
Going to my car on Friday mornings,  
Like an everyday story,  
  
Just go by the sound of my drummer drumming,  
And the sounds of the guitars slamming,  
Just... You should know,  
Sweetly walking to my locker,  
Open it up to find a note,  
Heres what he wrote:  
'Girl, I know you want me,  
If you do, come and get me,  
Be at the park, by sundown,  
When nobody else is around,  
Be there if you want me. '  
Signed no name,  
By the look in my eyes,  
I could tell it was him,  
He stared at me, with a grin,  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is my everyday life,  
Going through my pages  
Through the good and the bad times  
Why are you, sayin' to me,  
This ain't your everyday life girl,  
Your everyday life is you and me,  
My everyday life,  
  
Why go thorugh the pain,  
When the love and sorrow's just gonna drain,  
Now this is my everyday life.


You say you turned it off hid your heart upon a shelf  
Scared of what it might cost to take it down for sombody else  
Cause loving her you lost too much of yourself  
Baby can't you see that she's not me  
Not me at all  
  
And I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Don't compare her to me, believe in love  
  
I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you  
I'll open up my soul if that is what you need me to do  
Now baby it's your move all you got to do is  
Believe in love just believe in us  
  
And I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Just believe in love, just believe in us  
  
Just believe in love just believe in us  
  
Baby  
  
I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Come and fall into me  
Baby fall into me


I looked away  
Then I looked back at you  
You tried to say  
Things that you can't undo  
If I had my way  
I'd never get over you  
Today's the day  
I pray that we make it through  
Make it through the fall  
Make it through it all  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
  
You're the only one  
I'd be with 'til the end  
When I come undone  
You bring me back again  
Back under the stars  
Back into your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
  
Want to know who you are  
Want to know where to start  
I want to know what this means  
Want to know how you feel  
Want to know what is real  
I want to know everything, everything  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
  
I'm in love with you  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you


If fear's what makes us decide  
Our future journey  
Well I'm not along for the ride  
'Cause I'm still yearning  
  
To try and touch the sky  
My fingers burning  
Before you are old you're young  
Yeah I'm stilling learning  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
I'm standing out in the street  
The earth is moving  
I feel it under my feet  
And I'm still proving  
  
That I can stand my ground  
And my feet are there  
Having washed my hair  
To be lost before you are found  
Don't mean you're losing  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
Someday I'll live in a house  
Etc, etc, etc  
But you know that's not for now  
For now I'm falling down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Yea, yeah, yeah  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Falling right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
I am falling down (falling, falling, falling)  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
(oh you're falling)


I woke up and saw the sun today  
You came by without a warning  
You put a smile on my face  
I want that for every morning  
  
What is it I'm feeling?  
'Cause I can't let it go  
If seeing is believing  
Then I already know  
  
I'm falling fast  
I hope this lasts  
I'm falling hard for you  
I say "let's take a chance"  
Take it while we can  
I know you feel it too  
  
I'm falling fast  
I'm falling fast  
  
It doesn't matter what we do  
You make everything seem brighter  
I never knew I needed you  
Like a sad time needs a sea of lighters  
  
What is it I'm feeling?  
'Cause I can't let it go  
If seeing is believing  
I already know  
  
I'm falling fast  
'Cause I hope this lasts  
'Cause I'm falling hard for you  
I say "let's take a chance"  
Take it while we can  
'Cause I know you feel it too  
  
I'm falling fast  
I'm falling fast  
  
I hope you know  
I hope it lasts  
I'm falling hard, I'm falling fast  
We can go, no holding back  
  
I'm falling fast  
I hope this lasts  
I'm falling hard for you  
I say "let's take a chance"  
Take it while we can  
I know you feel it too  
  
I'm falling fast  
I'm falling fast


Don't matter what people say  
I never did believe them  
I know, I know they know everything  
  
I'll be alright by myself  
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined  
Confined by love  
  
Now our days seem strange  
I guess my heart was bound to change  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
I never thought that I'd say  
That I don't really miss you  
I lived, I breathed your breath through me  
  
Time has a way of passing by  
Until I don't remember why  
Or how to hurt for you  
  
Love's pain has gone somewhere  
And I'm finally hanging it there  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
Falling into,  
Falling into,  
You're falling into history  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
I'll be alright by myself  
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined  
Confined by love


I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
Every one is making fun of me.  
I have no friends,  
I'm a loner,  
And what else is there to do,  
But...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel sorry for myself,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
I'm such a loner,  
I have no friends,  
What else is there to do,  
But feel sorry for myself,  
  
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah [x2]  
  
No one likes me,  
I'm living on the streets,  
I have no parents,  
And I've split up with my band,  
What else is there to do,  
But...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel sorry for myself,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
I'm such a loner,  
I have no friends,  
What else is there to do,  
But feel sorry for myself  
  
[Bridge:]  
Yeah yeah,  
I'm feeling,  
I'm feeling,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
Yeah yeah,  
Yeah yeah,  
I'm feeling  
Feeling  
Sorry for myself  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feeling sorry for myself,  
Feeling sorry for myself,  
Nothing to do,  
Nothing else to  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Nothing else to do,  
Nothing else do but,  
  
Feel Sorry For Myself


[Verse 1]  
There's a light inside of all of us  
It's never hiding, you just have to light it  
It's the one thing that you gotta trust  
It's like a diamond, you just have to find it  
So if you ever feel like giving up  
Yeah, just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
We were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly  
Your time to fly  
  
[Verse 2]  
A little help is all it ever takes  
Somebody has to tell you it's worth fighting  
A single step becomes a leap of faith  
That's when you realize you started flying  
So don't you ever say you're giving up  
No, there's no looking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've touched the sky  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've realized  
  
[Chorus - Variation]  
That we were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
It's you time to shine, shine  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
(Spread your wings across the universe)  
It's your time to shine, shine  
(There's a light inside of all of us)  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly


I guess I was foolish to understand  
That fact that I'm leaving my life and starting all over again,  
  
One day sittin back looking at old memories,  
Thinkin bout those little things that you told me,  
But what if I wasn't jokin,  
They're all lookin at those who are provokin,  
Little things that worry me are about to end  
Just like you and me being friends  
If I knew that this was gonna happen,  
Then I would of just said,  
  
[Chorus:]  
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone'  
Don't go together that's what you said to me on the phone  
But I don't think so, those are what I am.  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,  
You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I don't.  
  
Think of me as a distraction  
Stoppping your work stopping your attraction  
Little as I know.  
I'm a girl who likes who no one would ever of dream of me thinking,  
Little as I don't know.  
Whatever caused me to stop the moment  
The moment when I wished say I love you.  
But my dreams go away  
  
[Chorus:]  
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone'  
Don't go together that's what you said to me on the phone  
But I don't think so, those are what I am.  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,  
You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I don't.  
  
We're newlyweds thirteen years later  
I'm dressed in a gown laying down,  
My dream didn't fade.


Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
I'm giving up on everything  
Because you messed me up  
  
Don't know how much you  
You screwed it up  
You never listened  
That's just too bad  
  
Because I'm moving on  
I won't forget  
You were the one that was wrong  
I know I need to step up and be strong  
  
Don't patronize me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you forgotten  
Everything that I wanted  
Do you forget it now  
You never got It  
Do you get it now  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
Gotta get away  
There's no point in thinking about yesterday  
  
It's too late now  
It won't ever be the same  
We're so different now  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know I want to run away  
I know I want to run away  
Run away  
  
If only I could run away  
If only I could run away  
Run away  
  
I told you what i wanted I  
I told you what i wanted  
What I wanted  
  
But I was forgotten  
I won't be forgotten  
Never Again  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah


There's not much going on today  
I'm really bored, it's getting late  
What happened to my Saturday? (Saturday)  
Monday's coming, the day I hate, hate  
  
Sit on the bed alone (Bed alone)  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
This is when I start to bite my nails  
And clean my room when all else fails  
I think it's time for me to bail (Time to bail)  
This point of view is getting stale-ale  
  
Sit on the bed alone (Bed alone)  
Staring at the phone (At the phone)  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
Uh, uh (hey, hey)  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (hey, hey)  
Uh, uh, hey, hey  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (hey, hey)  
  
Na, na, na, na, na (we've all got choices)  
Na, na, na ,na (we've all got voices)  
Na, na, na, na, na (stand up make some noise)  
Na, na, na, na (stand up make some noise)  
  
Sit on the bed alone  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
Like I was special, 'cause I was special  
  
Uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Na, na, na, na, na

Hear your voice in the dark  
Lose myself in your eyes  
Choke my voice Say goodnight  
As the world falls apart  
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go  
I need some more time to fix this  
  
Here's a letter for you  
But the words get confused  
And the conversation dies  
Apologize for the past  
Talk some shit take it back  
Are we cursed to this life  
  
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this  
  
I'm talking to the ceiling  
My life just lost all meaning  
Do one thing for me tonight  
I'm dying in this silence  
  
The last star left in heaven  
Is falling down to earth and  
Do you still feel the same way  
Do you still feel the same way  
  
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this


Far off into the distance  
Holding on inside  
Nobody to hear me scream  
Nobody to hear me cry  
Too close to no nobody  
Too far to hold onto life  
There's nowhere to run  
And onwhere to hide  
  
Hold onto yourself  
Hold onto the life that u live  
Hold onto me  
And neva let go  
Don't be afraid  
To face the dangers each day  
Hold onto me  
And neva let go  
  
Too heavy to fly away  
Too light to try to die  
Too false to live no truth  
Too trughful to deny  
Too weak to live  
Too strong to hold back now  
Too many answers  
To ask the qusetion how  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't deny that u live  
Don't deny that u breathe  
Just hold onto me  
Don't lie 'cos ur real  
Don't lie u can deal with this  
Hold onto me  
  
[Chorus][x2]


I'm not afraid of anything,  
I just need to know that I can breathe  
And I don't need much of anything  
But suddenly suddenly  
  
I am small and the world is big  
All around me is fast moving  
Surrounded by so many things  
Suddenly suddenly,  
  
[Chorus]  
How does it feel to be  
Different from me  
Are we the same  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel to be  
Different from me  
Are we the same  
How does it feel?  
  
I am Young and I am free  
But I get tired and I get weak  
I get lost and I can't sleep  
But suddenly suddenly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you comfort me...  
Would you cry with me...  
Uh-uh-oh-oh uh-oh uh-oh [Repeat: x2]  
  
I am small and the world is big  
But I'm not afraid of anything  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
Your different from me  
Different [Repeat: x3]  
  
Your different from me...


Every now and then we all want something  
Even if there's no way of gettin' it  
If i stomach that that's the way it must be  
Be the way around it, could I get myself around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
  
don't want to always have to be so nice  
don't want to hear you say well that's just life  
I dry out when I open my mouth  
I make my way around it, make my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  
  
I'm not about to take no for an answer  
no  
If I tell you I can't I'm still gonna go  
I did it all by myself  
I found my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  
  
It's not to lovely  
It could start to get ugly  
It really bugs me  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  


La, la  
la, la, la, la  
la, la  
la, la, la  
  
I like your smile  
I like your vibe  
I like your style  
But that's not why I love you  
And I, I like the way, you're such a star  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
  
Do you feel,  
do you feel me,  
do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need,  
do you need me,  
do you need me  
  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
  
Being you, just you  
yeah the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
La, la  
la, la, la, la  
la, la  
la, la, la  
  
I like the way you misbehave  
When we get wasted  
But that's not why I love you  
And how you keep your cool when I am complicated  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
  
Do you feel,  
do you feel me,  
do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need,  
do you need me,  
do you need me  
  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
And I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
yeah the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
yeah, oh, oh, oh,  
oh, oh, oh, oh  
Even though we didn't make it through  
I am always here for you  
yeah,  
  
oh you're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
now the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
La la, la la la la (oh, oh)  
La la, la la la la (that's why I love you)  
La la, la la la la (oh, oh)  
La la, la la la la (that's why I love you)


There's nothing I can say to you  
Nothing I could ever do to make you see  
What you mean to me  
All the pain the tears I cried  
Still you never said goodbye and now I know how far you'd go  
I know I let you down but its not like that now  
This time I'll never let you go  
  
I will be all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
All my life I'll be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK  
  
I thought that I had every thing I didn't know what life could bring  
But now I see honestly  
You're the one thing I got right  
The only one I let inside  
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me  
And if I let you down I'll turn it all around  
Cause I would never let you go  
  
I will be all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
All my life I'll be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK  
  
'Cause with out you I can't sleep  
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave  
You're all I got  
You're all I want  
Yeah  
And with out you I don't know what I'll do  
I could never ever live a day with out you  
Here with me do you see you're all I need  
  
And I will be all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
All my life (my life) I will be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK  
  
I will be (I'll be) all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
And all my life you know I will be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK


Outside the carolers start to sing  
I can't descibe the joy they bring  
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me  
  
My boifriend is by my side  
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice  
Their whiny voices get irritating  
It's Christmas time again  
  
So I stand with a dead smile on my face  
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste  
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers  
  
And then I guess I must have snapped  
Because I grabbed the baseball bat  
And made them all run for shelter  
  
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand  
All year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve  
Cause the cops came and arrested me  
They had an unfair advantage  
And even though the jail didn't have a tree  
Christmas came a night early  
Cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package  
  
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand  
All year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas


I got no regret right now (I'm feeling this)  
The air is so cold and low (I'm feeling this)  
Let me go in his room (I'm feeling this)  
I want to take off his clothes (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)  
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)  
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Where do we go from here  
Turn all the lights down now  
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)  
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)  
Were taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)  
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
This place was never the same again  
After you came and went  
How can you say you meant anything different  
To anyone standing alone on the street  
With a cigarette on the first night we met  
  
Look to the past and remember your smile  
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile  
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep  
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
(Are we alone, do you feel it, so lost and disillusioned)


Do you ever feel  
So perfect  
You're not for real  
But it's worth it  
It seems like  
Evrybody's friends  
And in time  
You know that this will end  
  
But you're not thinking of how it should be done  
So maybe you're losing your mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I can think of a thousand places  
That I know I could be  
But it's just one of those days  
When I'm hopeless and useless but happy  
  
Do you ever work out  
How it could be done  
I ain't got a doubt  
I know this is the one  
And if you feel  
Like nothing will change  
Stay for real  
Reality's not out of your range  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Another milestone  
Or maybe not so  
But still you can turn  
You can burn  
Or just go  
But it all  
Fills up  
In the end  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
Do you ever feel  
So perfect  
You're not for real  
But it's worth it  
  
In the end


Kiss Me out of the bearded barley,  
Nightly, beside the green green grass.  
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step,  
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.  
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,  
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.  
Lift your open hand,  
Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
  
Kiss me down by the broken tree house,  
Swing me upon it's hanging tire.  
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat,  
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.  
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,  
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.  
Lift your open hand,  
Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,  
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.  
Lift your open hand,  
Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
Now kiss me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la


Oooohh oooohhh  
  
  
Momma take this badge off of me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
  
  
Momma put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is coming down  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
(yaaa yaaa)  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
  
  
Ooooooooooooohhhhhh


Hey, yea, ohoh (3x)  
  
I've only got 3 dollars left in my hands,  
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man  
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel  
I'm living in at a fancy hotel, yeayea  
Then I'll go up to my room  
Fixate on what's the deal  
I'm alone again  
Then I will crawl into the bed,  
And call you up to tell you off  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone  
Before I lose my mind  
Because you lied and so did I  
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y  
If I let you go tonight if I let you go tonight  
Yea, yea, let go  
  
Hey, yea, ohoh  
  
I'll probably wake up a little sad  
But then I'll get up and let go of it all instead  
Because really it's not worth it  
To get in a mess over him  
To bother get stressed over him  
So I'll just go on with my life  
And fixate on everything else but you  
Yea I'll just go on with my life  
I have no reason to please you anymore  
  
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone  
Before I lose my mind  
Because you lied and so did I  
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y  
If I let you go tonight if I let you go  
  
So find your way out of my sight  
I know it's hard, it's tough to laugh  
It's all messed up, don't play this game  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
Yea, yea  
Getting stressed over you  
Getting messed over you


Are you aware of what  
You make me feel, baby  
Right now I feel invisible to you  
Like I'm not real  
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you  
Why'd you turn away  
Here's what I have to say  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with the lost stare  
That's when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there  
When I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
You, you need to listen  
I'm startin' to trip  
I'm losing my grip  
And I'm in this thing alone  
(oh oh yeah)  
  
Am I just some chick  
You placed beside you  
To take somebody's place?  
When you turn around  
  
Can you recognize my face?  
You used to love me  
You used to hug me  
But that wasn't the case  
Everything wasn't ok  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with a lost stare  
That's when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
You, you need to listen  
I'm starting to trip  
I'm losing my grip  
And I'm in this thing alone  
  
Crying out loud  
I'm crying out loud  
Crying out loud  
I'm crying out loud  
Open your eyes  
Open up wide  
  
Why should I care  
Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
If you don't care then I don't care  
  
We're not going anywhere  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
Why should I care  
If you don't care then I don't care  
We're not going anywhere


Layin' on the couch just,  
Hangin' with my boys  
We're chillin' up the house tonight  
I'm being myself  
I'm nobody else 'cause  
This is what we do alright  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not wearing any make-up,  
Won't hide who I am,  
I'll be what I am  
I'm just being honest with my self once again  
I'm my only friend  
  
Kickin' off my shoes  
I'm strummin' my guitar  
I'm singin' songs about my life  
If I could tell the truth  
I'd tell you what I meant by  
Me, myself, and I  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No more mirrors  
No more vanity  
Give it all away for free  
Donate to charity  
I am happy in my skin  
I try, in my heart it's not the same  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight


I wake up in the morning  
Put on my face  
The one that's gonna get me  
Through another day  
Doesn't really matter  
How I feel inside  
'Cause life is like a game sometimes  
  
But then you came around me  
The walls just disappeared  
Nothing to surround me  
And keep me from my fears  
I'm unprotected  
See how I've opened up  
Oh, you've made me trust  
  
Because I've never felt like this before  
I'm naked  
Around you  
Does it show?  
You see right through me  
And I can't hide  
I'm naked  
Around you  
And it feels so right  
  
I'm trying to remember  
Why I was afraid  
To be myself and let the  
Covers fall away  
I guess I never had someone like you  
To help me, to help me fit  
In my skin  
  
I never felt like this before  
I'm naked  
Around you  
Does it show?  
You see right through me  
And I can't hide  
I'm naked  
Around you  
And it feels so right  
  
I'm naked  
Oh oh yeah  
Does it show?  
Yeah, I'm naked  
Oh oh, yeah yeah  
  
I'm so naked around you  
And I can't hide  
You're gonna see right through, baby


I'm sorry if this hurts you,  
But I tried to keep what we had once,  
I was wrong it wasn't keeping me awake,  
  
You didn't listen, you didn't listen  
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear me  
When I said I want more, I got no more  
You weren't stealing me away  
  
Oh it's not enough,  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to get me, everything I need  
And I, I wish it was  
I think it's time to give this up  
  
All, all, all, all  
All, all, all, all, all  
All the memories that we're losing  
All the time that I spent with you everyday  
I think is running down the drain  
  
I'm feeling (feelin') that we're fading  
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be  
It's a lot easier than it seems yeah  
  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to get me, everything I need  
And I, I wish it was  
I think it's time to give this up  
  
And I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly  
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now  
I can see we're burning out  
So show me, show me  
How you gonna turn it around?  
Because  
  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to get me everything I need  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to get me everything I need  
And I wish it was  
I think its time to give this up  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to get me everything I need  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to get me


He'd already asked for my number  
When will he call?, I wonder  
I'd give it away on a Friday  
I haven't heard a friggin' now it's Wednesday  
I don't know what he's thinking,  
He can leave me alone and I'll be waiting  
I don't think so  
There's other fish in the sea  
Who would love to swim with me  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be  
For me (for me)  
  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea  
  
You finally called and I'm not home  
Don't even bother at all  
Can't remember what he looks like  
It's been 14 days, that's not my type  
I know they're not all like that  
There's gotta be some that don't think they're all that  
Yes I know so,  
There's other fish in the sea  
Who would love to swim with me  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be  
For me (for me)  
  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea (in the sea)  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea (fishes in the sea)  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be (be)  
For me (for me)  
  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)


La la la, la la la la  
  
I know your kind of girl  
You only care about one thing  
"Who you've seen, or where you've been?"  
"Who's got money?"  
  
I see that look in your eyes  
It tells a million lies  
But deep inside, I know why  
You're talking to him  
  
I know what you're all about  
I really hope he figures it out  
  
[Chorus]  
She's one of those girls  
They're nothing but trouble  
Just one look and now you're seeing double  
Before you know it she'll be gone  
Off to the next one  
She's so good that you won't see it comin'  
She'll take you for a ride, and you'll be left with nothing  
You'll be broke, and she'll be gone  
Off to the next one  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Off to the next one  
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh  
  
She's gonna be the end of you  
At least that's what they say  
It's been a while  
You're in denial  
And now it's too late  
The way she looks makes you hide  
All the warning signs  
'Cause her blond hair, her blue eyes  
Makes you wanna die  
  
I know what she's all about  
I really hope you figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know it's a game, you know it's a game  
She keeps playing around with your head  
Playing around with your head  
She's so insane, so insane  
She's the one to blame, she's the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Off to the next one  
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah  
Off to the next one


Remember when I cried to you a thousand times  
I told you everything  
You know my feelings  
It never crossed my mind  
That there would be a time  
For us to say goodbye  
What a big surprise  
  
But I'm not lost  
I'm not gone  
I haven't forgot  
  
These feelings I can't shake no more  
These feelings are running out the door  
I can feel it falling down  
And I'm not coming back around  
These feelings I can't take no more  
This emptiness in the bottom drawer  
It's getting harder to pretend  
And I'm not coming back around again  
  
Remember when  
  
I remember when it was together till the end  
Now I'm alone again  
Where do I begin?  
I cried a little bit  
You died a little bit  
Please say there's no regrets  
And say you won't forget  
But I'm not lost  
And I'm not gone  
I haven't forgot  
  
These feelings I can't shake no more  
These feelings are running out the door  
I can feel it falling down  
And I'm not coming back around  
These feelings I can't take no more  
This emptiness in the bottom drawer  
It's getting harder to pretend  
And I'm not coming back around again  
  
Remember when  
That was then  
Now it's the end  
I'm not coming back  
I can't pretend  
Remember when  
  
These feelings I can't shake no more  
These feelings are running out the door  
I can feel it falling down  
And I'm not coming back around  
These feelings I can't take no more  
This emptiness in the bottom drawer  
It's getting harder to pretend  
And I'm not coming back around again


Let them know that we're still rock n roll  
I don't care about my makeup  
I like it better with my jeans all ripped out  
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut  
You say so what  
(What)  
  
I don't care if I'm misfit  
I like it better then the hipster of all shit  
I am the mother fucking princess  
You still love me  
  
Some some how  
It's a little different when  
I'm with you  
You know what I really am  
On the phone  
You know how it really goes  
(Oh oh oh oh yeh)  
  
Some some way  
We'll be getting out of this  
Time one day  
You're the only one that I  
Want with me  
You know how the story goes  
(Oh oh oh)  
  
When it's you and me  
We don't need no one to tell us who to be  
We'll keep turning up the radio  
Well it's you and I  
Just put up  
A middle finger to the sky  
That them know that we're still rock n roll  
  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey


Boy, you get me so high  
Buzzin' like a beehive  
It's just a little kiss  
But when It hits my lips  
I'm sippin' on sunshine  
Boy you're looking so fly  
Hotter than July  
I just wanna stay  
Forever and today  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach, you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby, I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin' but a good time  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go  
So we'll go with the flow  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Boy, you blow my mind  
You got me up on cloud nine  
Just a little taste  
I wouldn't wanna waste  
A sip of that sunshine  
  
We can kick it all night  
Underneath the moonlight  
But when the party ends  
We'll do it all again  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach, you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby, I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin' but a good time  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go  
So we'll go with the flow  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin' on sunshine...  
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin' on sunshine...  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste (a taste so good)  
Nothin' but a good time (good time)  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go (do, don't)  
So we'll go with the flow (hell yeah)  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
All day all night  
Yeah, good time  
Everybody just sippin' on sunshine  
  
Woah, woah, woah,  
Sippin' on sunshine


He was a boy  
She was a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
He was a punk  
  
She did ballet  
What more can I say  
He wanted her  
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well  
  
But all of her friends  
Stuck up their nose  
They had a problem with his baggy clothes  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
She had a pretty face  
But her head was up in space  
She needed to come back down to earth  
  
Five years from now  
She sits at home  
Feeding the baby she's all alone  
She turns on t.v  
  
Guess who she sees  
Skater boy rockin' up MTV  
She calls up her friends  
They already know  
  
And they've all got  
Tickets to see his show  
She tags along  
Stands in the crowd  
Looks up at the man that she turned down  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
Now he's a super star  
Slamming on his guitar  
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
Now he's a super star  
Slamming on his guitar  
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?  
  
Sorry girl but you missed out  
Well tough luck that boy's mine now  
We are more than just good friends  
This is how the story ends  
  
Too bad that you couldn't see,  
See the man that boy could be  
There is more that meets the eye  
I see the soul that is inside  
  
He's just a boy  
And I'm just a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
We are in love  
Haven't you heard  
How we rock each others world  
  
I'm with the skater boy  
I said see you later boy  
I'll be back stage after the show  
I'll be at the studio  
Singing the song we wrote  
About a girl you used to know  
  
I'm with the skater boy  
I said see you later boy  
I'll be back stage after the show  
I'll be at the studio  
Singing the song we wrote  
About a girl you used to know


I miss you, miss you so bad  
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad  
I hope you can hear me  
I remember it clearly  
  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day I found it won't be the same  
Ooh  
  
Nah nah la la la nah nah  
  
I didn't get around to kiss you  
Goodbye on the hand  
I wish that I could see you again  
I know that I can't  
  
Ooh  
I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly  
  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day I found it won't be the same  
Ooh  
  
I had my wake up  
Won't you wake up  
I keep asking why  
And I can't take it  
It wasn't fake  
It happened, you passed by  
  
Now your gone, now your gone  
There you go, there you go  
Somewhere I can't bring you back  
Now your gone, now your gone  
There you go, there you go,  
Somewhere your not coming back  
  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day I found it won't be the same no  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day that I found it won't be the same ooh  
  
Nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah  
I miss you


Load up on guns  
Bring your friends  
It's fun to lose  
And to pretend  
She's over bored  
And self assured  
I know, I know  
A dirty word  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now, entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yah  
  
Hey  
  
Hey  
I'm worse at what I do best  
And for this gift I feel blessed  
Our little group has always been  
And always will until the end  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yah  
  
Hey  
  
Hey  
And I forget just why I taste  
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile  
I found it hard  
It's hard to find  
Oh well, whatever, nevermind  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito

A denial(x9)


You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control (oh, oh)  
But you don't really give a shit  
You go with it, go with it, go with it  
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock n' roll  
  
You said hey  
What's your name  
It took one look  
And now I'm not the same  
Yeah you said hey  
And since that day  
You stole my heart  
And you're the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, and that's why I smile  
It's been a while  
Since every day and everything has  
Felt this right  
And now you turn it all around  
And suddenly you're all I need  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
Last night I blacked out I think  
What did you, what did you put in my drink  
I remember making out and then (oh, oh)  
I woke up with a new tattoo  
Your name was on me and my name was on you  
I would do it all over again  
  
You said hey (hey)  
What's your name (what's your name)  
It took one look  
And now I'm not the same  
Yeah you said hey (hey)  
Since that day (since that day)  
You stole my heart  
And you're the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control  
You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
The reason, the reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh


I woke up this morning  
Knowing it had to end  
That useless calling  
Don't you know it drives me round the bend  
  
If honesty speaks truth  
I've said to many lies  
I'm tied up just let me loose  
I just can't decide  
  
'cause i wanted someone to come along  
And make me feel too damn good  
But baby you're average and I've had to much of that kind  
And I don't think I should  
And I just wish  
  
[CHORUS]  
You would  
Not be  
So good  
To me  
Then I  
Wouldn't  
Guess I  
Shouldn't  
And then  
Breaking us apart  
Wouldn't be so hard  
  
Stop making  
Doing  
This  
So damn  
Hard . . .


Oh, how I wish that they would last  
Moments of peace that just slip through me so fast  
Just when I think that they are gonna stay  
Everything inside me just starts fading away  
  
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  
Just gets thrown down on the floor  
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore  
Sometimes I wish that I could run away  
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say  
  
He looks at me and doesn't know the words to say  
But it's not you, I just don't feel quite right today  
All these things I say and do were never planned  
But how the fuck am I supposed to make you understand that  
  
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  
Just gets thrown down on the floor  
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore  
Sometimes I wish that I could run away  
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say


I saw you last night,  
Down at the mere  
I saw your hands were playing gently with her hair  
I see you and I, in my mirror  
I close my eyes and wish that you could be here  
It's my fantasy to have you holding me, baby  
Going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
[Chrous]  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one  
  
(yea, eyeyey)  
  
Get out of my head, get into my heart  
Be for real, are you fictional or real,  
I made up this lie, I made up this life  
When I'm alone it's like you're right here by my side  
It's my fantasy to have you here with me, baby  
Going privately crazy  
If you came I know just what I'd say  
  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my world turn right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one  
  
(heye, yeyeyeye)  
  
It's my fantasy to have you all to me, baby  
I'm going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one


All this talking to you  
I don't know what I'm to do  
I don't know where you stand  
What's inside of your head  
  
All this thinkin' of you  
Is that what you're doin' too  
You're always on my mind  
I talk about you all of the time  
  
Don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
So open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
You're just standing by  
You're just wasting time  
Why don't you just tell me the truth about me and you  
And as the time goes by  
I hope you realize  
If you ask me to  
I just might be with you  
  
So don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
Stop standing there, standing there  
And stop acting like you don't care  
And stop being scared, being scared  
Stop acting like you don't care  
  
So, don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
So, don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I cannot wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
Who I am,  
Who I am,  
Who I am


Just take it take it.  
Just take it take it.  
  
I know what you do,  
Flash me.  
The way it's done,  
Impolitely.  
Just tying to find,  
Some alone time.  
No room to compromise.  
  
Just take it take it.  
Can't take it take it.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be worried for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.  
I'll get by,  
In this life,  
This time.  
  
Take your best shot,  
And press me.  
Write a fictional story,  
For your fee.  
Try to get the world,  
To believe.  
Shocking hell I surprise.  
  
Just take it take it.  
Can't just take it take it.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be sorry for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.  
I'll get by,  
In this life,  
This time.  
  
You see me,  
I see you.  
You're over there.  
You see me,  
I see you.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be sorry for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try to,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from shit.  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.


I cannot find a way  
To describe it  
It's there  
Inside  
  
All I do is hide  
I wish  
That it  
Would just go away  
  
What would  
You do?  
You do?  
If you knew  
What would you do?  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
I feel  
Like I  
Am alone  
All by  
  
Myself  
I need to get around this  
My words  
Are cold  
  
I don't want them to hurt you  
If I  
Show you  
I don't think you'd understand  
'Cause no one understands  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
I'm going nowhere  
On and on and  
I'm getting nowhere  
On and on and  
Take me away  
  
I'm going nowhere  
On and on and  
Up and on and  
Up and on  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
Take me away  
Break me away  
Take me away


Don't say no to anything,  
Yes, yes, say yes to everything,  
Just find away, to get away (wanna run away?)  
Let's take off our clothes, and see if anybody notices  
Then run away, what d'you say?  
Have a little joy have a little faith, live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause you, you, you never know what fate will throw,  
To make you stop,  
I, I, I'm gonna try  
To let this life  
Pick me up and take me away  
  
Run up to a stranger,  
Kiss and tell them that you love them,  
And then walk away,  
You made their day (at least you hope you did)  
Stand up in a restaurant,  
Start dancing on the table,  
Get kicked out for that behavior (oops I did it again)  
Have a little joy have a little faith, live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Don't you know that nothing equals nothing,  
Do anything, do everything, do something  
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing  
  
You, you, you never know what faith will throw,  
To make you stop  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
You, you, you never know what fate will throw,  
To make you stop  
I'm gonna try,  
To let this life,  
Pick me up and take me away


Let me hear you say: "hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)  
All right, now let me hear you say: "hey, hey, ho" (Hey, hey, hey)  
  
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the door  
Even though I told him yesterday and the day before  
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the tab  
And I have to pull my money out, and that looks bad  
  
Where are the hopes, where are the dreams  
My Cinderella story scene?  
When do you think they'll finally see  
  
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better  
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never  
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me  
We're not the same  
  
[Chorus]  
And, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a lot to handle  
You don't know trouble, I'm a hell of a scandal  
Me, I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen  
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen  
  
All right, all right  
Yeah  
  
I hate it when a guy doesn't understand  
Why a certain time of month I don't want to hold his hand  
I hate it when they go out, and we stay in  
And they come home smelling like their ex-girlfriend  
  
But I found my hopes, I found my dreams  
My Cinderella story scene  
Now everybody's gonna see  
  
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better  
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never  
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me  
We're not the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me an A, always give me what I want  
Give me a V, be very, very good to me  
R, are you gonna treat me right?  
I, I can put up a fight  
Give me an L, let me hear you scream loud (let me hear you scream loud)  
  
One, two, three, four  
  
Where are the hopes, where are the dreams  
My Cinderella story scene?  
When do you think they'll finally see  
  
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better  
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never  
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me  
We're not the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me hear you say: "hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)  
All right, now let me hear you say: "hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)  
  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
  
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen


Hello out there, were on the air  
It's hockey night tonight!  
Tension grows,  
As the whistle blows,  
And the puck goes down the ice.  
The goalie jumps,  
And the players bump,  
And the fans all go insane.  
Someone roars:  
"Bobby Scores!"  
At the good old hockey game!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Second Period.  
Players dash,  
With skates a-flash,  
The home team trails behind.  
But they grab the puck,  
And go bursting up,  
And they're down across the line.  
They storm the crease,  
Like bumblebees,  
They travel like a burning flame.  
See them slide the puck inside,  
It's a one one hockey game!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Third Period.  
Last game in the play-offs too.  
Oh take me where, the hockey players,  
Face off down the rink,  
And the Stanley Cup,  
Is all filled up,  
For the champs who win the drink!  
Now the final flick,  
Of a hockey stick,  
And a one gigantic scream:  
"THE PUCK IS IN! THE HOME TEAM WINS!"  
At the good old hockey game  
  
(chorus- repeat 3 times)  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!


[Verse:]  
I know I'll never have him  
But I'm there when you're not over his friend  
I listen when you come to me  
But 'cause of who he is you don't have the time to see  
  
I really feel the way you feel  
Just 'cause it's him don't mean it's not real  
Your always sayin' your love's true  
I listen but I can't say the same for you  
  
[Bridge:]  
What I offer's unreturned  
You don't have time to see me burn  
You've so far failed to see  
How much you're affecting me  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you think of him  
I'm thinkin' of the other guy  
I'm in love to  
He's constantly on my mind  
If you weren't shared by blood  
Then would you have the time  
I don't get to choose  
Who I dream of at night  
You tell me how you feel  
I feel the same way with the other guy  
So bad it's not real  
You can't make me cover it up, you know I really try  
You can see by my skin  
I shiver and shake and I follow him with my eyes  
I'm nervous and I know it's a sin  
But seein' him drives me wild inside  
  
[Verse 3:]  
If it was another  
Maybe not your brother  
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild?  
But then lookin' back  
You've always turned your back  
Would it be ok to listen to my smile?  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your convinced  
He's so unperfect  
But I'm convinced  
That it's worth it  
  
I listen to you goin on and on  
Bout how you and that boy got it on  
You don't have time to listen to me  
I'm in love but you can't see  
I don't have opinions you just talk  
But with me you tell me I'm stupid to feel what I feel  
I can't run away you only let me walk  
Come on now girl, you ain't bein' real


Hanging out behind the club on the weekends  
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends  
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour  
I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there  
  
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing  
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me  
She's the one, she'll always be there  
She took my hand and I made it I swear  
  
Chorus  
  
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know  
She's so cool, better sneak me through her window  
Everything's better when she's around  
I Can't wait until her parents go out of town  
Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
  
When we said we were gonna move to Las Vegas  
I remember the look her mother gave us  
17 without a purpose or direction  
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Black and white picture of her on my wall  
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting  
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance  
Because she kept me waiting  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
With the girl at the rock show  
With the girl at the rock show  
(I'll never forget tonight)  
With the girl at the punk show......


Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry  
You don't know how lovely you are  
I had to find you, tell you I need you  
Tell you I set you apart  
  
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions  
Oh, let's go back to the start  
Running in circles, coming up tails  
Heads on a science apart  
  
Nobody said it was easy  
It's such a shame for us to part  
Nobody said it was easy  
No one ever said it would be this hard  
Oh, take me back to the start  
  
I was just guessing at numbers and figures  
Pulling the puzzles apart  
Questions of science, science and progress  
Do not speak as loud as my heart  
  
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me  
Oh and I rush to the start  
Running in circles, chasing our tails  
Coming back as we are  
  
Nobody said it was easy  
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part  
Nobody said it was easy  
No one ever said it would be so hard  
I'm going back to the start  
  
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh


Are you ready kids?  
I said, "Are you ready?"  
  
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
  
If nautical nonsense be something you wish  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
SpongeBob SquarePants


It's a forgone conclusion, you're love's an illusion  
And the picture is starting to fade  
Boy let's be honest, when it comes to your promise  
It's just a lot of empty words you say  
And the future's only gonna be more of the same  
You've only got yourself to blame  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't  
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do you don't  
That's a given, it doesn't matter anyway  
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't  
So when you say you're gonna change you gotta be kidding  
Tomorrow you didn't,  
Hey hey, I'm outta here today  
  
I used to believe in, all your romantic dreaming  
But it really ain't that cute anymore  
'Cause my time's to precious  
So I wish you the best with  
Whatever it is you're looking for  
Baby this is all for your own good,  
I'm leaving 'cause I know you never would  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't need a crystalball to see it all my dear,  
It doesn't matter what you say,  
It always turns out the same way  
Your predictions are fiction  
And it's tragically clear  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Dadada, Yea)


It's the first time I ever felt this lonely  
I wish someone could cure this pain  
It's funny when you think its gonna work out  
'Til you chose weed over me, you're so lame  
  
I thought you were cool until the point  
But up until the point you didn't call me  
When you said you would  
I finally figured out you're all the same  
Always coming up with some kind of story  
  
Every time I try to make you smile  
You're always feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You can't  
You're too tough  
You think you're loveless  
Is that too much that I'm asking for?  
  
I thought you'd come around when I ignored you  
So I thought you'd have the decency to change  
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning  
'Cause I'm not about to look at your face again  
  
Can't you see that you lie to yourself  
You can't see the world through a mirror  
It won't be too late when the smoke clears  
'Cause I, I am still here  
  
But every time I try to make you smile  
You'd always grow up feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You stand like a stone  
Alone in your zone  
Is it too much that I'm asking for?  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Can't find where I am  
Lying here  
Alone I fear  
Afraid of the dark  
No one to claim  
Alone again  
  
Can't you see that you lie to yourself  
You can't see the world through a mirror  
It won't be too late when the smoke clears  
'Cause I, I am still here  
  
Every time I try to make you smile  
You're always feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You can't  
You're too tough  
You think you're loveless  
It was too much that I asked you for


Used to carry this big old world  
On my shoulders and back  
I used to lie inside my room  
Wondering where I am at  
  
I felt a chill running through my veins  
And wondered, would I be saved?  
I felt the ice building in my soul  
Would it melt away?  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
I used to worry my life away  
Counting every dime  
Shutting out the ones I loved  
Never finding the time  
  
And then one day I was overcome  
By loneliness and despair  
And deep inside I thought I heard  
"Lean on me, I'm here"  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
I pulled the burden from off my back  
And tossed it into the wind  
And stretched my arms toward the sky  
And let my life begin  
  
And like a tree, I have measured up  
Best when I've been cut down  
And like a tree, I can touch the sky  
With my feet on the ground  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me, yeah  
Shining down on me  
Shining down, shining down  
Shining down on me


There's this one guy  
There's no one like him in all the world  
'Cause you can always see  
Those girls down on there knees  
  
In those dark sweaty rooms  
Planning out his thoughts  
He's waiting for just the right  
  
One by one as they  
Walk right through the door, they  
Keep on coming back  
Guess they just want more  
  
He has fun fun fun and you  
Might call him a whore, but  
Just look where he's at 'cause  
He is the one that scores  
  
I saw my friend there  
Out on the field today  
I asked him where he's going, he said  
"All the way," now  
  
One by one as they  
Walk right through the door, they  
Keep on coming back  
Guess they just want more  
  
He has fun fun fun and you  
Might call him a whore, but  
Just look where he's at 'cause  
He is the one that scores  
  
Go!


Be Around Trust my Being.  
Feel the pressure.  
I am alive  
Move around  
And take it real so trust me  
  
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do
your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along
push me out of the way.  
  
I am a human, just like you be with me and pull the pole. Live in our world
beneath our cares  
  
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do
your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along
push me out of the way.  
  
Feel it now.  
Live it now

Forever, forever  
Oh so  
  
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do

push me out of the way.  
  
Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do
your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along
push me out of the way.  
  
I am alive  
And take it real so trust me


Am I dreaming?  
Or Stupid?  
I think I've been hit by cupid  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
You are viewing lyrics of No One Needs To Know by avril lavigne from the album
unknown at Lyricsandsongs. Com  
  
I met a tall, dark and handsome man  
And I've been busy making big plans  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
I got my heart set  
My feet wet  
But he don't even know it yet  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
I'll tell him someday, someway, somehow  
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now  
  
I want bells to ring  
The choir to sing  
A white dress that gets to keep the kinda hold on thing  
But no one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
I'll tell him, someday, someway, someway  
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now.  
  
Gonna have a little girl  
A little boy  
A little engy we call Leroy  
But no one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
And I'm not lo-ohnly anymore at night  
And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right  
And I'm not lo-ohnly anymore at night  
And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right  
  
Am I dreaming?  
Or Stupid?  
But boy have I been hit by cupid.  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
No one needs to know right now


All that I did was walk over  
Start off by shaking your hands  
That's how it went  
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
I wanted to know you  
I wanted to show you  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know me  
Don't ignore me  
You don't want me there  
You just shut me out  
You don't know me  
Don't ignore me  
If you had your way  
You'd just shut me up  
Make me go away  
  
No, I just don't understand why  
You won't talk to me  
It's hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing  
Don't talk words against me  
I wanted to know you  
I wanted to show you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Make me go away  
  
I tried to belong  
It didn't seem wrong  
My head aches  
Its been so long  
I'll write this song  
If that's what it take  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Make me go away  
Make me go away


Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror  
As I drive away  
Wishing that I could take back all those words  
That meant nothing that I didn't say  
  
I'm trying  
To be what you want me to be  
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part  
Of the fool, week after week  
  
I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)  
You say you want someone to call your own  
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride  
You can live your life all on your own  
  
Is this all going to be just another time  
That we play this game?  
I've tried to convince you that things could be different  
But somehow they end up the same  
  
But what  
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?  
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost  
Well, I do, too  
  
I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)  
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when  
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side  
I'll just jack off in my room until then  
  
It's never over 'til it's done  
And I don't think that you're the one  
It's never over 'til it's done  
And I don't think that you're the one


Time is valuable  
Mine is useless  
Next to you i feel nothing  
Nothing makes me fear  
Im me and im strong  
I've a hard heart  
It naver breaks  
  
So,its waste of time attacking to me  
Ill never fall I'll never die  
I ask you if you love me  
And you always lie and lie  
  
Crime is so bad  
You are so mad  
You try to make me  
Exact like you baby  
You will naver do it  
You are fragile  
You will be broken


You say that I'm messing with your head  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
All cause I was making out with your friend  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I can't stop cause I'm having too much fun  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
You're on your knees  
Begging please  
Stay with me  
But honestly  
I just need to be a little crazy  
  
All my life I've been good,  
But now whoa, I'm thinking what the hell  
All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
If you love me  
If you hate me  
You can't save me  
Baby, baby  
All my life I've been good  
But now  
Whoa  
What the hell  
  
So what if I go out on a million dates  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You never call or listen to me anyway  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Don't get me wrong  
I just need some time to play  
  
You're on your knees  
Begging please  
Stay with me  
But honestly  
I just need to be a little crazy  
  
All my life I've been good,  
But now  
I'm thinking what the hell  
All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
  
If you love me  
If you hate me  
You can't save me  
Baby, baby  
All my life I've been good  
But now  
Whoa

I'm messing with you in bed  
  
All my life I've been good,  
But now oh

All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
All my life I've been good,  
But now oh

All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
If you love me  
If you hate me  
You can't save me  
Baby, baby  
All my life I've been good  
But now  
Whoa  
What the hell  
  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la


Why, do you always do this to me?  
Why, couldn't you just see through me?  
How come, you act like this  
Like you just don't care at all  
  
Do you expect me to believe I was the only one to fall?  
I could feel I could feel you near me, even though you're far away  
I could feel I could feel you baby, why  
  
It's not supposed to feel this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me, are you and me still together?  
Tell me, do you think we could last forever?  
Tell me, why  
  
Hey, listen to what we're not saying  
Let's play, a different game than what we're playing  
Try, to look at me and really see my heart  
  
Do you expect me to believe I'm gonna let us fall apart?  
I could feel I could feel you near me, even when you're far away  
I could feel I could feel you baby, why  
  
It's not supposed to feel this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me, are you and me still together?  
Tell me, you think we could last forever?  
Tell me, why  
  
So go and think about whatever you need to think about  
Go ahead and dream about whatever you need to dream about  
And come back to me when you know just how you feel, you feel  
I could feel I could feel you near me, even though you're far away  
I could feel I could feel you baby, why  
  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me  
  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me, are you and me still together?  
Tell me, do you think we could last forever?  
Tell me, why


First glance, you nearly made my jaw drop  
First dance, and you were looking so hot  
How tense, I moved in for a lip-lock  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby  
  
A first taste like honey, you were so yum  
Can't wait for a second 'cause it's so fun  
Third base, I'm headed for a homerun  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go, if you don't, we'll never know  
So if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
My place, you showed up with flowers  
Your face, could stare at it for hours  
Can't wait to see your superpowers  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby  
  
Your car, I'm sitting right beside you  
Rockstar at everything that you do  
My heart is ready for the next move  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go, if you don't, we'll never know  
So if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Yeah yeah, not yet  
Yeah yeah, not yet  
Yeah yeah, not yet  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this

'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet


Excuse me sir, do I have your attention,  
There's something if you don't mind I'd like to mention,  
So open those ears, sit your butt down and shut your mouth up  
I'm aware that it's hard for you to do that,  
All I ask is lay down, put your feet up  
Now soak in, pay attention, learn a lesson loud and clear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, you're a dirty liar,  
You wronged me out for something I thought was right,  
I wanted to be left alone,  
Not shown around like your golden prize  
Oh, I looked around,  
Look what happened, you found out  
You never satisfy me  
  
Never trusted anyone in the first place,  
You turned me up, your disgusting anyway  
Hear that music, crank it up,  
Is there something familiar in the singer's voice  
Turn it down, now listen to me,  
What made you think you were my authority  
I'm awake, finally now I'm able to move on (just gotta tell the truth)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now do these words stick to you, hope they do  
Think about it, think about it  
Stick to you like superglue, keep you from the things you do  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus 2x]


Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh, what a life  
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were  
Oh, you and I  
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money  
What a lie, you and I  
  
[Chorus]  
What about your  
Your 10,000 promises?  
That you gave to me  
Your 10,000 promises  
That you promised me  
  
Once I could handle the truth  
When the truth was you and I  
But time after time all the  
Promises turned out to be all lies  
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money  
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)  
You and I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said "I'll take you back"  
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want  
10,000 more  
Oh  
  
10,000 promises yeah (oh)  
10,000 promises you gave to me  
  
Repeat chorus  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me (That you gave to me)  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me  
Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh you and I  
What a lie


I don't know what he does to make you cry,  
But I'll be there to make you smile.  
I don't have a fancy car,  
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles.  
I don't care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know  
But if you were my girl  
I'd make it so we'd never be apart.  
  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you, but  
Love is all I have to give  
  
When you talk-does it seem like he's not  
Even listening to a word you say?  
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems  
I'll try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most?  
Does his friends get all your time?  
Baby please, I'm on my knees  
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!!  
  
To you, hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more-inside  
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love  
I have inside, I Love You  
  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give  
Everything I have is for you  
But love is all I have to give


I don't know what he does to make you cry  
But I'll be there to make you smile  
I don't have a fancy car  
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles  
I don't care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart?  
I don't know, but if you were my girl  
I'd make it so we'd never be apart  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give  
When you talk, does it seem like he's not  
Even listenin' to a word you say?  
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems  
I'll try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most?  
Does his friends get all your time?  
Baby please, I'm on my knees  
Prayin' for the day that you'll be mine  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside, oh  
All the money in the world could never add up to  
All the love I have inside, I love you, baby  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give  
All everything I have is for you  
You've got what I got, you you  
What I need, my love is all I have to give  
All that I have is for you  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  
I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
Give the world to you lady  
But love is all I have to give  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  


All In This Together  
  
Let me tell you what I see through my eyes  
Apathy is all around and on the rise  
We channel so much energy through our greed  
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools  
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do  
We compromise our liberties for security  
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Don't throw in the towel  
Let's overcome the test for now  
Together (together) we last, divided we fall  
Love will conquer all  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you)  
Living is more than profits accrued  
(We gotta change, we gotta change right now)  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together


I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
  
I'd walk halfway around the world  
For just one kiss from you  
Far beyond the call of love  
The sun, the stars, the moon  
As long as your love's there to lead me  
I won't lose my way believe me  
Even through the darkest night you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Your love as far as I can see  
Is all I'm ever gonna need  
There's one thing for sure  
I know it's true  
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you  
  
I used to think that dreams were just  
For sentimental fools  
And I'd never find someone  
Who'd give their love so true  
But I knew the very minute  
Couldn't live my life without you in it  
And now I want the whole world  
To know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus: x2]


There's a spark of magic in your eyes  
And Candyland appears each time you smile  
Never thought that fairytales came true  
But they come true, when I'm near you  
Your a genie in disguise  
Full of wonder and surprise  
  
And, Betcha by golly Wow!  
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever  
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong  
  
Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words  
To express all he feels inside  
But ever just so often  
The words of another, who's truly in love  
Seem to work our just fine  
  
To say I love you  
To say.....  
I love you  
  
Keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong


As I was walking down a  
Path in the woods one day I  
Came across a vision that caught my eye  
  
There was a lady standing  
Right there beside a well, and I heard her whisper  
What you wish for you can have  
  
Then the vision went away  
I thought that I had lost her  
The girl I had been waiting for  
I can't believe I just saw her  
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine  
Now I want her next to me, cause I want, cause I want more  
Whoahhhh  
  
Chorus  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and  
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, the last thing I see at night  
You know if I could have all that  
That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her  
This girl is the only one  
I cannot deny her  
She's making love to my mind  
And I can't forget this feeling  
It's her voice that's calling  
It's her voice I need  
Whoahhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I need  
Come back to me now  
Cinderella  
  
(Chorus Fade)


Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I woke up this mornin'  
From a dream  
That you were saying goodbye  
We had a simple argument  
But not enough to keep out  
Each other's life  
  
I want to be happy  
But I can't be happy  
If I can't be with you  
'Cause you're my baby  
My sweet honey  
And no other girl will do  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I can't seem to figure out  
Just what went wrong with us  
You must've thought I was selfish  
But everything I did I did for us  
  
I want to be happy  
But I can't be happy  
If I can't be with you  
'Cause you're my baby  
My sweet honey  
And no other girl will do  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I can't eat or even sleep  
Till I have you  
Back inside my world  
My life won't be complete  
Unless you stay my girl  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
Come on girl let me break it down  
  
Don't leave me girl  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
Don't go  
  
Don't leave me (I don't want to let you go)  
'Cause you need me (I don't want to be alone)  
I never want to be without you (I never want to be alone)  
Don't leave me (Oh baby I need to be)  
'Cause you need me (In your life)  
I never want to be without you (Girl, I'll never let you go)  
  
Don't leave me girl  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
Don't go


[Chorus]  
Everybody  
Rock your body  
Everybody  
Rock your body right  
Backstreet's Back alright  
  
Hey, hey yeah, well,  
Oh my god we're back again

[Chorus]  
  
Now throw your hands up in the air  
Wave them around like you just don't care  
If you want to party let me hear you yell  
Cause we got it goin' on again  
  
Am I original?

[Chorus]  
  
So everybody everywhere  
Don't be afraid  
Don't have no fear  
I'm gonna tell the world  
Make you understand  
As long as there be music  
We'll be comin' back again  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Listen girl, I don't know where to start  
Cause every word I say is straight from the heart  
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you  
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through  
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance,  
Cause I want you back again  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I close my eyes,I see your face and I wonder  
When you close your eyes do you think about me?  
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're all that I see.  
  
You and I we shared enough together  
Each other was all we'd ever need  
I thought that you would stay with me forever  
But I took for granted the love you gave to me  
But I'll keep on trying, till the end  
Baby I need you back with me  
I need you back,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And girl I'm going out of my mind  
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do  
Please say its just a matter of time,  
Until I feel your touch,  
Until you let me come back to you  
  
I think about you girl every time at night  
I'm in love, and it feels so right  
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain  
I was just caught up in the lying game  
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways  
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days  
Until you let me come back,  
Until you let me start  
To find a new way to get back into your heart.  
  
[Chorus]


Oh oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh oh,  
Oh,  
Yeah,  
  
You had me waitin even on the second date,  
I picked you up I took you to your favourite place,  
I saw you flirtin but I looked the other way,  
Away, away, away, hey,  
  
You pulled me up and said you had a place to go,  
Just grabbed my keys, you took my car and stole my phone,  
I know I shouldn't but I let you get away,  
Away, away, away,  
  
But I'm not a player,  
I'm not a clown,  
I wont be a puppet,  
Just hangin around,  
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,  
And let you take his car,  
I found out who you are,  
I finally figured you out,  
  
Oh no,  
I shouldve seen it comin you were just pretend,  
You just took my credit card and maxed it til the end,  
I wish I'd known before I hit the atm,  
Oh no,  
It happened again,  
(Oh yeah)  
  
I'm not a player,  
I'm not a clown,  
I wont be a puppet,  
Just hangin around,  
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,  
And let you take his car,  
I found out who you are,  
I finally figured (I figured you out),  
I finally figured (oh figured you out),  
I finally figured (oh yeah) you out,

So long, so long,  
Farewell,  
  
(Cause) I'm not a player,

Backstreet  
Check it uh  
Hey  
  
Let's talk about one, baby  
You gotta hear me out  
Did you really think I'd be the last to know  
What it's all about  
  
Let's talk about you  
You say  
He's the essence of your life  
But he'll eat you up from inside slow  
And then he doesn't want to know  
  
I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside  
And then he doesn't want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen I mean it  
There's nothin' that he's worthy of  
He's just another player  
Playing in the name of love  
I've seen enough  
Now this must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)  
To become your number one  
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses  
That turn you on  
I've seen it before (dont take!)  
Anymore, free too  
You're through for sure  
Just go get on with your life  
Stop acting like you've given up  
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life  
Stop acting like you've given up  
  
Listen I mean it (I mean it)  
There's nothin' that he's worthy of  
He's just another player (player)  
Playing in the name of love  
I've seen enough  
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)  
Get another boyfriend  
  
All right  
Yeah  
Get another boyfriend  
Stop  
Hey  
  
Hear me out  
You must know (you must know)  
What it's all about (baby)  
That he's just a player in love (love)  
This must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
[Chorus: x2]


It's in the silences, the words you never say  
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way  
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up  
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware  
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are  
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?  
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything that I am  
Oh, there are no guarantees  
That's what you always say to me  
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch  
But what I'm trying to say to you  
I've never said to anyone  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
You're everything I am  
With everything I am  


The very first time  
That I saw your brown eyes  
Your lips said hello and I said hi  
I knew right then you were the one  
But I was caught up  
In physical attraction  
But to my satisfaction  
Baby you were more than just a face  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
Oh, yeah, the very next time shell be my friend  
  
If I say that I will be your one and only  
(promise, promise) promise that you'll never leave me lonely  
I just wanna be the one you need  
Oh, baby  
I just wanna be the one who serves you  
Sometime I feel as if I don't deserve you  
I cherish every moment that we share  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
(repeat)  
Very next time she will be my friend  
Someone who I can believe in  
  
(my friend)  
I need someone wholl be my friend  
(my friend)  
To be with me through thick and thin  
(my friend)  
Please share my love with me my friend  
I need someone like you  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you


You've got me wide open,  
Wide open, now I'm yours  
You found me heartbroken  
Heartbroken, on the floor  
Became my salvation  
Salvation through the war, yeah  
You got me wide open  
Wide open, now I'm sure  
  
In a world like this where some back down  
I, I, know we're gonna make it  
In a time like this where love comes 'round  
I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you  
  
And now I'm free falling,  
Free falling, in your eyes  
You got me still calling,  
Still calling, no surprise  
I never knew I could love 'til the  
End of time, yeah  
And now I'm free falling,  
Free falling by your side  
  
In a world like this where some back down  
I, I, know we're gonna make it  
In a time like this where love comes 'round  
I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you  
  
Yeah  
In a world like this  
  
You got me wide open,  
Wide open, yeah  
And now I'm free falling  
Free falling  
  
Hey, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah  
In a world like  
In a world like 'cause I got you  
In a world like this  
  
In a world like this where some back down  
I, I, know we're gonna make it  
In a time like this where love comes 'round  
I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you


Away  
Internationally  
Away  
  
Chorus:  
Away  
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go  
Girl I want you in a plane in a seat right next to mine  
Get witchu right after my shows  
Baby I could give you ways  
Come on girl, lets fly  
Away  
Internationally  
  
Now I don't usually meet under these circumstances, but...  
You're like the perfect girl with the perfect skin, so...  
I'm just too scared to know that I'm gonna leave without you girl [?]  
  
You can call me a man  
  
Bridge 1:  
Because I know  
That this aint the kind of love that could just take  
One night and then it's over  
Girl I know  
I aint never fell in love so quickly  
Baby please come with me  
All you need is my love in a bag  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl I can think of only one and no one else and dance to you  
Were like the perfect team  
No matter where I go you gotta roll  
I bet they know about you and I'm not leaving without you girl [?]  
  
And I don't need to read your mind  
  
Bridge 2:  
Because I know  
That you want to see the world  
And I could say that all I need is  
One night and then well be closer  
And I know  
I aint never fell in love so quickly  
Baby please come with me  
All you need is my love in a bag


Looking at your picture from when we first met  
You gave me a smile that I could never forget  
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night  
  
Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind  
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night  
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go  
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end  
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me  
But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead  
And deep inside I wish it's me instead  
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away  
  
I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go  
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end  
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me  
But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
That since I lost you, I lost myself  
No I can't fake it, there's no one else  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Something about the way you moved  
That caught my eye  
I really did have to try it  
I can't deny it  
The way your body swings  
As I watched you from behind  
That got me so excited  
How could I fly in  
Baby let me be the on to hold you  
To give you the things I know you need  
You know that we can wait another life time  
And we can never find a love just like this  
  
[Chorus]  
If you lay down lay down beside me  
You can get on inside me  
And I can get on inside you too  
If you lay down lay down beside me  
You can wake up beside me, forever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever, baby  
  
Let's take this chance to get to know each other better  
Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers  
I give you what you need  
Just come to me and get it  
Baby you won't regret it  
  
No, no, no baby  
Baby move a little closer, yeah  
I want to feel your body next to mine  
And before this night is over  
You will know what I need  
Talking love in your sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tonight, (tonight) we'll find  
Just what what we've been looking for  
Good, good lovin' and a whole lot more  
Hold on  
Be inside  
Hold me and don't you let go  
Until I tell you to  
  
[Chorus]


I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
Here's to us, girl, you and I  
May our love last 'til eternity  
The love we have can touch the sky  
It's just enough love for you and me  
  
Now we've been blessed (we've been blessed)  
With happiness (with happiness)  
Your love came from up above  
So we'll always stay together  
We must keep that forever  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
We sip the champagne as a symbol of love  
We want everyone to know just how much  
Made a vow, to one another  
You'll always be my lady, and I'll always be your man  
As we sit at the table, reserved for two  
All this love, girl, and it's only me and you  
It's so amazing another can rely  
Stars fill the sky, the night is so right  
  
We've been blessed (we've been blessed)  
With happiness (with happiness)  
Your love came from up above  
So we'll always stay together  
We must keep that forever  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love


Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up. Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up...  
  
When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul  
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control  
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know  
You still care for me, say a prayer for me, and I know  
  
Oooh, I like you hangin' around  
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Oooh, you are my favorite sound  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day  
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load  
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity  
Would you hold my hand?  
Say you understand my pain  
  
Oooh, I like you hangin' around  
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Oooh, you are my favorite sound  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
It's been a long hard road, and it's only just begun, my friend  
And this I know  
You helped me carry the load  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
Well, you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I don't wanna let you go  
'Cause you lift me up now  
Well, you're always around..  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up now  
You lift me up  
Lift me up now  
Yeah, you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
  
Lift me up


If I could right the wrongs that made you cry  
I make a promise not to say good-night  
"Cause I'm holding on  
With a love so strong  
And I can't take a day without you by my side  
  
Girl if i could change  
If I could change your mind  
Baby you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl don't stop  
The sun from shining down on me  
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile  
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me  
The I might break down and cry just like a child  
  
Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free  
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me  
So I'm pressin' on  
I hope you understand  
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands  
  
So if I could change  
And it won't hurt your pride  
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a child  
Just like a child  
With the spirits running free  
She showed my why  
Oh, she did  
  
Like a child(oh baby)  
Just like a child  
Think of what our love could be  
If our hearts could set us free  
Like a child  
  
[Chorus]


Oh no  
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath  
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh  
I made a promise to myself last night  
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I lose it all  
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall  
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing  
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it  
I lose it all, if I lose it all  
  
Wouldn't matter anyway  
  
Don't change a thing  
Perfect as you are  
Time has a way  
Time is all I've got  
If my heart should shatter watching you  
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we will be waiting when I fall into your open arms  
I believe you'll find me there  
You'll find me there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Wouldn't matter anyway

Once there was a time love was just a myth  
It just wasn't for real, didn't exist  
Til the day you came into my life  
You forced me to think twice  
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich  
Gave me belief someday I'd be more than this  
That's why until this day I'm still your man  
Cause you made me understand that  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair  
The two of us but no one there  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
You're my secret place where I can be myself  
You connect with me like nobody else  
Even though our circumstances changed  
Our love still remains  
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly  
You taught me to be patient, I taught you to rely  
So no matter what tomorrow brings  
We got the simple things cause (noooo)  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (bean bag chair)  
The two of us but no one there (no one there)  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs (ohh)  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (ohh)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane (ohh)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is  
A Sunday morning with the blanket wrapped around your waist  
Love is  
The way your lips seem to curve  
When you say my name (say my name ohh)  
Love is  
And when I'm stressing like the world's turning upside down  
Girl it all makes sense when you're around  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (yeah)  
The two of us but no one there (making love is)  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane (I'm gonna keep you baby)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (bag chair)  
The two of us but no one there  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (I've got you baby)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is (baby)  
The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is  
Waking up to see your face (say I've got you)  
Kissing in the morning rain (ooh)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you


[Brian:]  
I won't tell nobody  
I'll just scream it in my mind  
Nothing good in life is scripted  
It's not like we predicted  
That the one you want  
Is gonna be the one you thought  
  
[Nick:]  
I won't tell nobody  
But I won't live like a prisoner  
Nothing has to be so perfect  
Can you tell me was it worth it  
Because her heart can't lie  
And even though her face may try  
Love can keep you up all night  
  
[Chorus (mainly Nick):]  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[Brian:]  
If I don't tell a living soul  
Still everyone would know  
Yes they would  
It's always three am somewhere  
You know it when you get there  
  
[AJ:]  
Some people try to cover it up  
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)  
  
[Chorus (mainly AJ):]  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[Nick:]  
I don't mean to scare you  
But everybody has a first time  
One day when you're old and gray  
Don't look back and never say  
You should have tried  
Stayed up all night  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
  
[AJ:]  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
  
[All:]  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
To the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[AJ:]  
Love will keep you up all night


I can see that you've been crying  
You can't hide it with a lie  
What's the use in you denying  
That what you have is wrong  
I heard him promise you forever  
But forever's come and gone  
Baby, he would say whatever  
It takes to keep you blind  
To the truth between the lines, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I will love you more than that  
I won't say the words  
Then take them back  
Don't give loneliness a chance  
Baby listen to me when I say  
  
I will love you more than that  
  
Baby, you deserve much better  
What's the use in holding on  
Don't you see it's now or never  
'Cause I just can't be friends  
Baby knowing in the end, that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's not a day that passes by  
I don't wonder why we haven't tried  
It's not too late to change your mind  
So take my hand, don't say goodbye  
  
I will love you more than that  
I won't say the words  
Then take them back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will love you more than that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will love you more than that


Looking for beauty in a certain  
Finding the strength inside a gray  
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown  
And maybe that's ok  
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life  
Maybe I need to get a grip  
Cause you're the only one  
That makes me feel like this  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
Save me I'm falling again  
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces  
In the end no matter what I do  
There's nowhere, nowhere to go  
  
Nowhere to go but you  
  
Tryin' to make nothing out of something  
Promise myself I wouldn't care  
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here  
You finally crackin' my resistance  
And find a way to wear me down  
  
Yea, I just look at you  
And there's no way out  
  
Every single road I take (it's you)  
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you)  
And it's too late for anyone to save me  
  
I'm falling again  
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Nowhere to go but you


[Nick:]  
Stop it, stop it  
Stop it, stop it  
Go, stop and go  
I just hit static  
I used to read you  
Loud and clear  
Not like this  
It's so erratic  
  
[Brian:]  
And I'm not rational  
When I see you around  
Your inconsistency  
And you know it's dragging me down  
You're so conflicted baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're always walking away  
One step and everything's over  
And you're running back to me  
You say I let you down  
Baby take me in or just take me out  
I'm already dead  
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry  
  
[Nick:]  
Stop it  
I've made mistakes  
I've been an addict  
A blind fanatic  
Don't you know  
You're not immune to the panic  
With somebody  
  
[Brian:]  
When the snow hits your skin  
The cold don't last forever  
But you're livin' again  
If you don't let seasons change  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[AJ:]  
How many times do I have to say it  
Before you believe me  
  
[Nick:]  
Stop it, stop it  
Stop and go  
  
[All:] Panic!  
  
[Repeat Chorus]


Yeah yeah yeah  
Julie was a long way from home  
She can make alone look pretty  
Her attitude made a part of her landscape  
Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise  
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)  
  
Julie likes to shop lift in stores  
Right alongside the rich and famous  
Get in elevators, press emergency stop  
And make love on the floor until the camera made us  
  
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire  
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,  
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Tell me what you want from me  
I've got everything you need  
It's getting hard for me to breathe  
Let me be your guarantee  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Right now, right now  
Right now, oh oh oh  
Poster girl  
Poster girl  
Come on, come on


Baby, oh  
  
Even in my heart I see  
You're not bein' true to me  
Deep within my soul I feel  
Nothing's like it used to be  
  
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time  
Impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
Before you tear us apart (my heart)  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
I should've known from the start  
You know you got to stop (from my heart)  
You're tearing us apart (my heart)  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
I live my life the way  
To keep you comin' back to me  
Everything I do is for you  
So what is it that you can't see  
  
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time  
Impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
You better quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Baby, baby the love that we had was so strong  
Don't leave me hangin' here forever  
Oh baby, baby this is not right, let's stop this tonight  
  
Baby, (oh) quit playin' games  
Baby  
  
Sometimes I wish I could  
Turn back time, impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
Baby  
  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
(my heart)  
Baby (my heart)  
  
With my heart


[Nick:]  
Ooh  
How many times am I gonna let you walk right past  
I swear sometimes I think I'm moving too fast  
You never know if it's gonna last  
I guess that's what scares me sometimes  
  
[Brian:]  
Ooh  
I know it ain't right but I don't wanna let me care  
I wanna know love but I'm a little scared  
You never know what you're gonna get  
And that is what scares me sometimes, times  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
[Aj:]  
Yeah  
I don't hurt people that don't hurt me back, yeah  
I turned to war and I'm so tired of that (Mhmm)  
I'm ready to walk my guides down  
I'm done playing tough guy for now, for now  
  
[Aj:]  
Everybody deserves taking chances  
And that only flies in certain circumstances  
Can't keep running away from these feelings  
Everybody needs someone sometimes  
Sometime  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
[Howie:]  
And before this moment fades away  
I wanted you to know I made mistakes  
But even if there's no more words to say  
I tried to be better without you  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
Oh


Roll with it  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
If you ever feel like no one cares  
When you try your best but you get nowhere  
Don't give in  
'Cause the times will come again  
When they criticize every move you make  
And you've had as much as you're gonna take  
Don't you worry  
Soon enough things will change  
  
Bridge  
  
And when it seems as though  
Nobody understands a man  
(understands)  
Don't let your head hang down  
You want to just stick to the plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Just roll, roll, roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
Just roll with it  
Everything will be fine  
Just roll with it  
It's gonna be alright  
Just roll with it  
Don't put yourself down  
Just roll with it  
  
If you just can't find someone to trust  
When you give your heart but you don't get much  
Don't you worry the time is gonna come  
  
The world's a school  
So much to learn  
So learn it well  
The world's a stage  
So act the fool  
No woman understands  
You've got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Everybody just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Come on now  
Just roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Just roll with it  
Backstreet says  
Roll with it  
Come on y'all  
Roll with it  
  
All the fellas roll  
Roll with it  
All the ladies roll  
Roll with it  
Everybody roll  
You've got to roll with it  
Just roll  
Roll with it  
Just roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
You've got to  
You've got to  
You've got to  
Roll  
  
Everybody  
Anybody  
Everybody roll with it  
Everybody  
Anybody  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll


You washed away my sad face  
And flooded all my empty space  
You take away life's heartbreak  
And I know with you it's gonna be okay  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you are rushed over me yeah  
  
There's no more blindness  
When I cry, I'm smiling  
You kept me from dying  
And I know with you I'll keep on living  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you are rushed over me  
  
It's not enough  
Just holding on  
Before I met you  
I was lost  
Now that you're standing here  
I don't want you to go  
'Cause I know, that your love keeps me alive  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you have rushed over me  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you have rushed over me


Yeah, yeah  
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do"  
And after all this time my heart still burns for you  
If you don't know by now that you're my only one  
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone  
  
I know I promised you forever  
Is there no stronger word I can use  
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
Can you see me, here I am  
I need you like I needed you then  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
You see colors no one else can see  
In every breath you hear a symphony  
You understand me like nobody can  
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming  
  
When this whole world gets too crazy  
And there's nowhere left to go  
I know you give me sanctuary  
You're the only truth I know  
You're the road back home  
  
Can you see me, here I am  
Standing here where I've always been  
And when words are not enough  
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine  
You're my safest place to hide  
My safest place to hide  
  
I know I promised you forever  
There's no stronger word I can use  
To reassure when the storm is raging outside  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
Oh! Can you see me, here I am  
Standing here where I've always been  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart I'd still find  
Yeah, yeah  
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah  
You're my safest place to hide


Here I am again  
Waiting on the moment you decide  
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere  
I?ve been so close to you so many times  
I feel like I could drown  
I wish that I could fly away from here  
All:  
But I?m still coming down  
AJ:  
From the last time  
All:  
That you came around  
AJ:  
In the starlight  
All:  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night  
Like a lonely satellite  
AJ:  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
We walked on Jupiter  
Flew around the moon a time or two  
Left a mark on every star we could find  
But now I?m burning like a meteor  
That never hits the ground  
Wish that I could fly away from you  
All:  
But I?m still coming down  
AJ:  
From the last time  
All:  
That you came around  
AJ:  
In the starlight  
All:  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
Love is poisoning the atmosphere  
Is keeping everything unclear to me  
Howie:  
Something in your eyes  
Never satisfies  
I?m feeling so alone, tonight  
All:  
But I?m still coming down (still coming down)  
From the last time (the last time)  
That you came around (you came around)  
In the starlight (the starlight)  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity (ooooh)  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night (falling through the night)  
Yes I?m falling through the night (falling through the night)  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
Like a lonely satellite  


Oh  
Oh  
Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh no  
Yeah  
  
Shorty ain't got cable,  
She ain't even got a radio, way more than able.  
What kinda girl should I take her for?  
The perfect kind, just what I like,  
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream  
She's a dream, yeah  
  
Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.  
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,  
I'm first class every flight.  
If she takes the time to open her eyes,  
She can realize that she's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
  
'Cause Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
But Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
That's why I make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
  
Shorty don't know who I am  
  
And I'm cool with that, if she says so  
I ain't even got a lot to her  
And when I'm out making pesos?  
Ain't' nobody treat her like I do her.  
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,  
The only one on her mind,  
She's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
And Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,  
Like three or four times a week  
She don't even know I've been around the world  
And all the different girls I meet.  
But there's just one, face that I see  
She's the only one for me  
She's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
  
'Cuase Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
That's why I make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
(She's a dream)  
  
See, shorty don't know who I am  
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,  
It's not good to fuss  
And I know she loves me, for me  
And I love her, for her  
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave  
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me  
  
She don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
Oh,  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
  
'Bout me  
(She's a dream)


[Chorus]  
You're my shining star  
That is what you are  
There is no one like you baby  
Angels everywhere  
Every time you're near  
You will always be my baby  
  
Baby when you do the things you do  
I want to be close to you  
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh  
Baby I can never say how much  
I need your touch, I can't get enough  
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby you're as close as close can get  
And baby you know I'd let  
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah  
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring  
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms  
Cause you know what to do to turn me on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've never been so satisfied  
With anything in my entire life  
Cause you are doing everything so right  
Oh, oh baby  
I've never been so satisfied  
With anything in my entire life  
Cause you are doing everything so right  
Oh, oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know that I adore you  
want to be there everyday for you  
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby  
You know that I adore you  
want to be there everyday for you  
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]


Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,  
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,  
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,  
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,  
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,  
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it  
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,  
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.  
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,  
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,  
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,  
We gotta rearrange and flip the page,  
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,  
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,  
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive  
Peace of mind's so hard to find.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now  
  
Problems, complications and accusations  
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces  
A war is taking place.  
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace  
Is increasing the height of your spirituality.  
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions  
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.  
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,  
But will we live to see the dawn.  
  
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be  
Is a living hell torturing our minds.  
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,  
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.  
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now


When you come back I won't be here  
She said and gently pulled me near  
If you want to talk you can call  
I know it's not your fault  
  
I just smiled and said let go of me  
But there's something that I've just gotta know  
Did someone else steal my part?  
She said it's not my fault  
  
Then my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
I was drifted in between  
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah  
In my dreams you are still here  
Like you've always been  
  
Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
I gave myself away completely  
But you just couldn't see me  
Though I was sleeping in your bed  
'Cause someone else was on your mind  
In your head  
  
When I came back she wasn't there  
Just a note left on the stairs  
If you want to talk give me a call  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
When the one that you want doesn't want you  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
Siberia, Siberia  
When the one you want doesn't want you too


Here we are, seven days  
And seven nights of empty tries  
It's ritual, habitual  
But it's never gonna work this time  
  
We're to the point of no return  
And along the way the only thing we've learned  
Is how to hurt each other  
  
I'm looking back and wondering why  
It took so long to realize  
That nothing's changed, it never will  
All these years of standing still  
And still we stay in all this pain  
And nothing's gonna make it go away  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
  
So save your voice  
Don't waste your breath  
Can't you see we're at the end  
And this goodbye is permanent  
So wish me well and try to forget  
  
And all the fights  
And all the ways  
We almost made it  
But we never did  
And it's finally come to this  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
  
We can not hide what we've become  
So sick and tired of being numb  
It's done, it's done  
It's done  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
'Cause I know, I know, I know  
'Cause I know, 'cause I know


Here we are in the arms of one another  
And we still go on searching for each other  
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is  
right for us tonight  
  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
I know the reason why I am alive  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a place I've never been  
And it comes from deep within  
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize  
Knowing all I have to do  
Is reach out my hand to you  
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes  
  
Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers  
Who believe that we see no wall between us  
How can they be in my heart and in my mind,  
when all I could find  
  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
I know the reason why I am alive  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I loved you from a distance  
Thought I couldn't reach that far  
I can't believe how close that we are  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]


How come you never know  
What you got until it's gone  
Too bad  
Because I never felt so good with anyone  
How fooled was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
  
So every day I try a little harder  
To forget her  
Lie here convince myself  
Tomorrow will be better  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
Love is what the trouble is  
Love is what the trouble is  
  
How come she said  
You never wear your heart  
Where I can see  
Too bad  
'Cause now I'm the one  
Who's sorry  
How stupid was I into thinking  
I was gonna be alright  
Okay  
Fine  
So everyday I find a little something  
To remind me  
No matter how I try  
I can't put the past behind me  
  
The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory  
And now I know what it is  
  
Love has let me go  
I'm alright, I'm okay  
I'll be fine, give it time  
  
But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone (she's gone)  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)  
And now I know what it is (yes I do)  
And now I know what it is  
'Cause love is what the trouble is  
The trouble  
Love, love is what the trouble is


Uh, uh I know that you're hurting now  
Seems like there's just no way how  
Feels like it's all gone wrong  
You keep on sipping till you can't go on!  
Don't worry, I'm not by your side  
  
My shoulder is yours if you need to cry  
Feel the times when life is just too much  
I know you want to, but don't give up!  
  
Try, baby try  
Give me a moment of your time  
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes  
I know you're hurt now  
We can work it out  
If we just try, if you just try!  
It's always been just me and you  
You know I've been down there, too!  
Always when I needed you  
You were strong!  
Let me hold you, baby  
When hope is gone!  
  
Try, baby try  
Give me a moment of your time  
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes  
I know you're hurt now  
We can work it out  
If we just try, if you just try!  
Holding on, holding on  
We used to know how to!  
Oh, oh, oh if the nights are so long  
It's my favorite time if we just  
  
Try, baby try  
Give me a moment of your time  
Oh no, don't, don't close your eyes  
I know you're hurt now  
We can work it out  
If we just try, if you just try!

Anytime, anywhere, anyplace  
You could be anyone today  
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street  
  
[AJ:]  
Maybe you'll take me by surprise  
Will you be the one I had in mind  
  
[Chorus (emphasis on AJ):]  
There'll come a day  
When you'll walk out of my dreams  
Face to face  
Like I'm imagining  
Baby how can I be sure  
That you're the one I'm waiting for  
Will you be unmistakable  
  
[AJ:]  
Unmistakable  
  
[Nick:]  
People say we're watching our lives  
Through a glass  
Desperately waiting on a chance  
I know you're out there  
Holding on, holding out for me  
  
[AJ:]  
How are we to know the time is right  
What if you're here and I'm just blind  
  
[Repeat Chorus (emphasis on Nick)]  
  
[Nick:]  
How can I know a song I never heard  
How will I know your voice  
When you haven't said a word  
  
[AJ:]  
How do I know how this will end  
Before we begin  
  
[Nick:]  
Before we begin  
  
[Howie:]  
There'll come a day  
When you walk out of my dreams  
  
[All:]  
Face to face (face to face)  
Like I'm imagining (Like I'm imagining)  
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)  
That you're the one I'm waiting for (You're the one I'm waiting for)  
Will you be (will you be)  
Will you be (will you be)  
  
[AJ:]  
Unmistakable  
Unmistakable


(Weird world, weird world)  
Hey hey hey  
  
There's silence over the city but it's so noisy  
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down  
You see I've got to catch a plane, won't buy a ticket  
Cause it's hard to stop when you're spinning around  
  
It's a weird world don't you know it  
It's a weird world and it won't slow down  
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
There's a way, just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love  
It's a weird world, yea  
  
Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert  
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn  
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby  
He's out there taking them on  
  
It's a weird world and I know you know it  
It's a weird world and it won't slow down  
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
There's a way, just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love  
  
I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see  
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me  
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you  
'Cause you're part of this place  
But if I die, don't let them take away your beautiful smile  
Take away your beautiful smile  
Take away your beautiful smile  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
There's a way just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey sweet baby  
There's a way for you to decide it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love  
  
(Hey hey hey)  
It's a weird world don't you know it?  
(Hey hey hey)  
It's a weird world don't you know it?  
(Hey hey hey)  
It's a weird world don't you know it?  
Hey hey hey


Why you keep on callin' me  
When you know we'll never be  
'Cause you got someone on the side  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I said hey girl  
Did you hear me?  
I said hey girl  
Why are you callin' now?

Don't try to play me for a fool

Why you keep on callin' me girl  
I said stop callin' me  
Why you keep on callin' me  
When you know we'll never be  
'Cause you got someone on the side  
Keep thinking that were gonna be  
So you keep on callin' me  
But you got someone on the side  
  
Hey girl is he really good?  
Does he do ya real good?  
How's he doin now

How can he be better than me?  
How can he be better than me?  
  
Why you keep on callin' me  
Girl I said stop callin' me

Why you keep on callin' me  
When you know we'll never be  
'Cause you got someone on the side  
Keep thinking that were gonna be  
So you keep on callin' me  
But you got someone on the side  
  
I thought it was love  
That you came from above  
Damn, how could I be so wrong?  
I said get off my back


I open my eyes  
I see your face  
I cannot hide, I can't erase  
The way you make me feel inside  
You complete me  
Girl that's why  
  
Somethin' about you makes me feel  
Baby my heart wants to reveal  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm asking you  
These three words I want to hear from you  
  
[Chorus]  
Yes I will  
Take your hand and walk with you  
Yes I will  
It's these three words that promise to  
Yes I will  
Give you everything you need  
And someday start a family with you  
Yes I will  
Take your hand and walk with you  
Yes I will  
Baby I promise you  
Yes I will  
Give you everything you need  
And someday start a family with you (a family)  
Oh yes I will (oh baby)  
  
This is no ordinary love  
And I can never have enough (I can't enough of)  
Of all the things you've given to me  
You're my heart, my soul, my everything  
  
Every night I thank you lord (I thank you lord)  
For giving me the strength  
To love her more and more  
Each day I promise her  
As long as I hear those three words  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I stand beside you  
In everything you do (yes I do)  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Baby I'll be there  
Oh baby I'll be there (I'll be there for you)  
  
As God as my witness (God as my witness)  
I will carry this through (I will carry this through)  
To kept to what's promised  
What's promised to you  
(I promised you)

Yes I will (oh yeah)  
Yes I will (oh yeah)  
Yes I will  
I promise you  
That everything's gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)  
I will


When I first met you  
My life turned a page  
Chapter one was how true love was made  
You taught me with your kiss  
Things about romance I missed  
You knew everything from A to Z  
What pleases you and what pleases me  
Girl when you touched me  
I began to understand, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you wrote the book on love  
And I want to read every word  
So I know everything about you  
You, you wrote the book on love  
Girl I just can't get enough of your love  
I know you wrote the book on love  
  
Each time I hold you I find something new  
Cause I know what I love about you, baby  
Girl I discover you bring out the lover in me, yeah  
You're like a fire that burns in my soul  
Like a volcano, I'm ready to blow  
Cause every time I look at you  
I feel love I can't explain,oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear what your heart is saying to me  
I see the picture so clearly  
I'm thirsty for the knowledge  
True love brings  
What you're near me  
  
[Chorus]


Sometimes I blend in like a book on a shelf [book on a shelf]  
Sometimes I wear my jeans like anyone else [anyone else]  
There's millions of chameleons blending in all around  
Sometimes I wanna be found  
  
'Cause there is so much more to me  
More than I could ever show  
If you wanna fly with me  
There is one thing I gotta know  
  
Can you keep a secret, secret  
Ah oh oh  
Ah oh oh  
Can you keep a secret, secret  
[Ahoohoh]  
Ah oh oh  
Ah oh oh  
A secret!  
  
Sometimes what you see is not what you get [not what you get]  
Sometimes you haven't seen anything yet [anything yet]  
I'm not the same old melody that everyone sings [that everyone sings]  
Can't you tell I'm hiding my wings?  
  
'Cause there is so much more to me  
More than I could ever show  
If you wanna fly with me  
There is one thing I gotta know [gotta know]  
  
Can you keep a secret,  
[There's more to me] secret [more than the eye can see] ah oh oh  
[I just can't wait to show it] ah oh oh  
Can you keep a secret, [a mystery] secret [a secret identity] ah oh oh  
[This is magic and you know it] ah oh oh  
A secret!  
  
Come with me and you'll see a world beyond your dreams  
More than it seems [a world beyond your dreams]  
Come with me and you'll see that you can fly [you can fly]  
Like me!  
  
Can you keep a secret, [there's more to me] secret [more than the eye can  
See]  
Ah oh oh [I just can't wait to show it] ah oh oh  
Can you keep a secret, [a mystery] secret [a secret identity] ah oh oh  
[This is magic and you know it] ah oh oh  
  
[6 times]


Blindfolded on this carriage ride  
That they call life  
Keep tryin' to make it through that next turn  
Knuckles white and holdin' tight  
  
So here I go, taking the curve  
But I know that I'm never alone  
I think of you and how you never let me go  
  
I feel connected (connected)  
Protected (protected)  
It's like you're sitting right  
With me all the time  
You hear me (you hear me)  
You're near me (you're near me)  
And everything else is gonna be all right  
  
'Cause nothin' can break this  
Nothin' can break this  
Nothin' can break this tie  
Connected  
  
Connected inside  
  
It's not an accident  
The time we spend apart  
But now we're so close  
That I can always find you  
Right here in my heart  
  
You've given me  
Something I need  
And I don't ever want it to end  
Because of you  
I know I've found my strength again  
  
I feel connected (connected)  
Protected (protected)  
It's like you're sitting right  
With me all the time  
You hear me (you hear me)  
You're near me (you're near me)  
And everything else is gonna be all right  
  
'Cause nothin' can break this  
Nothin' can break this  
Nothin' can break this tie  
Connected  
  
Connected inside  
  
Every time that I breathe  
I can feel the energy  
Reachin' out, flowing through  
You to me and me to you  
Wake or dream  
Walk or stand  
You are everywhere I am  
Separate souls  
Unified  
Touchin' at the speed of life  
  
  
I feel connected (connected)  
Protected (protected)  
It's like you're sitting right  
With me all the time  
You hear me (you hear me)  
You're near me (you're near me)  
And everything else is gonna be all right  
  
Connected (connected)  
Protected (protected)  
It's like you're sitting right  
With me all the time  
You hear me (you hear me)  
You're near me (you're near me)

'Cause nothin' can break this  
Nothin' can break this  
Nothin' can break this tie  
Connected  
  
Connected inside  
Connected  
Connected inside

[Verse 1]  
When I was young  
I played for fun  
Made up the words  
Nobody heard  
  
But now I see  
All eyes on me  
And suddenly  
I'm in a dream  
I got a feeling now  
Everything's right somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am  
Being who I want  
Giving what I got  
Never a doubt now  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm stepping up  
Right to the top  
That's how I'm wired  
I take it higher  
  
I'm in control  
I broke the mould  
The girl you see  
Is up to me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]:  
I'm lifting off the ground  
Finding the perfect sound  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am  
Being who I want  
Giving what I got  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
Again, again and again and again  
  
Bridge:  
There's a star that's right inside you  
So come on and let it out  
  
Find out what you're about and just shout  
"Here I Am"  
Being who I want  
Giving what I got never a doubt now  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am being who I want  
Giving what I got  
Never a doubt now  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
  
Here I am being who I want  
Giving what I got  
Never a doubt now  
  
Here I go  
Burning like a spark  
Light up the dark again  
Again, again  
Again and again and again  
Again and again and again  
Here we go


One, two, three go  
My baby, don't mess around because she loves me so  
And this I know for sure  
But does she really want to but can't stand to see me  
Walk out the door  
Don't try to fight the feelin' 'cause the thought alone  
Is killin' me right now  
Thank God for mom and dad for stickin' through together  
'Cause we don't know how  
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya  
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya  
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it  
But got it just don't get it 'til' there's nothin' at all  
We get together, oh, we get together  
But separates always better when there's feelin's involved  
If what they say is, nothin' is forever  
Then what makes it, then what makes it, then what makes it  
Then what makes it, then what makes it love the exception  
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh are we so in denial?  
When you know we're not happy here  
Y'all don't want me here you just wanna dance  
(Hey ya, hey ya)  
Don't want to meet your daddy  
(Hey ya)  
Just want you in my caddy  
(Hey ya)  
Don't want to meet your momma  
(Hey ya)  
Don't want to meet your momma  
(Hey ya)  
I'm, I'm, I'm just bein' honest  
(Hey ya)  
I'm just being honest  
(Hey ya)  
Hey, common now, alright now, fellows, yeah  
Now what's cooler than bein' cool? Ice cold  
I can't hear ya, I say, what's, what's cooler than bein' cool? Ice cold  
Alright, alright, alright, alright  
Alright, alright, alright, alright  
Alright, alright, alright, alright  
Alright, alright, alright  
Okay now ladies, yeah  
We gonna break this thang down in just a few seconds  
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothin'  
Now, I wanna see y'all on y'all baddest behavior  
Gimme some sugar, I am your neighbor  
Here we go  
Shake it, shake it, shake it

Anneliese (speaking)-  
I'm savoring my first and last  
Taste of freedom before getting  
Married next week.  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
At least, you're not an  
Indentured servant.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Indentured servant?  
  
Erika-  
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot  
Madame Carp will make me pay,  
And I have to fetch the eggs myself  
And the barn's a mile away.  
It's cold and wet  
But still I get an omelette on my plate,  
But in my head I'm back in bed  
Snuggled up and sleeping late.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Really?  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Really. But it's all right.  
I mean, I'm used to it.  
And you?  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Well...  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Well?  
Anneliese-  
If I want some eggs I ring the bell  
And the maid comes running in,  
And she serves them on a silver tray  
And she brings a cookie tin.  
And while I eat, she rubs my feet  
And strolling minstrels play,  
But I'd rather be in my library  
Reading science books all day.  
  
Erika-  
I'm just like you  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
(you are?)  
Erika-  
You're just like me  
There's somewhere else we'd rather be  
Somewhere that's ours  
Somewhere that dreams come true  
Yes I am a girl like you.  
You'd never think that it was so  
But now I've met you and I know,  
It's plain as day  
Sure as the sky is blue  
I am a girl like you.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
So, you're a singer?  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
No, I work at Madame Carp's penitentiary.  
Uh, I mean, Dress Emporium.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
I love Madame Carp's dresses!  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
I made the one you're wearing.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
You made this? The design looks so complicated!  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Oh, it isn't really.  
(sings)  
First I choose a fabric from the rack  
And I pin the pattern down,  
And I stitch it in the front and back  
And it turns into a gown!  
Anneliese-  
I wear my gown  
Without my crown  
And dance around my room  
Both-  
And imagine life without the strife  
Of an unfamiliar groom.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
But I'd never let my mother know.  
I wouldn't want to disappoint her.  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
I completely understand.  
  
Anneliese-  
I'm just like you  
Erika-  
(I think that's true)  
Anneliese-  
You're just like me  
Erika-  
(Yes I can see)  
Both-  
We take responsibility  
Anneliese-  
We carry through  
Erika-  
(We carry through)  
Both-  
Do what we need to go.  
Yes I am a girl like you.  
Anneliese-  
I'm just like you  
Erika-  
(I'm just like you)  
Anneliese-  
You're just like me  
Erika-  
(You're just like me)  
Both-  
It's something anyone can see  
Anneliese-  
A heart that beats  
Erika-  
(a heart that beats)  
Both-  
A voice that speaks the truth  
Yes I am a girl like you.


Well I've been waiting all year  
Just for this day to get here,  
And I've been learning nothing goes  
Exactly like you plan.  
  
Yeah, I've been flying solo,  
Wishing I was in Soho.  
I thought I'd be a no-go for this show,  
But here I am.  
  
You might have seen me checking out  
What's underneath that tree,  
But I have realized that there is  
Just one gift for me.  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you!  
  
Wooh!  
  
The ornaments are rocking,  
Somebody stole my stocking.  
I think I threw out all my gift cards  
With the recycling.  
  
The Christmas lights are tangled,  
The mistletoe got mangled,  
And even though my nerves are jangled,  
I'm good with everything!  
  
'Cause now I know the reason  
It's the season of good cheer.  
I'd even eat the fruit cake,  
It's the same one as last year!  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you!  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Put your hands up in the air!  
Ho! Ho! Ho!  
Santa, can you feel it?  
Here we go!  
Spread the magic everywhere.  
Hey! Ho! Everybody shout out loud!  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you! (Hey! Hey! Hey!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Ho! Ho! Ho!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Here we go!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Ho! Ho! Ho!)  
'Cause I'm with you.


I don't have a balance  
Think I'm gonna Fall  
Wish I have a talent  
I don't belong here at all  
  
Drowning in the Pressure  
In above my head  
Why did I think I could do this  
I should have walk away instead  
  
(Refrain)  
This is my chance to break free  
Everythings depending on me  
And if I keep trying I'll be  
  
(Chorus)  
On Top Of The World  
Where I can see everything before me  
Reaching up to touch the sky  
On Top Of The World  
Where all of my dreams are rushed into me  
Stretching on my wings to fly  
On Top Of The World...  
  
On Top Of The World  
  
(Repeat refrain)  
  
(Chorus)  
On Top Of The World  
Where I can see everything before me  
Reaching up to touch the sky  
On Top Of The World  
Where all of my dreams are rushed into me  
Stretching on my wings to fly  
On Top Of The World


Big pink dress  
Spins and twirls  
Bffs in princess curls  
Tell the story in your tiara pearls  
Let the magic flow tonight  
Dolphin rise  
For mermaid tails  
Ocean breeze  
And glitter sails  
Sometimes dreams can be for real  
Let your fairy wings take flight  
  
Once upon a time  
Can you imagine?  
Sparkle and you shine  
You're so in fashion!  
Live by your design  
Barbie it's your turn now  
  
Once upon a time!  
  
Once upon a time  
Barbie it's magic!  
Fairy tales unwind  
We're new but classic  
Adventures in your mind  
We'll have the best time now  
Once upon a time!


What's Wrong Wofie, are ya sick  
Something in your Throat?  
Wait A Minute are you trying to meow?  
Ah Fella  
I can see it when you're feeling low  
You can't hide that from me  
You're no status quo calico  
So why keep trying to be?  
'Cause you're more than that  
You're my doggish cat  
I wish you could see the you I see  
I say  
If you bark  
Celebrate it  
Make your mark  
Serenade it  
Noah's ark  
Shoulda had a cat like you  
And if  
What you are  
Is a strange you  
Doesn't mean  
You should change you  
Only means  
You should change your point of view  
  
Hey, feline  
You fetch just fine  
To thine ownself be true  
Your bow wow's  
The cat's meow  
It's how I know you're you  
  
You don't need the bows  
Or tiara  
Bid your woes  
Sayonara  
Trust your nose  
'Cause it knows the way to go  
When you  
Chase your tail  
You're enchanting  
Spirits sail  
When you're panting  
When you wail  
You're a rover, Romeo  
  
There is not  
One hair of you  
That I would rearrange  
I love you the way you are  
And that will never change  
That will never change


It's so rare to find a friend like you  
Somehow when you're around the sky is always blue  
The way we talk  
The things you say  
The way you make it all ok  
And how you know  
All of my jokes  
But you laugh anyway  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along  
Together we dream the same dream  
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
  
Now every day is something new  
And any path we take I'm looking forward to  
The way we try and never quit  
The way that all the pieces fit  
The way we know the parts by heart  
And sing out loud  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along  
Together we dream the same dream  
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
  
And anywhere you are you know I'll be around  
And when you call my name I'll listen for the sound  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along  
Together we dream the same dream  
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me  
Oh ooh oh two voices one song  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
With you by my side I can go on  
Now I have all that I need  
And the sweetest sound will always be  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song


You're the kind of friend who always bends when I'm broken  
Like remember when  
You took my heart and put it back together again  
I've been wasting time with clueless guys  
But now it's over  
Let me tell you why, I'm through  
I've meet someone new  
Who's just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
'Cause I've been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate, you  
You're the kind of guy who's hands and mind  
Send shivers up and down my spine  
You took my heart and put it back together again  
You're the kind of guy that blows my mind  
But now it's my turn  
You've been right in front of me  
Everything I need  
Why didn't I see  
You're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
'Cause I've been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate, you  
You're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
You're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
'Cause I've been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate, you  
You're it  
You're the ultimate, you  


I was living in a fantasy,  
Waiting for somebody to rescue me,  
But I've found a way to light the dark.  
It was always here inside my heart.  
No more fairy tale pretending  
I'll make my own happy ending.  
  
If I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
I wouldn't reach up to the sky,  
Every night, in my dreams.  
There's a voice inside of me  
Saying I can do anything,  
'Cause if I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
  
There's a star that's shining down on me.  
Reflecting everything that I can be.  
Every journey starts inside the heart,  
And there's no mountain that's too far.  
If I set my mind to it,  
Whatever it is, I can do it.  
  
If I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
I wouldn't reach up to the sky,  
Every night, in my dreams.  
There's a voice inside of me  
Saying I can do anything,  
'Cause if I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings...  
  
To take me farther  
Than I ever thought I'd go.  
Higher than the heavens,  
'Cause deep inside I know...  
  
If I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
I wouldn't reach up to the sky,  
Every night, in my dreams.  
There's a voice inside of me  
Saying I can do anything,  
'Cause if I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.


Like a bird that flies  
In the morning light  
Or a butterfly in the spring  
When your spirit rides  
On the winds of hope  
You'll find your wings  
  
Erika:  
And your always free to begin again  
And your always free to believe  
When you find the place that your heart belongs  
You'll never leave  
  
Anneliese:  
You and I will always be  
Celebrating life together  
  
Both:  
I know I have found a friend forever more  
  
Anneliese:  
Love is like a melody  
One that I will always treasure  
  
Both:  
Courage is the key that opens every door  
  
Though you may not know where your gifts may lead  
And it may not show at the start  
When you live your dream  
You'll find destiny  
Is written in your heart  
  
All:  
Though you may not know where your gifts may lead  
And it may not show at the start  
When you live your dream  
You'll find destiny  
Is written in your heart


A child is born  
We've suddenly stepped through  
A thousand dolls  
A child is born  
Her chin is like mine  
But her eyes are yours  
How perfectly formed are her fingers  
So far reach, so much to know  
What words will be formed by her fingers  
We'll hold her close  
Then let her go  
How sweet to find  
A part of ourselves  
We knew nothing of  
A child is born  
A child that is born of our love


All I want for Christmas is you  
Your the gift that's made my dreams all come true  
All I need for Christmas is here  
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes  
Waiting there for me underneath the tree  
We'll the spend the day exchanging kisses  
Smile and say What a Christmas this is  
Long before the snowflakes appear  
Without bells or mistletoe or the tinsel silver glow  
You just look at me and Oh!  
Christmas is here!  
  
We will smile and say What a Christmas  
This is  
Long before the snowflakes appear  
Without bells or mistletoe  
Or the tinsel silver glow  
You just have to look at me and Oh!  
Christmas is here


This is me talking to you  
Tell me what your heart can do?  
And take me by surprise  
Whatever you see, you'll never be alone with me  
  
I close or open the door  
Telling you that less is more  
You cannot disguise whatever you do  
No one is above the law  
  
In these dark and troubled times  
People just surviving, we live a double life  
  
You'd be safe and warm at home  
Something else is going on  
We don't have to kiss  
And say no more about it  
  
And if your eyes are watching me  
Baby, life could be so beautiful  
And we become invisible  
The pleasure is the punishment for the crime  
  
Break away the chains that bind  
It's not enough to be satisfied  
It's knowing how it all begins  
Or knowing where the heart belongs  
  
And we all make mistakes  
It's your heart and my heart  
And no one can take part  
And our love, love above the law  
  
So you decide we go insane  
I know what you came here for  
Whether you're mine, I'll never be sure  
We'll ever be above the law  
  
On this dark and stormy night  
Where these walls may hide us  
(The walls may hide us)  
You sigh and let me in  
  
You let me hold you in these arms of mine  
(One flame inside)  
Tomorrow is eternity  
(Temtation eyes)  
And we may get to kiss and say no more about it  
(No tears to cry)  
  
And if my eyes are watching you  
Baby, life could be so beautiful  
(So beautiful)  
And everything is possible  
(Everything is possible)  
And we become invisible  
(We become invisible)  
  
It's your heart and my heart  
And no one can take part  
I'll always be with you  
It's what I'm living for  
  
The end of my rainbow  
Is outside your window  
And our love is one love  
Love above the law  
(Love above the law)  
  
It's your heart and my heart  
And no one can take part  
I'll always be with you  
It's what I'm living for  
(It's what I'm living for)  
  
The end of my rainbow  
Is outside your window  
Love above the law


Absent minded me  
Absent minded me  
I'm losing a key  
Or missing a glove  
Just like me to lose my love  
Gotta find it, absent minded me  
Dizzy dopey me  
Mixed-up mopey me  
  
I'm way, way ahead  
Of the game then it starts  
How did i lose my king of hearts?  
Gotta find it, absent minded me  
There's my key  
Gee, i left it in the door  
There's my glove on the shelf  
Now if i don't find my love  
I'll be losing myself  
  
Gotta find him  
Gotta find him  
Absent minded me  
Absent minded me

The average unmarried female  
Basic'lly insecure  
Due to some long frustration  
May react  
With psychosomatic symptoms  
Difficult to endure  
Affecting the upper respiratory tract  
In other words,  
Just from waiting around  
For that little band of gold  
A person can develop a cold  
You can spray her wherever you figure  
The streptococci lurk  
You can give her a shot  
For whatever she's got  
But it just won't work  
If she's tired of getting the fish-eye  
From the hotel clerk  
A person  
Can develop a cold  
The female remaining single  
Just in the legal sense  
Shows a neurotic tendency  
See note:  
Note: Chronic organic syndromes  
Toxic and hypertense  
Involving the eye,  
The ear and the nose and throat  
In other words,  
Just from worrying  
Whether the wedding is on or off,  
A person  
Can develop a cough  
You can feed her all day  
With the Vitamin A  
And the Bromo Fizz  
But the medicine never  
Gets anywhere near  
Where the trouble is  
If she's getting a kind  
Of name for herself  
And the name ain't "his"  
A person  
Can develop a cough  
And further more  
Just from stalling  
And stalling and stalling  
The wedding trip  
A person  
Can develop La grippe  
When they get on a train  
For Niag'ra  
And she can hear church bells chime  
The compartment is air conditioned  
And the mood sublime  
Then they get off at Saratoga  
For the fourteenth time  
A person  
Can develop La grippe  
La grippe, La post nasal drip  
With the wheezes  
And the sneezes  
And a sinus that's really a pip!  
For a lack of community property  
And a feeling she's getting too old  
A person  
Can develop  
A bad, bad cold!


After we love, we bathe in a glow  
Remembering what happened a moment ago  
Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh  
While it's resting on pillows of sky  
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm  
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm  
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through  
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you  
  
After the rain, the birds want to fly  
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry  
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see  
Are their loving reflections of me  
After a while, you touch me and then  
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again  
  
And then lost in a kiss,  
I could stay for hours like this  
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain  
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain


What's it all about  
Alfie  
  
Is it just for the moment we live  
What's it all about  
When you sort it out  
Alfie  
  
Are we meant to take more than we give  
Or are we meant to be kind  
And if only fools are kind  
Alfie  
  
Then I guess  
It is wise to be cruel  
And if life belongs  
Only to the strong  
Alfie  
  
What will you lend on  
An old golden rule  
As sure as I believe  
There's a heaven above  
Alfie  
  
I know there's something much more  
Something even non-believers  
Can believe in  
I believe in love  
  
Alfie  
Without true love you just exist  
Alfie  
  
Until you find the love you've missed  
You're nothing  
Alfie  
  
When you walk let your heart lead the way  
And you'll find love any day  
Alfie  
Alfie

No more talk to darkness  
Forget these wide-eyed fears  
I'm here  
Nothing can harm you  
My words will warm and calm you  
Let me be your freedom  
Let daylight dry your tears  
I'm here  
With you, beside you  
To guard you and to guide you  
  
Then, say you love me every winter morning  
Turn my head with talk of summertime  
Say you need me with you now and always  
Promise me that all you say is true  
That's all I ask of you  
  
Let me be your shelter  
Let me be your light  
You're safe  
No one will find you  
Your fears are far behind you  
  
All I want is freedom  
A world with no more night  
And you  
Always beside me  
To hold me and to hide me  
Then say you'll share with me one love,  
One lifetime  
Let me lead you from your solitude  
Say you need me with you,  
Here beside you  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Christine that's all I ask of you  
  
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
Share each day with me,  
Each night, each morning  
Say you love me (You know I do)  
Love me  
That's all I ask of you  
  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Love me  
That's all I ask of you


Once I found the perfect love  
And you showed me everything there was  
to know of love  
Time will not betray the truth  
And for all the years we've shared  
I celebrate with you  
For you  
  
Un giorno t'incontrai  
And me  
Pensai, "Adesso lei"  
Will be  
D'allora insieme noi  
  
Forever  
You are all I know of love  
How could I ask for more  
You're everything I'm dreaming of  
You're all I need from love  
And every star above  
Spells out your name  
I swear I'll always feel the same  
You're all I want  
  
From love  
All I want from love  
Dimmi  
Che per l'eternita  
Like a memory  
Mi terrai ad abitare nei pensieri tuoi  
Con te  
You are my only heart  
In te  
I loved you from the start  
Noi due  
Together not apart  
  
Forever  
You are all I know of love  
How could I ask for more  
You're everything I'm dreaming of  
You're all I need from love  
And every star above  
Spells out your name  
I swear I'll always feel the same  
You're all Want  
  
From love  
  
You're all I want from love  
  
Pensami  
I think of him  
Perche'io sogno te  
You'll be with me  
Due cuori e un anima  
My love flows free through you  
E liberi  
I live my whole life  
I'll live my life  
  
To be with you  
You'll always be the one who taught me  
Everything my heart knows to be sure  
My heart knows you  
You're all I know of love  
How could I ask for more  
You're everything I'm dreaming of  
You're all I need from love  
  
And every star above  
Every star above  
  
Spells out your name  
I swear I'll always feel the same  
You're all I want  
  
From love  
You're all I want from love  
  
You're all I know of love


All is fair in love,  
Love's a crazy game  
Two people vow to stay  
In love as one they say  
But all is changed with time  
The future none can see  
The road you leave behind  
Ahead lies mystery, but all is fair in love  
I have to go away  
A writer takes his pen to write the words again  
All in love is fair...  
All of fate's a chance  
It's either good or bad  
I tossed my coin to say, to say  
In love with me you'd stay  
But all in war is so cold  
You either win or lose  
When all is put away  
The losing side I'll play...  
All is fair in love  
I could have never left your side  
A writer takes his pen to write the words again  
That all in love is fair  
A writer takes his pen to write the words again...  
That all in love is fair...


I was alone  
You were alone  
Parallel lines that touched one another  
Just feeling our way  
Lost in the dark  
Drawn to each other  
So much to say  
So much to do  
So much of you for me to discover  
Like what makes you laugh  
What makes you cry  
How does a friend become a lover, too?  
I've waited all of my life to find  
Someone who'd need my heart  
And read my mind  
To light my days and warm my nights  
Someone I know I could call  
My someone for all my life  
Looking at you  
Looking at me  
Loving the look of love that I see there  
I find when I look deep in your eyes  
Reflections of me there  
I've waited all of my life to find  
Someone who'd need my heart and read my mind  
To light my days and warm my nights  
Now all at once in your arms  
Everything's new  
All that I feel tells me it's true  
All that I ask is all of my life with you  


I want a gown of diamonds  
Long gloves and sweet perfumes  
Hats made of silks and satins  
Seaqueens and ostrich plums  
I want to wear mascara  
Polish my nails real bright  
I want to be an actress  
Actresses play all night  
If I should sneeze it's a sign  
All that I want to will be mine  
Oh please, pretty, please  
Dear nose make me sneeze  
I want to find my true love  
Like all the love songs say  
I want to do what I want  
I want to get my way  
Wild dreams grow wise  
When sweet childhood flies  
Time waved a hand  
And the breeze blue the sand from my eyes  
I want a gown of kingdom  
Diamonds would weigh me down  
Pompoms and plums are pretty  
If you're a circus clown  
Funny how black mascara  
Streaks when the tears begin  
Nail polish, rouge and powder  
Can't paint the sparkle in  
Once I was slaved to a sneeze  
Now sneezing is just a disease  
A rose is a rose  
And a nose just a nose  
True love's a phrase for love songs  
Real love's a leaving thing  
I want the love worth living  
I want the things I sing  
I want the love worth living  
I want the things I sing  


Time and again I've longed for adventure  
Something tn make my heart beat the faster  
What did I long for I never really knew  
Finding your love I found my adventure  
Touching your hand my heart beats the faster  
All that I want in all of this world is...  
  
... You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink  
Of a lovely song  
  
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I've known are what you are  
Someday my happy arms will hold  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine  
  
Dah-dah-dah  
  
Someday my happy arms will hold  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine  
Too-too-mm-dah-dah-dah


O beautiful for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain!  
America! America!  
God shed his grace on thee,  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!  
O beautiful for heroes proved,  
In liberating strife,  
Who more than self, their country loved  
And more than life  
America! America!  
God mend thine every flaw,  
Confirm thy soul in self-control,  
Thy liberty in law!  
If you'd like to join me, please do!  
O beautiful for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain!  
America! America!  
God shed his grace on thee,  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!  
To shining sea!


Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
And auld lang syne  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear  
For auld lang syne  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne

And surely I'll be mine  
And we'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne

An pou'd the gowans fine  
But we've wander'd mony a weary fitt  
Sin' auld lang syne  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear  
For auld lang syne  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne  
  
We twa hae paidl'd in the burn  
Frae morning sun till dine


Chorus:  
Hey here comes Joe now running down the street, hey Joe!  
He must have news the way he moves his feet, hey Joe!  
He's coming from the meeting with the boss, hey Joe!  
I hope they didn't throw him for a loss, hey Joe!  
He must have news about the strike, I wonder what it's like.  
Hey Joe! Hey Joe! Hey Joe, don't be so slow!  
Tell us, Joe! Spill it, Joe! Joe, what do you know?  
  
Joe:  
What do I know?  
I ain't heard as good news since Lord knows when,  
For the strike is over, boys,  
Back to work again!  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah!  
  
Joe:  
The fighting's through now,  
There's no more fuss  
For the strike is over, boys,  
Back to work for us!  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah!  
  
Joe:  
We gave a little, and we took a little.  
It was quite a fight but things came out all right!  
Shout to the rafters, let yourselves go.  
For the striking all is done, let's have fun,  
The day is won, back to work we go!  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah!  
Back to work again!  
Back to work for us! Joe:  
We gave a little, and we took a little. We gave and we took--  
It was quite a fight It was quite a fight  
  
Joe:  
But things came out all right!  
Shout to the rafters, let yourselves go.  
For the striking all is done,  
  
Joe and chorus:  
Let's have fun,  
The day is won, back to work we go!  
Back to work, Joe!  
Back to work, Joe!  
Back to work we go!


Someone to hold you too close  
Someone to hurt you too deep  
Someone to sit in your chair  
And ruin your sleep  
And make you aware of being alive  
  
Someone to need you too much  
Someone to know you too well  
Someone to pull you up short  
And put you through hell  
And give you support for being alive-being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody hold me too close  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you of being alive,  
Being alive, being alive!  
  
Someone you have to let in  
Someone whose feelings you spare  
Someone who, like it or not  
Will want you to share a little, a lot of being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody crowd me with love  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you to help us survive,  
Being alive, being alive, being alive, being alive


How do you say to your child in the night  
Nothing is all black but then nothing is all white?  
How do you say it will all be alright  
When you know that it mightn't be true?  
What do you do?  
  
Careful the things you say,  
Children will listen.  
Careful the things you do,  
Children will see.  
And learn.  
Children may not obey,  
But children will listen.  
Children will look to you  
For which way to turn,  
To learn what to be.  
Careful before you say,  
"listen to me."  
Children will listen.  
  
Careful the wish you make,  
Wishes are children.  
Careful the path they take,  
Wishes come true,  
Not free.  
Careful the spell you cast,  
Not just on children.  
Sometimes the spell may last  
Past what you can see  
And turn against you...  
  
Careful the tale you tell.  
That is the spell.  
Children will listen...  
  
How can you say to a child who's in flight,  
Don't slip away and i won't hold so tight?  
What can you say that no matter how slight won't be misunderstood?  
What do you leave to your child when you're dead  
Only what ever you put in its head  
Things that your mother and father had said  
Which were left to them too.  
Careful what you say, children will listen  
Careful you do it too, children will see and learn.  
Oh!  
  
Guide them but step away,  
Children will glisten.  
Temper with what is true  
And children will turn,  
If just to be free.  
Careful before you say,  
"listen to me."  
Children will listen...  
Children will listen!  
Children, children will listen


This is a Christmas Lullaby  
To steal softly into dreaming  
A simple Christmas lullaby  
I sing to you each passing year  
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder in silent mystery  
And in this spell that we are under  
Blessing surround our hearts completely  
This is a Christmas Lullaby  
For someone lovely as snow falling  
I sing your Christmas Lullaby  
To cradle you with all our love  
Let peace on earth be yours tonight  
Under the star that shines so bright  
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder  
In Silent mystery  
And in this spell that we are under  
Blessing surround our hearts completely  
Now close your eyes and as you sigh  
Make up a Christmas wish to dream on  
And like the moon that shines on high  
Send out your wish to that star in the sky  
Blessed by this Christmas lullaby.........!


Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Making footprint in the snow  
Mem'ries  
  
Christmas Mem'ries  
They're the sweetest ones I know  
Cookies baking  
In the kitchen  
  
Cards and ribbons  
Everywhere  
Frosty Christmas Mem'ries  
Float like snowflakes in the air  
  
And oh the joy of waking X-mas morning  
The fam'ly round the tree  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
As merry as can be  
  
I close my eyes and see  
Shiny faces  
Of all the children  
Who now have children of their own  
  
Funny  
But come December'  
I remember every X-mas I've known  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
  
As merry as can be  
I close my eyes and see  
Those shiny faces  
Of all the children who now have children  
  
Of their own  
It's funny  
But come December  
When I remember  
  
Every X-mas I've ever known  
Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Shiny faces of all the children  
  
Precious mem'ries  
Of every Christmas  
I've known...


  
  
  
  
Some say  
  
the walls betweeen us stand so tall  
  
they don't see there's just one sun  
  
shining on us all  
  
I say  
  
we each choose roads to call our own  
  
but none of us is travelling through  
  
this universe alone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we've gone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
connecting our humanity  
  
joining me to you and you to me  
  
seasons  
  
keep spinning on the wheel of time  
  
we stand we fall  
  
we struggle up  
  
the mountains we must climb  
  
different dreams  
  
may colour what we see ahead  
  
but our lives are strong together  
  
on a common thread  
  
and this circle (circle)  
  
just goes on and on (on and on)  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we've gone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
connecting our humanity  
  
joining me to you and you to me  
  
around and round and round and round we go  
  
around and round and round we go  
  
love and learn and change and grow  
  
round and round and round we go  
  
and this circle  
  
touches everyone  
  
as it crosses every boundary  
  
underneath the sun  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we're gone  
  
yes this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
someday we will come to see  
  
I'm joined to you and you to me  
  


Goodbye, no use leading with our chins  
This is where our story ends  
Never lovers, ever friends  
  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day  
But before you walk away  
I sincerely want to say  
  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
And then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love!  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love!  
  
My breaking heart and i agree  
That you and i could never ever be  
So with my best, my very best, i set you free!  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
A cozy fire to keep you warm  
But most of all, but most of all  
  
When snowflakes fall, i wish you wealth  
I wish you health, i wish you love!


As close as the sea is to the seashore  
Tide still rises twice a day  
That's just the ocean's way of getting  
Closer, closer.  
  
As close as today is to tomorrow  
At midnight they can finally touch  
'Cause every minute brings them that much closer  
Closer  
  
So on this silent night  
I call your name  
And suddenly all time and space disappears  
I see your face in firelight  
  
I hold you close in memory  
And even though you're gone  
I know you're here  
As close as the glow is to the ember  
  
You've always been a part of me  
Now living in my heart you're even closer  
Closer.  
I see your face in firelight  
  
I hold you close in memory  
And even though I know you're gone  
I know you're here....  
As sure as there's snowfall in December  
  
Your love lives in everything  
Summer Winter Fall or Spring  
Every thought of you will bring us closer  
The distance may be large or small  
  
Someday I pray that we may all be  
Closer...  
Closer.


Hear my voice where you are  
Take a train, steal a car  
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me  
Catch a plane, catch a breeze  
On your hands, on your knees  
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me  
On a mule, in a jet  
With your hair in a net  
In a towel when you're wet  
I don't care, this is where you should be  
  
From the hills, from the shore  
Ride the wind to my door  
Turn the high with the dust  
Break the law if you must  
Move the world, only just come back to me  
  
Blast you high, hear me call  
Must i fight city hall  
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me  
What on earth must i do  
Scream and yell till i'm blue  
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?  
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon  
At your rack, at your room  
Mademoiselle, where in hell can you be?  
  
Leave a sign on your door  
Out to lunch ever more  
In a royce or a van, wrapped in mink coats or rain  
Anyway that you can, come back to me  
Hear my voice through the dim  
Feel the waves on your skin  
Like a call from within, come back to me  
Leave behind all your own  
Tell your flowers you will phone  
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me  
  
Let your tub overflow  
If a date waits below  
Let him wait for godot  
By the rail,  
Come by mail, cod  
Par avion, par bateau  
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux  
  
Come by steam, come by gas  
Call for free on a pass  
On the drags and the glass, come back to me  
Leave your bills all unpaid  
Let your bed go unmade  
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me  
Come by sail, come by freight  
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate  
I don't care this is where you should be  
  
Come in pain or in joy  
As a girl, as a boy  
In a bag or a trunk (shut up!)  
On a horse or a drunk  
In the flora or faun, come back to me  
Come back to me, come back...  
  
"daisy"  
"will you stop bothering me?"  
"why, daisy, you're a bloody miracle!"


I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain and deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me  
Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Rain or shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
And won't it be fine  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
And won't it be fine  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you, I'm with you rain or shine  
I'm with you, I'm with you rain or shine


If you want a fancy fan  
Or a turkey born in turkey-stan  
Or a slave that's awf'lly african  
Or a teapot early ming,  
Come to the supermarket in old peking.  
  
If you want to buy a kite  
Or a pup to keep you up at night  
Or a dwarf who used to know snow white  
Or a frog who loves to sing,  
Come to the supermarket in old peking.  
  
They have: sunflow'are cakes, moonbeam cakes,  
Gizzard cakes, lizard cakes,  
Pickled eels, pickle snakes,  
Fit for any king,  
  
If you want a bust of jade  
Or an egg that's more or less decayed  
Or in case you care to meet a maid  
For a nice but naughty fling,  
  
Come to the supermarket,  
If you come on an ostrich, you can park it,  
So come to the supermarket  
And see pe-  
King.  
  
If you want a gong to beat  
Or a rickshaw with a sassy seat  
Or a painting slightly indiscreet  
That is simply riveting,  
Come to the supermarket and see peking.  
  
Well, if you want some calico  
Or a gentle water buffalo  
Glow worm guaranteed to glow  
Or a cloak inclined to cling,  
Come to the supermarket in old peking.  
  
They have bird's-nest soup, seaweed soup,  
Noodle soup, poodle soup,  
Talking crows with the croup,  
Almost anything.  
  
If you want to buy a saw  
Or a fish delicious when it's raw  
Or a pill to kill your moth'are-in-law  
Or a bee without a sting,  
  
Come to the supermarket,  
If you come on a turtle, you can park it,  
So come to the supermarket  
If you come on a goose, you can park it,  
So come to the supermarket  
And see  
Pe-  
King!


Are you ready for the day that we pray for  
Already holding what is real?  
You know the soul finds its own evolution  
And this is the only love I feel  
  
And I tell you, I'm keeping up the strength  
I gotta try 'cause you ain't getting past this heart of mine  
I'm out here waiting for you with all I've got to give  
And I accept this life we live  
  
I'll be your lover and I'll be your friend  
I'm gonna follow you right to the end  
I wasn't made to tell you lies  
I only came to make you realize  
  
I'll be your hero and I'll be your clown  
You pick me up, you let me down  
Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait  
'Cause come tomorrow, will be too late  
  
Come tomorrow, oh, come tomorrow  
  
I got to turn away my face  
'Cause you blind me with your light  
Can you catch up to me?  
You know I love you in the black of night  
This sacred ritual, this journey has begun  
And we try, we try to carry on  
  
And you innocents, you get to find the things in life  
That get you through  
(One more dance)  
And deep inside, the things you were  
No one ever knew  
  
(One last chance)  
Let me make it happen  
This world we have foreseen  
(Ooh)  
And I will tell you how I feel  
  
Love will be better for wearing your ring  
I'm gonna give you everything  
I wasn't made to tell you lies  
I only came to make you realize  
  
I'll be your hero and I'll be your clown  
You pick me up, you let me down  
Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait  
'Cause come tomorrow, will be too late  
  
Come tomorrow, come tomorrow  
Come tomorrow, come back tomorrow  
Come tomorrow, come tomorrow  
Come tomorrow, ah, come tomorrow


I still can remember  
The last time I cried  
I was holding you and loving you  
Knowing it would end  
  
I never felt so good  
Yet felt so bad  
You're the one I love  
And what makes it sad  
Is you don't belong to me  
  
And I can remember  
The last time I lied  
I was holding you and telling you  
We could still be friends  
  
Tried to let you go  
But I can't, you know  
And even though I'm not with you  
I need you so  
But you don't belong to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Comin' in and out of your life  
Isn't easy,  
When there are so many nights  
I can't hold you and I've told you  
These feelings are so hard to find  
Comin' in and out of your life  
Will never free me  
'cause I don't need to touch you  
To feel you, it's so real with you  
  
I just can't get you out of my mind  
But I can remember the last time we tried  
Each needing more than we could give  
And knowing all the time  
A stronger love  
Just can't be found  
Even though at times this crazy world  
Is turning up-side-down  
You'll always belong to me  
  
[Chorus]


[Dolly speaking]:  
Put your hand on her waist and stand  
With her right in your left hand  
And one and one two three, ah! One two three,  
Oh, no, this one... And one two three  
One two three  
  
[Cornelius speaking]:  
Look I'm dancing!  
Well, I was.  
  
[Dolly speaking]:  
Of course you were, Mr. Hackl!  
[singing]  
Take the someone whose arms you're in  
Hold onto her tight and spin  
And one two three, one two three, one two three  
  
[Cornelius:]  
Look, I'm dancing!  
  
[Dolly:]  
Come here.  
Turn around and turn around, try floating through the air  
Can't you be a little more aesthetic?  
  
[Cornelius:]  
Don't you think my dancing has a polish and a flair?  
  
[Dolly:]  
The word I think I'd use is athletic!  
  
[Cornelius:]  
Well my heart is about to burst  
My head is about to pop  
And now that I'm dancing who cares if I ever stop!  
  
[Dolly:]  
That's wonderful, Mr. Hackl!  
  
[Cornelius:]  
... Look, everybody! I, Cornelius Hackl... Sport  
... I'm dancing!  
  
[Dolly:]  
You're next, Mr. Tucker!  
Glide and step and then step and glide  
  
[Barnaby:]  
And everyone stand aside!  
  
[Dolly:]  
Oh, not yet Mr. Tucker! One, two, three...  
One, two, three, ah!  
  
Cornelius  
Look, he's dancing!  
Dolly  
I think he's phenomenal!  
You could learn to polka if you worked a week or so  
Or the tango filled with passion seething  
  
[Barnaby:]  
I might join the chorus of the castle garden show  
  
[Dolly:]  
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker, kee-keep breathing  
  
[All three:]  
For my heart is about to burst  
My head is about to pop  
And now that we're dancing who cares if we ever stop!  
  
[All:]  
Make the music weave a spell  
Whirl away your worry  
Things look almost twice as well  
When you're slightly blurry  
As around and around you go  
Your spirits will hit the top  
And now that we're dancing  
Who cares if we ever stop  
One-two-three  
One-two-three  
One-two  
And now that we're dancing  
Who cares if we ever stop!


Deep in the night, I remember  
There I am reaching for you  
Longing to turn to you  
That's all I want oh so much  
Deep in the night I need you  
To touch me  
Deep in the night, I wait for daylight  
Daytimes I always get through  
But when the sun goes down  
That's when I feel  
I feel oh so alone  
Deep in the night I need you  
To hold me  
Read a book and I think about you  
Put it down and I think about you  
I make some coffee and I think about you  
Wash up the cup and I think about you  
Wind the clock and I think about you  
Turn on the light and I think about you  
When I punch the pillow and I think about you  
Deep in the night I feel lonely  
Why didn't I try someone new?  
It didn't work out I know  
But I know but I know  
Because I try I try  
Deep in the night  
I need you beside me  
Deep deep in the night  


This time we almost  
Made the pieces fit  
Didn't we, love?  
This time we almost  
Made some sense of it  
Didn't we, love?  
  
This time I had the answer  
Right here in my hand  
Then I touched it  
And it had turned to sand  
  
This time we almost  
Sang our song in tune  
Didn't we, love?  
This time we almost  
Made it, made it to the moon  
Oh, didn't we, love?  
  
This time we almost  
Made our poem rhyme  
This time we almost  
Made that long hard climb  
  
Didn't we almost make it?  
Didn't we almost make it?  
Didn't we almost make it  
This time?


[Barbra:]  
Once there was a wicked witch  
In the lovely land of oz  
And a wickeder, wickeder,  
Wickeder witch that never, ever was  
She filled the folks in Munchkin Land  
With terror and with dread  
Till one fine day from Kansas  
A house fell on her head  
And the coroner pronounced her: dead  
And through the town the joyous news went running  
The joyous news that the wicked old witch  
Was finally done in  
Ding-Dong! The witch is dead!  
  
[Harold:]  
Which old witch?  
[Barbra:]  
The wicked witch  
Ding-Dong! The wicked witch is dead!  
Wake up you sleepy head  
  
[Harold:]  
Rub your eyes  
  
[Barbra:]  
Get out of that bed  
Wake up! The wicked old witch is dead!  
  
[Both:]  
She's gone where the goblins go  
Below, below, below - yo-ho!  
Let's open up and sing  
  
[Barbra:]  
And ring those bells out...  
  
[Harold:]  
Sing the news out!  
  
[Barbra:]  
Ding-Dong! The merry-o  
Sing it high and sing it low  
Let them know the wicked old witch is dead  
  
[Harold:]  
Why everyone's glad  
She took such a crownin'  
  
[Barbra:]  
Bein' hit by a house  
Is even worse than drownin'  
  
[Both:]  
Let 'em know the wicked old witch is dead!!!


It's darker than the dark bottom  
Rumbles more than the Rumba  
If you think that the two steps got 'em  
  
Just take a look at this number  
It's got that certain swing  
That makes you wanna sing  
  
Don't go left, but be polite  
Move to the right  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Close your eyes, to where you're bound  
And you'll be found  
Doing the reactionary  
  
All the best dictators do it  
Millionaires keep steppin' to it  
The four hundred love to sing it  
Ford and Morgan swing it  
  
Hand up high and shake your head  
You'll soon see red  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Don't go left, but be polite  
Move to the right  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Close your eyes, to where you're bound  
And you'll be found  
Doing the reactionary  
  
All the best dictators do it  
Millionaires keep steppin' to it  
The four hundred love to sing it  
Ford and Morgan swing it  
  
Hand up high and shake your head  
You'll soon see red  
Doing the reac'  
Doing the reactionary  
  
So get in it, begin it  
It's smart, oh, so very  
To do the reactionary


It's not easy it's never been easy  
To let anyone see the sentimental side of me  
Hard as I try, I can't help but show  
It's my heart you're takin' as you go  
Don't like goodbyes, tears or sighs  
I'm not too good at leavin' time  
I got no taste for grievin' time  
No, no, no, not me  
You've been my near one ever my dear one  
I never thought that you would find another love  
A different kind but it came to be  
Now that your future is looking up  
Forget the past and go fill your loving cup  
But remember, remember leavin' is fine  
And the world overhead has a clear new shine  
I won't be grievin' now that you're leavin'  
It's travelin' time and you must move on  
Found someone that you can lean upon  
And if I could arrange it oh, would I care to change it  
Not me, not me  


Don't tell me not to live,  
Just sit and putter,  
Life's candy and the sun's  
A ball of butter.  
Don't bring around a cloud  
To rain on my parade.  
Don't tell me not to fly,  
I've simply got to.  
  
If someone takes a spill,  
It's me and not you.  
Who told you you're allowed  
To rain on my parade!  
I'll march my band out,  
I'll beat my drum,  
And if I'm fanned out,  
Your turn at bat, sir.  
At least I didn't fake it.  
  
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it!  
But whether I'm the rose  
Of sheer perfection,  
Or freckle on the nose  
Of life's complexion,  
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye,  
I gotta fly once,  
I gotta try once,  
Only can die once, right, sir?  
  
Ooh, life is juicy,  
Juicy, and you see  
I gotta have my bite, sir!  
Get ready for me, love,  
Cause I'm a "comer,"  
I simply gotta march,  
My heart's a drummer.  
Don't bring around a cloud  
To rain on my parade!  
  
I'm gonna live and live now,  
Get what I want, I know how,  
One roll for the whole shebang,  
One throw, that bell will go clang,  
Eye on the target, and wham,  
One shot, one gun shot, and bam,  
Hey, Mister Arnstein, here I am!  
  
I'll march my band out,  
I'm beating my drum,  
And if I'm fanned out,  
Your turn at bat, sir,  
At least I didn't fake it.  
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it.  
  
Get ready for me, love,  
Cause I'm a "comer,"  
I simply gotta march,  
My heart's a drummer.  
Nobody, no, nobody  
Is gonna rain on my parade!


Down with love  
With flowers and rice and shoes  
Down with love  
The root of all midnight blues  
Down with things  
That give you that well-known pain  
Take that moon  
Wrap it in cellophane  
  
Down with love let's liquidate  
All it's friends  
Like moon, June, roses  
And rainbow's ends  
Down with songs  
That mourn about night and day  
Down with love  
Take it away, away  
  
Take it away, take it away  
Give it back to the birds  
To bees and the Viennese  
  
Down with eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with sighs, down with cupid  
Brother let's stuff that dove  
Down with love  
  
Down with love  
Liquidate all it's friends  
Like moon, June, roses  
And rainbow's ends  
Down with song  
That mourns about night and day  
You are the one,  
And i don't stand a chance with a ghost like you  
Ah, the promised kiss of spring is here,  
What does my heart go dancin' overhead,  
On the ceiling near my bed,  
We go now,  
Because i talk to the trees, but they don't listen to me  
I tell them: you say either, i say i-ther  
You say neither, i say neither, i say ni-ther  
Either, i-ther  
Neither, ni-ther  
Let's call the whole thing off!  
  
Take it away, take it away  
Give it back to the birds  
And the bees and the Viennese  
  
Down with eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with sighs, down with cupid  
Brother let's stuff that dove  
  
Down, down, down  
I go on round and round  
I go in a spin  
Hey, in the spin, I'm in!  
What is this thing  
What is this thing called love?


Draw me a circle that's perfectly round  
One curving line, simple and fine  
Now add two ears, and a lopsided nose,  
And if you care, add some hair  
Now draw two eyes and make them bright  
Because they've just seen a beautiful sight  
Sketch in a mouth with a radiant grin  
One coming deep from within  
You've drawn me a circle and now that you're through,  
It's a picture of me after being with you...  


Face in the mirror looks the same every morning  
I keep looking for a change  
Sometimes I wonder am I standing still in time  
Tired of doing everything the same old way  
Tired of playing all the games that people play  
This running round in circles gives me no peace of mind I need to find  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to laugh  
Sometimes I need to cry  
I need the emotion  
I need to love so hard  
I don't know what to do  
And baby, I need you  
Oh  
  
Sometimes I need a good old fashioned fight  
It doesn't matter If I'm wrong or right  
Please don't worry about it  
You know how much I care  
Sometimes I need to make love all day long  
Sometimes I need to hold you in my arms  
Let's drift away together  
It doesn't matter where  
As long as you're there cause I need  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to laugh  
Sometimes I need to cry  
I need the emotion  
I need to love so hard  
I don't know what to do  
And baby , I need you  
Oh  
  
Sometimes I need to tear the whole thing down  
Sometimes I need to turn it all around  
When I put it back together I'll be calling out to you  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to laugh sometimes I need to cry  
Cry  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to feel each passing day go by  
By  
I need the emotion  
I need to love so hard I don't know what to do  
And baby I need you  
I need the emotion  
I need the emotion  
  
Yes I do  
I need the emotion  
I need ya baby  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Oh won't ya baby?  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Feels so good  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Yes I do baby  
Oh  
  
I need the emotion  
I said emotion  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Every day  
I need the emotion  
Emotion  
Every hour  
I need emotion baby


Love soft as an easy chair  
Love fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
  
You and I will make each night a first  
Every day a beginning  
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed  
They warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love  
  
Two lives that shine as one  
Morning glory and midnight sun  
Time we've learned to sail above  
Time won't change the meaning of one love  
Ageless and ever evergreen


I want to learn what life is for  
I don't want much, I just want more  
Ask what I want and I will sing  
I want everything (everything)  
  
I'd cure the cold and the traffic jam  
If there were floods, I'd give a dam  
I'd never sleep, I'd only sing  
Let me do everything (everything)  
  
I'd like to plan a city, play the cello  
Play at Monte Carlo, play Othello  
Move into the white house, paint it yellow  
Speak Portuguese and dutch  
  
And if it's not too much  
I'd like to have the perfect twin  
One who'd go out as I came in  
I've got to grab the big brass ring  
So I'll have everything (everything)  
  
I'm like a child who's set free  
At the fun fair  
Every ride invites me  
And it's unfair  
  
Saying that I only  
Get my one share  
Doesn't seem just  
I could live as I must  
  
If they'd  
Give me the time to turn a tide  
Give me the truth if once I lied  
Give me the man who's gonna bring  
  
More of everything  
Then I'll have everything  
Everything


Everything must change  
Nothing stays the same  
Everyone must change  
No one stays the same  
The young become the old  
And mysteries do unfold  
Cause that's the way of time  
Nothing and no one goes unchanged  
There are not many things in life  
You can be sure of  
Except rain comes from the clouds  
  
Sun lights up the sky  
And hummingbirds do fly  
Winter turns to spring  
A wounded heart will heal  
But never much too soon  
  
Yes  
Everything must change  
The young become the old  
And mysteries do unfold  
Cause that's the way of time  
Nothing and no one goes unchanged  
There are not many things in life  
You can be sure of  
Except rain comes from the clouds  
  
Sun lights up the sky  
And butterflies do fly  
Rain comes from the clouds  
Sun lights up the sky  
And music  
And music  
Makes me cry


Time has passed. Fanny has given birth  
To a daughter, Frances, who is now five  
Months old, and Fanny is going back into  
The new Ziegfeld show. Eddie and  
Mrs. Strakosh suggest that Fanny's  
Mother needs a new interest in life.  
  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find yourself a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
You're demented.  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find yourself a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
That's just what I need.  
[Eddie:]  
You'll see what a difference it makes ev'ry day.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Send me a letter,  
You'll write me a resume  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Just take me and Dave--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Romeo and Juliet--  
[Eddie:]  
Dave is still her slave.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Send the slave my regards!  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Open your heart and from out of the skies  
A prince on a horse will materialize.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Boy, is some lucky prince  
Gonna get a surprise!  
[All:]  
Find a man!  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find yourself a man,  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
I repeat it, Rose.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Find myself a man.  
[Eddie:]  
You're defeated, Rose.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
I'll hang a sign out,  
Big letters that high,  
Come in and sample  
You don't have to buy.  
[Eddie:]  
Hear a voice talk back.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
I hear voices now.  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Money you don't lack--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Why, you've been countin'?  
Just what I need is a middle-aged sheik  
Whose uppers and lowers  
Will click when he'll speak,  
And life is a song 'cause he'll click and I'll creak.  
[All:]  
Find a man.  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
The man that you select--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
What about him?  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Must treat you with respect.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
That's important.  
[Eddie:]  
He must understand there  
Are rules to obey,  
Not toy with your morals  
And lead you astray.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Please, darling, let the man do things his way.  
Mrs. Strakosh and [Eddie:]  
Find a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
I'm a grandmother!  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
You got somebody in mind?  
[All:]  
Find yourself  
A man.


Please forgive this platitude  
But I like your attitude  
You are just the kind I've had in mind,  
Never could find  
  
Honey, I'm so keen on you  
I could come to lean on you  
On a random bay  
Give you your way  
  
Do what you say  
Gee, it's all fine and dandy  
Sugar candy,  
When I've got you  
  
Then I only see the sunny side  
Even trouble has its funny side  
When you're gone, my sugar candy  
I get so lonesome, I get so blue  
  
But when you're handy  
It's fine and dandy  
But when you're gone  
What can I do?


People are born to love and be happy  
Living a sunshine  
And a cloudy sky can lead to a rainbow  
Lookin' at life that way  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you're lucky to find a special man  
You gotta love him all you can  
And anything he wants from you  
Should be the least that you can do  
Don't let him down  
Just give him love  
Don't let his dreams turn into dust  
He's only tryin' to build a wonderland for two  
If you're the one to share his world  
Just be the someone he can trust  
For the sake of love  
For the love of love  
For pete's sake  
Don't let him down  
Don't let him down  
  
You can live in a castle  
And dream of your diamonds  
Thinkin' you really walk tall  
But livin' and dreamin' when you're alone  
Ain't livin' or dreamin' at all  
  
(repeat chorus to fade)


I met a boy called Frank Mills,  
On September 12th right here,  
In front of Waverley, but unfortunately,  
I lost his address.  
He was last seen with his friend,  
A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles,  
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back.  
I love him but it embarrasses me,  
To walk down the street with him.  
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere,  
And wears a white crash helmet.  
He has gold chains on his leather jacket,  
And on the back are written the names,  
"Mary" and "Mom" and "Hell's Angels".  
I would gratefully appreciate it,  
If you see him, tell him,  
I'm in the park with my girlfriend.  
And please,  
Tell him Angela and I don't want the 2 dollars back,  
Just him.


You don't have to shout,  
From now on, I'm out of the kitchen.  
What's more, I can't stand your cigarette brand,  
And I'm switchen'.  
I'm unhappy with things the way that they've occured.  
It is time to face facts and not mince a word.  
Certain parties with bird-brains are getting the bird.  
Au revior, fare-thee-well and goodbye. And I'll tell you why.  
  
A funny thing happened on my way to love.  
I lost the young fella I've been dreaming of.  
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call,  
To someone who's no fun at all.  
Well, I've stopped forgetting, what else can I do?  
And much thanks for letting me practise on you.  
It's farewell my lovely, excuse, please, my dust.  
Unravel and travel I must.  
No tears, no hurt surprise,  
It's with a pleasant glow I realise.  
If I have that much love so deep, true and strong.  
All ready to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong.  
Then think of the treasures, the joy and delight,  
I'll give to my own Mr. Right.  
My own Mr. Right.  
So asta la vista, ta-ta, toodle-oo,  
The world will keep turning but not around you.  
There's someone else waiting that's more than a friend.  
Best wishes and dishes I'll send.  
And so, so-long, I'm on my way.  
Thanks for the buggy-ride and may I say -  
If I have that much love so deep true and strong.  
Already to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong.  
Then think of the treasures, the joy and delight,  
I'll give, as long as I live, at night,  
To my own Mr. Right.


One golden dawn  
One summer night  
With nothing left to say  
  
We let the dream begin  
It was carried on the wind  
And it wandered away  
  
One golden sky  
One spark of light  
Forever will remain  
  
And the song of the storm  
Brought us close, kept us warm  
All alone making love  
In the rain  
  
Gone is the world outside  
Home on the turning tide  
True love will find the sun  
And know the reason why  
  
You make me hunger for  
You whispered, "Mi amor"  
Over the ocean's roar  
And the night will become  
Our golden dawn  
  
Two hearts as one  
No tears to cry  
With you I have it all  
  
If love can never die  
I'm not afraid to fly  
But how far must I fall  
  
One silver song  
One lullaby  
For all the love we make  
  
It's the look in your eyes  
It's the moon on the rise  
It's the sound of the heart  
That you break  
  
Gone is the dark of night  
Call on the early glow  
Send down the birds of love  
That circle us below  
  
And still I will hunger for  
You whispering, "Mi amor"  
Over the ocean's roar  
And your arms reach for me  
  
And the shine on the sea  
And the night will become  
Our golden dawn


(Stephen Sondheim)  
  
Yes I know, goodbye for now,  
How long? A year, a day?  
Yes I love you, yes you're with me,  
Here now, next to me, and worlds away!  
See I free you, and I'll see you when I see you,  
Fine, ok?  
Goodbye for now, again  
Goodbye until whenever then  
We're free, that's what we said we'd be,  
At leave to come an' go, you as well as I,  
Somehow each "hello" makes it worth "goodbye"  
For now


Now it's time to say goodnight  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the sun turns out his light  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for me.  
  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the moon begins to shine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the sun turns out his light  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dream for me  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Goodnight,  
Everybody, everybody  
Everywhere,  
Goodnight,


Gotta move, gotta get out  
Gotta leave this place, gotta find some place  
Some other place, some brand new place  
Some place where each face that I see  
Won't be staring back at me  
Telling me what to be and how to be it  
Some place where I can just be me  
Gotta move, got to get out  
  
Gotta leave this town, gotta find some town  
Some big new town, some bright new town  
Some new town with new places, new lives  
And most of all some new faces  
Gotta find a man, a new man  
  
A man who won't worry 'bout where I go  
A man who won't ask how I learned what I know  
A man who will know that you've gotta be free  
A man who will know when to just let me be  
Gotta move, gotta get out  
  
Gotta change my life, gotta find my life  
I'll find me a place in some new town and baby  
And when I find me that new place, then maybe ours,  
Gotta leave this town  
Gotta leave this place  
Gotta find a new man  
  
Gotta move!


Grandma's hands, clapped in church on Sunday morning  
Grandma's hands, played the tambourine so well  
Grandma's hand used to issue out a warning  
She'd say, "Baby, don't you run so fast  
Might fall on a piece of glass, might be snakes there in my grass"  
Grandma's hands, I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma's hands  
Grandma's hands, soothed the local unwed mother  
My grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell  
Grandma's hands used to lift her face  
And tell her she'd say, "Baby, grandma understands  
But you really loved that man and put herself in Jesus' hands"  
Grandma's hands, yeah, I'm talking, I'm talking 'bout my grandma, yeah  
Grandma's hands used to hand me a piece of candy  
Grandma's hands, picked me up each time I fell  
Grandma's hands, boy, they really came in handy  
She'd say, "Nettie, don't you whip that girl  
What you wanna spank her for she didn't drop no apple-core"  
But I don' have grandma anymore  
If I get to Heaven I'll look for grandma's hands  
I'm talking 'bout my grandma, talking 'bout my grandma, oh yeah  
I'm talking 'bout my grandma, I'm talking 'bout my grandma, yeah  
Grandma, grandma, I'm talking 'bout my grandma  


Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well I'm all grown up now  
Can you still help somehow  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown-up X-mas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
That right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown-up Christmas list  
What is this illusion called  
The innocence of youth  
Maybe only in that blind belief  
Can we ever find the truth  
There'd be no more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And every man would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grow-up X-mas list  
This is my only life-long wish  
This is my grown-up X-mas list....


You say you love me  
I say I love you  
So why don't you stop your cryin'  
Dry your weeping eyes  
You know I love you  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
You say you need me  
I say I need you too  
So why don't you stop your cryin'  
Dry your weeping eyes  
You know I love you  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Ooh rub it baby (repeated to  
Background voices)  
Ooh Rub it over me?.  
(Chorus in background)  
Keep rubbin' on my belly (X2)  
Rub it Rub Rub it?  
Ooh rub it on my belly  
Keep rubbin on my belly (fade)

Shadows falling , baby , we stand alone  
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own  
(It oughta be illegal)  
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad  
(It oughta be illegal)  
You got a reason for livin'  
You battle on with the love you're livin' on  
  
You gotta be mine  
We take it away  
It's gotta be night and say  
Just a matter of time  
And we got nothing to be guilty of  
Our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are  
And we never let it end  
  
We are devotion  
And we got nothing to be sorry for  
Our love is one in a million  
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky  
I don't want to hear your goodbye  
  
Oh!  
Barry  
Aaah!  
Pulse's racing , darling  
How grand we are  
Little by little we meet in the middle  
There's danger in the dark  
(It oughta be illegal)  
Make it a crime to be out in the cold  
(It oughta be illegal)  
You got a reason for livin'  
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on  
  
Together  
You gotta be mine  
We take it away  
It's gotta be night and day  
Just a matter of time  
And we got nothing to be guilty of  
Our love will climb and mountain near or far, we are  
  
And we never let it end  
We are devotion  
And we got nothing to be sorry for  
Our love is one in a million  
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky  
  
Barbra  
I don't want to hear your goodbye  
Barry  
Don't want to hear your goodbye  
Together  
I don't want to hear your  
And we got nothing to be guilty of  
Our love will climb and mountain near or far , we are  
And we never let it end  
  
We are devotion  
And we got nothing to be sorry for  
Our love is one in a million  
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky  
Don't want to hear your goodbye  
Don't want to hear your  
And we got nothing to be guilty of


Christmas' future is far away  
Christmas' past is passed  
Christmas' present is here today  
Bringing joy that will last  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your hearts be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule time gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yoke  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow  
(Hang a shining star)  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
(Have yourself a merry little Christmas now...)


He touched me, he put his hand near mine  
And then he touched me  
I felt a sudden tingle when he touched me  
A sparkle, a glow  
He knew it, it wasn't accidental  
No, he knew it  
He smiled and seem to tell me so all through it  
He knew it, I know  
He's real, and the world is alive and shining  
I feel such a wonderful drive t'wards valentining  
He touched me, I simply have to face the fact  
He touched me  
Control myself and try to act  
As if I remember my name  
But he touched me, he touched me  
And suddenly nothing is the same  
'Cause he touched me, he touched me  
And suddenly nothing, nothing, nothing is the same  


We said we'd try again but tryin' not enough  
Actin' like strangers ain't no way of making love  
It's never gonna work, its time we stopped pretending  
Time to turn the page, all stories need an ending  
It makes no sense to stay  
Living my life in yesterday  
I'm leaving, I'm leaving,  
And I'm begging you  
Heart don't change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
It'll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart, it's hard for you I know  
Let me let him go  
  
Don't let me think about how good it was before  
I know you'd try anything to keep me from that door  
Its hard to leave him when you've loved him for so long now  
How can I walk away if he's still holding on now  
I've found the strength today  
Look at me I can finally say  
It's over, It's over  
So I'm begging you  
  
Heart don't change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
It'll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart, it's hard for you I know  
Let me let him go  
  
It makes no sense to stay  
Sad that it has to end this way  
It's over, It's over  
Heart don't change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
It'll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart, it's hard for you I know  
Let me let him go


I saw you looking in the mirror  
I saw you fighting with your conscious  
I think you need a little time away  
And I may give you mine  
  
And you could find me in the moon glow  
You find me underneath your pillow  
And we can find a little hideaway  
Where we can go  
  
I'm in the corner with a friend of mine  
I stood with my defenses down  
So many things that bring you close to me  
That we be led astray, the wonder of desire  
To love the things we cannot touch  
  
Maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away  
And then the story can go on without a single tear  
You take a chance on it and change the history  
And for a time, we fall in love with someone  
  
So who am I to say the words that say  
We have found each other?  
Can we imagine any hideaway is right?  
And our adventure down in paradise  
Borne upon the wind and we are one with the night  
  
Maybe we shuffle off to Rio  
A little Rio de Janeiro  
And then I get a little chance to say  
I'm falling into you  
  
(One)  
And you and I can change the world if we just try  
(Hideaway)  
This lonely heart of mine has found a mission for your light  
(In your world)  
To make the sense of it and solve the mystery  
(In my arms)  
It's just the love you forever leave with someone  
  
(One)  
So who am I to say the words  
That say we've found each other?  
(Sunny day)  
Can we imagine any hideaway is right?  
(In your world)  
And our adventure down in paradise  
(In my arms)  
Born upon the wind and we are one with the night  
  
And our adventure down in paradise  
Borne upon the wind  
And we are one with the night


Walk me over this horizon  
Let the sun's light warm my face  
Once again the times are changin'  
Once again I lost my way  
Well the words of ancient poets  
Fall like dust upon my shoes  
Greed has robbed me of my vision  
Turned my heart from higher truths  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
I have walked too long in darkness  
I have walked too long alone  
Blindly clutching fists of diamonds  
That I found were only stones  
I would trade the world of ages  
For a warmer hand to hold  
The path of light is narrow  
But it leads to streets of gold  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
In this world we move through shadows  
Never sure of what we see  
While the truth that lies between us  
Come and share the truth with me  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher higher ground  
Hmm hmm hmm hmm


Fanny is now part of the Ziegfeld Follies. She tells  
Florenz Ziegfeld she doesn't want to be in the finale  
because she finds the lyrics inappropriate but  
Ziegfeld insists.  
[Tenor:]  
For better or for worse, "Oh Promise Me,"  
Why does every bride glow ravishingly?  
Within the secret heart of every bride  
These are the words repeating, repeating,  
Repeating inside: (Bing, bong, bing, bong)  
You are the beautiful reflection  
Of his love's affection,  
A walking illustration  
Of his adoration  
His love makes you beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
You ask your looking glass,  
What is it?  
Makes you so exquisite?  
The answer to your query  
Comes back, dearie--  
His love makes you beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
And woman loved is woman glorified!  
You'll make a beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful bride!  
[Chorus:]  
Here comes the bride,  
Another beautiful bride.  
Ziegfeld presents her  
With justifiable pride.  
Fanny enters with a pillow stuffed under her bridal gown  
so that she appears pregnant.  
[Fanny:]  
I am the beautiful reflection  
Of my love's affection,  
A walking illustration  
Of his adoration.  
His love makes me beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
[Tenor:]  
And woman loved is woman glorified--  
[Fanny:]  
I'll make a beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful--  
I'm beautiful? Oy!  
[Chorus:]  
You are so beautiful,  
You are so beautiful,  
You are so beautiful,  
[Tenor:]  
Such a beautiful bride.


Honey, honey, can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you.  
Oh, won't you please let me?  
Because they get to me,  
They touch me and then move me.  
  
I get to thinking I won't be needin'  
Anything more to keep me warm.  
I feel the feeling of you  
Al1 the way through.  
No other feeling will ever do.  
  
Honey, honey,  
Can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you.  
  
They're just like old friends  
When we're together.  
They comfort me and soothe me.  
They're not brand new.  
  
They're a little worn through,  
But they're comfy and roomy.  
They do something to me,  
And when I stay at home,  
And you're far away,  
I won' t be lonely all through the day.  
  
Honey, honey,  
Can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you.  
  
I feel the feeling of you  
All the day through.  
No other feeling will ever do.  
  
Honey, honey,  
Can I put on your clothes?  
Because they feel so good,  
And they feel like you,  
Honey, honey, honey, hum


I don't care much  
Go or stay  
I don't care very much  
Either way  
Hearts grow hard  
On a windy street  
Lips grow cold  
With the rent to meet me  
So if you kiss me  
If we touch  
Warning's fair,  
I don't care very much  
I don't care much  
Go or stay  
I don't care  
Very much  
Either way  
Words sound false  
When your coat's too thin  
Feet don't waltz  
When the roof caves in  
So if you kiss me  
If we touch  
Warning's fair  
I don't care  
Very much


Funny day  
Looking for laughter  
And finding it there  
  
Sunny day  
Braiding wild flowers  
And leaves in her hair  
Picked up a pencil and wrote  
"I love you"  
  
In my finest hand  
I wanted to send it  
But I don't know where I stand  
  
Telephone  
Even the sound of your voice is still new  
All alone in California  
  
I'm talking to you  
I'm feeling too foolish and strange  
To say the words that I had planned  
I guess it's too early  
  
'Cause I don't know where I stand  
Crickets call courting the ladies  
In starred apple green thickets tall  
  
Until the morning  
Comes up like a dream  
How muted and misty  
Such rouse and I'll take  
What sleep I can  
I know that I miss you  
But I don't know where I stand  
I know that I miss you  
But I don't know where I stand


I went looking for a new love  
A different kind of true love  
Who would treat me right  
Day and night  
He baby I went looking too,  
and I found out that there is no other love for me but you  
Just me and you.  
  
I went looking for a new love  
A different kind of true love  
Who's gonna treat me right  
Day and night  
Then I found what I was after  
Now my life is filled with laughter  
I found you love  
  
I was lost with no direction  
And my life was one big question  
I was down and out  
Filled with doubt  
Now I know just where I'm going  
And my happiness is showing  
  
I found you love  
I found you love  
I found the new love  
Wonderful and true  
  
He loves to spend my money  
Likes to call me honey  
I'm gonna please him  
Gonna hug and squeeze him  
He's gonna love me madly  
I'm gonna to love him gladly  
We're gonna hold love while we can  
  
Do, do do do do do do do  
Do, do do do do do do do  
  
I went looking for a new love  
A different kind of true love  
Who's gonna treat me right  
(Every day every night)  
Then I found what I was after  
Now my life is filled with laughter  
  
I found you love  
I found you love  
I found the new love  
Wonderful and true  
He loves to spend my money  
And he loves to call me ho ho honey  
  
I'm gonna please him  
Gonna hug and squeeze him  
He's gonna love me madly  
I'm gonna to love him gladly  
  
We're gonna hold love while we can  
We're gonna hold love while we can  
  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
  
Baby I went looking for a new love  
Different kind of true love  
Who's gonna treat me right (every day and every night)  
  
I found what I was after  
My life is filled with laughter  
Cause I found you love  
Looking for a true love  
Some kind of new love  
Who's gonna treat me right  
He's gonna give me love every night


I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
[Speaking]  
You play real good!  
How old are you? Eight?  
...I was eight once...  
For a whole year!  
Then I went on to the big time...  
Nine...Ten...  
[Singing]  
I got daisies in green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
All man trouble, I don't mind him  
You won't find him  
Round and round and round my door  
I got starlight  
I got sweet dream  
I got my man  
Who can ask for anything more  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man


I had myself a true love  
A true love who was something to see  
I had myself a true love  
At least that's what I kept on telling me  
  
The first thing in the morning  
I still try to think of a way to be with him  
Some part of the evening  
And that's the way I live through the day  
  
I had myself a true love, but now he's gone  
And left me for good  
The lord knows I don't hear those back yard  
Whispers going round the neighborhood  
  
There maybe a lot of things I miss  
A lot of things I don't know  
But I do know this, now I ain't got no love  
And once upon a time I had a true love  
  
In the evening, in the doorway  
While I stand there and wait for his coming  
With the house swept and the clothes hung  
And a pot on the stove where I had meal  
  
Where is he while I waste the rising newel?  
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon?  
Now there ain't no way that it used to be, what now?  
And everybody keeps telling me  
  
There are may be a lot of things I miss  
A lot of things I don't know  
But I do know this now...  
I ain't got no love  
  
And once upon a time I had a true love.


Nothing is so good it lasts eternally  
Perfect situations must go wrong  
But this has never yet prevented me  
Wanting far too much for far too long.  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
One of few more moments who can tell  
But it took time to understand the man  
Now at least I know I know him well.  
Wasn't it good? Oh so good  
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?  
But in the end he needs  
A little bit more than me  
More She needs security  
He needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well.  
  
No one in your life is with you constantly  
No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide.  
  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
Could have played things some other way.  
Learn about the man before I fell  
I was just a little careless  
But I was ever so much younger then.  
I was so much younger then  
Now at least I know I know him well  
Wasn't it good? Oh so good  
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine  
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?  
Didn't I know how it would go?  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart?  
Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness  
He won't be mine?  
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me  
More She needs security  
He needs his Fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
It took time to understand me  
I know him so well.


I like him, I like him,  
How strange the feeling, I like him.  
I never dreamed it could be.  
He's foolish, unworldly and yet appealing, I like him.  
I feel alive and free.  
How did the birds and the bees outsmart me?  
Who's little arrows are these that dart, dart, dart me?  
I like him, I like him,  
Up to the ceiling, I like him.  
He's for me, A to Zee.  
I like him, I like him and he likes me.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I never dreamed it could be.  
He's foolish, unworldly and yet appealing I like him.  
He's for me, A to Zee.  
I like him, I like him and he likes me.


Here comes another dawn  
For every child to see  
This time the morning sun  
Is burning just for me  
I've got the skyward eyes  
Like I've never had before  
Just smile and say goodbye  
  
Show me to the door  
For every one there comes a precious time  
To break away  
I mean to shine  
Oh, I mean to shine  
As I look at all the morning sun  
I know I mean to shine  
  
This day I realized  
The world I knew is gone  
New seasons come and change  
The crown that stood upon  
I've been afraid to feel  
And scared of falling free  
You said so I'm real  
It seemed so clear to me  
For everyone who breathes  
There comes a time to fly away  
  
I mean to shine  
0h, I mean to shine  
As I look at all the morning sun  
I know I mean to shine  
For everyone who breathes  
  
There comes a time  
To break away  
I mean to shine  
Oh, I mean to shine  
As I look at all morning sun  
I know I mean to shine.


I never had much money  
I never won a race  
My jokes don't end that funny  
And I had door slammed on my face  
But I think you've charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
  
No, I never had it so good  
I'm not the type that's trusted  
Always tripping over logs  
And often I've been busted  
And chased by friendly dogs  
But I think you've charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
  
No, I never had it so good  
Hm,  
But I think you've charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
No, I never had it so good


I done lost my ugly spare  
I am cheerful now  
Got the warmth all over  
To smoother my worried brow  
Oh, the girl I use to be  
She ain't me no more  
I closed the door  
On the girl I was before, hmm  
Feelin' fine and full of bliss  
What I really wanna say is this  
I never has seen snow  
All the same I know  
Snow ain't so beautiful  
Can't be so beautiful  
Like my love is  
Like my love is  
Nothin' do compare  
Nothin' anywhere with my love  
A hundred things I see  
A twilight sky, that tree  
But none so beautiful  
Not one so beautiful  
Like my love is  
Like my love is  
Once you see his face  
None can take the place of my love  
A stone rolled of my heart  
When I laid my eyes on that  
Near to me boy with that far away look  
And right from the start I saw a new horizon  
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took  
Needed to be took  
Needed to be took  
Oh, oh  
I never have seen snow  
All the same I know  
Nothin' will ever be  
Nothin' can ever be  
Beautiful as my love is  
Like my love is to me  
Nothin' is as beautiful to me  


I never meant to hurt you  
I'm not that way at all  
Please believe the words of the heart  
A heart that seems so small  
And I swear I never meant to hurt you  
I guess I lost my place  
Please, believe the wards of the heart  
A heart that hides its fails  
  
Why do I do things  
I never mean to do?  
Oh, why did I speak so carelessly  
When all that i felt  
Was love for you?  
  
And I swear I never  
I never meant to hurt you  
I've got to make you know  
Please, believe the words of the heart  
A heart that didn't show  
I never meant to hurt you  
I only meant to love you  
It's true  
And when I saw you crying  
I cried too


I awake on a chilly Christmas morning  
Watching choirs singing carols on TV  
I gaze out through my window at a dozen other windows  
Then I plug in my artificial tree  
And like a dream I begin to remember every Christmas I used to know  
A thousand miles away, a million years ago  
I remember sky.  
It was blue as ink  
Or at least I think  
I remember sky  
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks  
Coming down like lint  
And it made you squint when the wind would blow  
And ice like vinyl on the streets  
Cold as silver, white as sheets  
Rain like strings and changing things  
Like leaves  
I remember leaves  
Green as spearmint  
Crisp as paper  
I remember trees  
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas  
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos  
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes  
Light and noise and bees and boys  
And daaaaays, oh!  
I remember days or at least I try  
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze  
And the bluest ink isn't really sky.  
And at times I think I would gladly die  
For a day of sky!


I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come for die  
For poor orn'ry people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
When Mary birthed Jesus, t'was in a cow'stall  
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all  
And high from gods heaven a starlight did fall  
And the promise of ages, it then did recall  
  
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing  
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing  
Or all of gods angels in heaven to sing  
He surely could've had it, 'cause he was the king  
  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
I wonder as I wander  
  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come for die  
For poor orn'ry people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
I wonder as I wander out under the, sky


I have dreams for you and me  
And wishes that will last  
And live beyond eternity  
  
Summer's gone, winter's on  
Can we weather everything  
Our eyes have yet to see'  
  
As the years go by  
I promise you that I  
  
I will be the one to run to  
When the nights are long  
I'll be there when winds begin to blow  
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong  
  
This I swear  
I swear  
I won't be the one to let go  
  
Life gets tough  
Ooh  
Roads get rough  
Ooh  
  
Who knows what awaits us 'round the bend  
Count on me, faithfully  
Though everything we have could never end  
It could never end  
  
And through rain or shine  
And every cloudy sky  
  
I will be the one to run to  
When the nights are long  
I'll be there when winds begin to blow  
Even when it seems that everything is going wrong  
  
This I swear  
This I swear  
I won't be the one to let go  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Anytime you need me you'll know where I am  
  
you'll know just where I am and everywhere  
Everywhere  
Anytime you're lost just turn around  
Just turn around  
  
And take my hand and  
I will be your light in the night  
And I promise that even when it seems  
That everything is going wrong  
  
This I swear  
This I swear  
I won't be the one  
To let go  
To let go  
  
This I swear  
I swear  
I won't be the one to let go  
To let  
Go


Day after day I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care, you're always there  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
So, many times when the city seems to be without  
A friendly face, a lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringing  
I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near  
And love, if all my friends have forgotten half their promises  
They're not unkind, just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live  
Without the rest, I found the best  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
No, I won't last a day without you  
Can't last a day without you  


I'd rather be blue, thinking of you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
I'm crazy about ya, without ya  
For you, I'm strong  
I can't do without ya  
Oucha-ma-goucha, don't stay too long  
  
I need a little ah, little ooh, little oh  
And I'm knocking on wood  
Honey, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up  
It's so hard to be good  
  
I'd rather be blue, thinking of you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Will I be good? Will I be bad?  
Don't be a fool, you fool  
My little flat, I'm turning that  
Into a Sunday school  
  
While you're away, I'm here to say  
There'll be no ice man there  
Singing the blues I'm gonna use  
Nothing but Frigidaire  
  
I'd rather be blue, thinking of you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Blue over you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be Hap-hap-hap-happy  
With somebody else


If a girl isn't pretty  
Like a Miss Atlantic City  
All she gets in life is pity  
And a pat  
Kindly name a star who hasn't  
Won a contest or a pageant  
If she hasn't she just never  
Gets to bat  
She must shine in every detail  
Like a ring, you're buying retail  
Be a standard size that  
Fits a standard dress  
When a girl's incidentals  
Are no bigger than two lentils  
Then to me it doesn't spell  
Success  
Frumpy faces that could cause ya  
To have temporary nausea  
Do I have to hear a lecture  
Such as that?  
Is a nose with deviation  
Such a crime against the nation?  
Should I throw her into jail  
Or drown the cat?  
So she looks a bit off balance  
She possesses golden talents  
Or is that a pill too bitter  
To digest?  
Oh, she's got very nice deportment, hmm  
But when they see that at Ortmund's  
From the gallery they'll be  
Throwing fruit  


If I close my eyes, I can fly.  
I can drink the rain and taste the sky.  
I can catch the wind and make it mine.  
Like the sun, I'll shine.  
Suddenly a door opens wide,  
To a thousand paths I've never tried.  
Follow, follow me, I hear them say,  
And you'll find your way.  
Maybe dreams are dreamed, so that we can see,  
Just how real the dawn can be.  
How the dawn can be, comes as no surprise,  
If I simply close my eyes.


If I Could  
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes  
Give you courage in a world of compromise  
Yes I would  
If I could  
I would teach you all the things I've never learned  
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned  
Yes I would  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I've watched you grow  
So I could let you go  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
If I live in a time and place where you don't want to be  
You don't have to walk along this road with me  
My yesterday won't have to be your way  
If I knew  
How I'd try to change the world I brought you to  
And there isn't very much that I can do  
But I would  
If I could  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But that part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I watched you grow so I could let you go  
If, if I could  
I would help you make it through those hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
Yes I would  
Yes I would  
If I could


If i didn't love you  
I'd be safe from harm.  
I would never find myself  
Lost inside your arms.  
If i didn't love you  
I'd never feel the pain  
Of sunny days without you  
Drowning in the rain.  
If i didn't love you  
  
If i didn't love you  
Peace would rule the day  
All the dark and out would surely go away.  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't pay the cost  
Of living every endless day  
If our love is lost.  
If i didn't love you  
If i didn't love you  
  
And yet you make me breathless  
At the way you move  
I never knew that i  
Could ever love the way we do.  
I don't know how you reach me  
In that place in my heart  
Belonging to only you.  
  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't lose control  
The danger loving brings a word  
Never touch my soul.  
If i didn't love you  
Perhaps i wouldn't die.  
If you should ever say to me  
"i'm sorry, goodbye."  
If i didn't love you  
How can there be music  
In the way you touch?  
I can't believe that somehow  
I believe in you so much.  
Now you've come and taught me  
How to give you my heart.  
And make me feel at last  
That the end will never start.  
You're the only reason  
I'm not afraid to fall.  
For if i didn't love you  
If i didn't love you  
I wouldn't love at all.


Fanny  
I often wonder why he came to me  
Brought such a flame to me  
Then let it die  
  
And if another love should find my heart  
It will remind my heart of your goodbye  
With every new love  
You'll come back to me  
  
In other eyes it's you I see  
If I love again  
Though it's someone new  
If I love again  
  
It will still be you  
In someone else's firm embrace  
I close my eyes but see your face  
If I love again  
I'll find another charms  
But I'll make believe  
  
You are in my arms  
And though my lips whisper "love me!"  
My heart will not be true  
I'll be loving you  
Every time i love again...


If I never met you  
If I never saw your face  
This world, this world would be a colder place, I bet.  
If we'd never met...  
If I never met you  
If I never knew your love  
My life, my life might be a sad song of regret.  
If we'd never met...  
But we said one "hello."  
And look at how the world begins to spin  
Look at how the shadows disappear  
Now that you are here.  
If I never met you  
If I never felt your kiss  
My days, my nights would not be filled like this, it's true.  
I don't know who I'd love  
I don't know what I'd do if I never met you.  
Just look at how the shadows disappear  
Now that you are here.  
If I never met you  
If I never felt your kiss  
My days, my nights would be filled like this, it's true.  
I don't know who I'd love  
I don't know what I'd do  
If I never met you.  
I don't know who I'd love  
I don't know what I'd do  
If I never met you.  
"we must be loving right"  
Some folks got nothin' but troubles  
So little joy in their lives.  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows.  
We must be lovin' right.  
It might be the way I adore you.  
Or the way that you hold me tight.  
I don't know the reason  
But I'm believin'  
We must be lovin' right  
All of our friends say  
Love fades away with time.  
But I know they're wrong  
'Cause they've never known  
A love like yours and mine.  
So if the whole world goes crazy  
Let everyone else fuss and fight.  
When all's said and done  
We'll be the lucky ones.  
We must be lovin' right.  
Some folks got nothin' but troubles.  
Oh so little joy in their lives.  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows.  
We must be lovin' right.  
We must be lovin' right.


If you could read my mind, love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well  
  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
You know that ghost is me  
And I will never be set free  
As long as I am  
A ghost that you can see  
  
If I could read your mind, love  
What a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paperback novel  
That kind the drugstores sell  
  
When you reach the part  
Where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me  
The heroes often fail  
And you won't red that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take  
I'd walk away like a movie star  
Who gets spurned in a three-way script  
Ends up number two  
The movie queen to play the scene  
And bringing all the good things out in me  
But now for love, lets be real  
I never thought I could feel this way  
And I got to say  
That I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back  
  
If you could read my mind, love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well  
  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
Stories always end  
And if you read between the lines  
You know that I'm just trying to understand  
The feelings that you lack  
I've never thought I could feel this way  
And I've got to say  
That I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back


Vince  
When I fall, you're my place to land.  
I lose my touch, you're my hands,  
The one I hold on to.  
If you run out of reason to try  
I'll love enough for both you and I  
I'll be the one you can run to.  
Barbra  
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through  
Than to spend one day without you by my side.  
Both  
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?  
If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too.  
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.  
My love's inside you, even more than you know.  
  
Barbra  
In a world of anger and lies  
I find peace in your eyes  
A flame in the darkness.  
  
Both  
Ooh, And through all space and time  
'Til every star refuses to shine  
  
Barbra  
You know where my heart is.  
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through  
  
Both  
Than to spend one day without you by my side  
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?  
If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too, Woah.  
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.  
  
Barbra  
Where you may go  
  
Both  
My love's inside you, even more than you know.  
  
And I can't remember life without you  
The way it used to be  
Feels like a million years away.  
  
Vince  
Well Hold me 'til the angels sing.  
  
Barbra  
Tell me every little thing.  
  
Both  
Promise me forever from this day  
  
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?  
If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too, Woah.  
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.  
  
Vince  
Where you may go  
  
Both  
My love's inside you, even more than you know.  
  
Barbra  
Even more than you know.  
  
Vince  
Even more than you know.  
  
Both  
Even more than you know.  
Even more than you know.


I'll be home  
I'll be home  
When your nights are troubled  
And you're all alone  
When you're feeling down  
And need some sympathy  
Nobody's around to keep you company  
Remember baby  
You can always count on me  
I'll be home  
I'll be home  
I'll be home  
Hum... I'll be home  
Wherever you may wander  
Wherever you may roam  
You'll come back  
And I'll be waiting here for you  
No one else will ever love you  
The way I do  
I'll be here to comfort you  
And see you through  
I'll be home  
I'll be home  
I'll be home


I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even than more than I usually do  
And although I know  
  
It's long road back  
I promise you  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents round the tree  
Christmas eve is gonna find me  
  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
  
You can count on me  
Please have some snow  
And lots of mistletoe  
And presents round that tree  
  
Christmas eve is gonna find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
If only in my dreams....


I'll know when my love comes along  
I'll know then and there  
I'll know at the sight of his face  
How I care, how I care, how I care  
And I'll stop, and I'll stare, and I'll know  
Long before we can speak  
I'll know in my heart  
I will know and I won't ever ask  
Am I right, am I wise, am I smart?  
But I but I'll stop and I'll stare  
At that face in the throng  
Yes, I'll know when my love comes along  
That he'll stand before my eyes one day  
I won't need a second glance his way  
I'll know when my love comes along  
I'll know then and there  
I'll know at the sight of his face  
How I care, how I care, how I care  
And I'll stop, and I'll stare at that face in the throng  
Yes, I'll know when my love comes along  


I won't to tell of my love  
To the red, red rose  
Or the running brook  
Where the sweet magnolia grows  
  
I won't tell of my love  
To every little star  
Or the whippoorwill  
On the hill above  
  
I'll tell the man in the street  
And everyone I meet  
That you and I are sweethearts  
I'll shout it out  
From the roof  
  
I'll give the papers proof  
That we two are complete hearts  
I want the world to know  
I'd use the radio  
  
And when I've said all I say  
You may be old and gray  
But you can't get away from me.


It's a funny thing.  
I look at you.  
I get a thrill  
I never knew.  
  
Isn't it a pity  
We never met before?  
Here we are at last.  
It's like a dream.  
  
The two of us  
A perfect team.  
Isn't it a pity  
We never met before?  
  
Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted.  
Me with the neighbors.  
You at silly labors.  
What joys untasted.  
  
My nights were sour,  
Spent with Schopenhauer  
Let's forget the past.  
Let's both agree  
  
That I'm for you  
And you're for me.  
And it's such a pity  
We never, never met before.  
  
Imagine all the years we've wasted.  
Fishing for salmon  
Losing at backgammon.  
What joys untasted.  
  
Me at the Prado,  
You in Colorado.  
Happiest of girls I'm sure to be  
If only you would say to me  
  
That it's such a pity  
We never met before.  
What an awful pity  
We never, never met before.


Seems like dreams like I always had  
Could be, should be making me glad  
Why am I blue?  
It's up to you to explain  
  
I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away  
Someday, some way, you'll come and say it's you I need  
And you'll be pleading in vain  
It had to be you, had to be you  
  
I wondered around, finally found somebody who  
Could make me be true, could make me be blue  
And even be glad just to be sad  
Thinking of you  
  
Some others I've seen  
Might never be mean, might never be cross  
I tried to be boss, but they wouldn't do  
'Cause nobody else gave ma a thrill  
  
With all your faults I love you still  
Had to be you, crazy old you, had to be you


[Cornelius:]  
It only takes a moment  
For your eyes to meet and then  
Your heart knows in a moment  
You will never be alone again  
I held her for an instant  
But my arms felt sure and strong  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long...  
Clerk:  
I missed a few words back there, Mr. Hackl.  
Right after 'it only'...  
  
[All in docket:]  
...Takes a moment!  
But his arms felt sure and strong  
It only takes a moment  
  
[Mrs. Molloy:]  
He held me for an instant  
But his arms felt safe and strong  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long  
  
[Cornelius:]  
And that is all  
That love's about  
  
[Mrs. Molloy:]  
And we'll recall when time runs out  
  
[Both:]  
That it only took a moment  
To be loved a whole life long!


[Frank:]  
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie  
All the day and night-time hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion  
That I could fall with so much emotion  
[Barbra:]  
I wonder... Could you coo, now, could you care  
For a cozy cottage we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you  
[Barbra:] I've got a crush on you,  
[Frank:] I've got a crush on you,  
[Barbra:] Sweetie pie  
[Frank:] Sweetie pie  
[Barbra:] All the day and night-time  
[Frank:] All the day and night-time  
[Barbra:] Hear me sigh  
[Frank:] Hear me sigh  
[Both:] I never had the least notion  
[Frank:] That I could fall with...  
[Barbra:] I'd fall with...  
[Frank:] So much...  
[Barbra:] So much emotion  
[Frank:] So much emotion  
Could you coo?  
[Barbra:] I could coo!  
[Frank:] Could you possibly care?  
[Barbra:] I could care!  
[Frank:] For a lovely cottage...  
[Barbra:] Ooo that cottage  
[Both:] That we could share!  
The world will pardon my mush  
[Frank:] Yes, I have got a crush, my Barbra, on you!  
[Barbra:] You will make me blush, Francis!  
[Frank:] Yes!  
[Both:] I have got a crush, my baby, on you...


Why does the gay little dicky bird sing?  
What put the "zing" in a butterfly's wing?  
What's the reason for the smile of a troubadour?  
Why does a breeze have a barrel of fun?  
Even the bee who's a son-of-a-gun,  
It's all because they're free  
And stringless, the same as me  
  
I've got no strings to hold me down  
To make me fret  
Or make me frown  
  
I had strings but now I'm free  
There are no strings on me  
  
Hi-o the merri-o  
I'm as happy as can be  
I want the world to know  
Nothing ever worries me  
  
I've got no strings so I have fun  
I'm not tied up to anyone  
How I love my liberty  
There are no strings on me  
  
I've got no strings so I have fun  
I'm not tied up to anyone  
How I love my liberty  
There are no strings on me


She's real fine, my 4-0-9  
She's real fine, my 4-0-9  
My 4--0--9  
  
Well, I saved my pennies and I saved my dimes (Giddyup, giddyup, 4-0-9)  
For I knew there would be a time (Giddyup, giddyup, 4-0-9)  
When I would buy a brand new 4-0-9 (4-0-9, 4-0-9)  
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, 4-0-9  
Giddyup, 4-0-9  
Giddyup, 4-0-9  
Giddyup, 4-0  
Nothing can catch her, nothing can touch my 4-0-9, 4-0-9  
  
(Oooo, giddyup, giddyup)  
(Oooo, giddyup, giddyup)  
(Oooo, giddyup, giddyup)  
(Oooo, giddyup, giddyup)  
  
When I take her to the track she really shines (Giddyup, giddyup, 4-0-9)  
She always turns in the fastest time (Giddyup, giddyup, 4-0-9)  
My four-speed, dual-quad, posi-traction 4-0-9 (4-0-9, 4-0-9)  
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, 4-0-9  
Giddyup, 4-0-9  
Giddyup, 4-0-9  
Giddyup, 4-0  
Nothing can catch her, nothing can touch my 4-0-9, 4-0-9


Born of the age  
Flagged hopes  
Censored rage  
The black clad box  
Bombs bursting in air  
Bleed white red and blue  
Cried dawn's early light  
For the hope  
  
Oh where has it gone  
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try  
Reaching the spacious ski-ies  
Fourth of July  
  
Lie by the sword  
Black times  
False reward  
The greetings of doom  
So proudly they hail  
Lost fortune of free  
The stripes and bright stars  
Promise lost  
  
Oh where has it gone  
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try  
Reaching the spacious ski-ies  
Fourth of July  
  
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try  
Reaching the spacious ski-ies  
Fourth of July

Feel the wind burn through my skin  
The pain, the air is killing me  
For years my limbs stretched to the sky  
A nest for birds to sit and sing  
  
But now my branches suffer  
And my leaves don't bear the glow  
They did so long ago  
  
One day I was full of life  
My sap was rich and I was strong  
From seed to tree I grew so tall  
Through wind and rain I could not fall  
  
But now my branches suffer  
And my leaves don't offer  
Poetry to men of song  
  
Trees like me weren't meant to live  
If all this world can give  
Pollution and slow death  
  
Oh Lord I lay me down  
No life's left to be found  
There's nothing left for me  
  
Trees like me weren't meant to live  
If all this earth can give  
Is pollution  
  
Trees like me weren't meant to live  
(Oh Lord I lay me down)  
If all this earth can give  
(My branches to the ground)  
Is pollution and slow death  
(There's nothing left for me)  
  
Oh Lord I lay me down  
My branches to the ground  
There's nothing left for me


When I see my baby  
When I see my little girl  
When I see my woman  
I'm gonna tell her about the lonely hours I just spent  
And say the thing we got going hope it never ends  
Well I'm gonna tell that little girl a thing or two  
  
Do it right baby  
(Do it right baby)  
Ahhh haaa  
Outta sight baby  
Ahhh-ha ha  
Do it right baby  
(Do it right baby)  
Ahhh haaa  
  
When I see my baby  
When I look in her pretty eyes  
When I get with my darling baby  
I say my heart will start to beat like a couple of drums  
She'll get my temperature to rise to 'bout a hundred and one  
  
(Yeah)  
Do it right baby  
(Do it right baby)  
Ahhh haaa  
Outta sight baby  
Ahhh-ha ha  
Do it right baby  
(Do it right baby)  
Ahhh haaa  
  
A whole day away from your woman  
A separation from your girl can really mess your mind  
And can you dig this one thing  
Well it's lucky I'm working from nine to five  
I have to live with my doctors just to keep me alive  
Keep on tellin' a thing or two  
  
Do it right baby  
(Do it right baby)  
Ahhh haaa  
Outta sight baby  
Ahhh-ha ha  
Do it right baby  
(Do it right baby)  
Ahhh haaa


The sunday mornin' gospel goes good with the soul  
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rollin' stone  
The world could come together as one  
If everybody under the sun  
Add some music to your day  
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)  
A bob didit a bop didit  
  
You'll hear it while you're walkin' by a neighbor's home  
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone  
You're sittin' in a dentist's chair  
And they've got music for you there  
To add some music  
(Add some music add some add some music to your)  
To your day  
A bob didit a bop didit  
  
Add some music music everywhere (add some music)  
Add some add some add some add some music (add some music)  
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm  
Your preacher adds it to his psalms  
So add some music  
(Add some music add some add some music to your)  
To your day  
  
Music  
(Add some music add some music)  
When you're alone  
(Add some music add some music)  
Is like a companion  
(Add some music add some music)  
For your lonely soul  
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo  
  
When day is over (when day is over)  
I close my tired eyes (I close my tired)  
Music is in my soul  
  
At a movie you can feel it touching your heart  
And on every day of the summertime  
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts  
They'll play it on your wedding day  
There must be 'bout a million ways  
To add some music  
(Add some music add some add some music to your)  
To your day  
  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day


Over the city in an airplane  
I can see everything below  
The houses they look so tiny  
The cars look like dots  
We've only got fifteen minutes to go  
  
The clouds in the sky caress my mind so tenderly  
The sun shines down on the great big beautiful scene  
  
The sound of the engine fills my ears up  
I'm hopin' this rainy weather clears up  
My lover is waiting at the airport  
Soon she'll be kissing me hello  
  
The woman sitting next to me tells me 'bout her guy  
And I tell her all about you and I  
  
Airplane, airplane  
Carry me back to her side  
Airplane, airplane  
I need God as my guide  
Down, down on the ground  
Can't wait to see her face  
  
(a-1, a-2, a-1, 2, 3)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)  
I can't wait (can't wait)  
To see (her face)

Well she first caught my eye a runnin' round in shorts  
But she never bothered with her hair  
Just a barefooted chick with all skinned up knees  
Yeah she didn't care what she'd wear  
(All dressed up for school)  
  
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on

All summer long she had a crush on me  
But I just couldn't care at all  
But new to school threads really did it for me  
Yeah she's turned into a doll  
(All dressed up for school)  
  
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on  
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on

Goes out every night 'cause she's a sharp little doll  
And the guys can't leave her alone  
Now she hardly finds the time to talk to me  
She's not the little girl I've always known  
(All dressed up for school)  
  
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on

Daybreak and I take a glide  
Into the pool of peace inside  
(Two waves travel by)  
To waves and I both travel by  
(And that makes all the difference to me)  
  
Life supporting waves of bliss  
Mother Divine's precious kiss  
Brings with love the light of wisdom  
And the gift of eternal freedom  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
(... and the nature of man...)  
And that makes all the difference to me

All this is that  
I am that, thou art that, all this is that  
I am that, thou art that, all this is that

Dusk time the shadows fall  
Into the timeless time of all  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
Golden auras glow around you  
Omnipresent love surrounds you  
Wisdom warming as the sun  
You and I are truly one  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
And that makes all the difference to me

Let's take your car and to amusement parks USA  
At Palisades in Salisbury park the roller coasters are flyin  
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin'  
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground  
Then take her on the Twirl-A-Way and spin her around  
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day  
  
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day  
And Disneyland and p.o.p. is worth a trip to L.A.  
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad  
And I'll bet the laughin' lady makes you laugh like mad  
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks step right up to the beach boy circus.  
The best little show in town.  
Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, just one tenth of
a dollar.  
Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer (is it real?)  
She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a snake.  
(she looks like a fake to me) (let's go see her) (it costs too much)  
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella.  
She shimmies, she shakes  
  
You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's Steel Pier  
You'll crack 'em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors  
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride  
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side  
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day


Oo ooo ooo ooo ooo  
Now the puzzle's laid out on my table  
The pieces don't fit  
I move from chair to chair  
But that empty one's there where she used to sit  
I'm sitting here going out of my mind  
'Cause she's gone away  
She couldn't wait, now I  
I'm afraid it's too late  
I'm waitin' till my angel comes home  
It's been hell bein' here alone  
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home  
Angel, angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel come home  
Oo oo oo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Does she remember  
That I can't forget  
Does she know I regret  
I never told her how I  
I wanted to hold her  
I just let her go  
Lonely nights thinkin'  
It's starting to sink in  
We had a way to go  
We'll grow closer together  
By being apart  
When my angel comes home  
It's been hell bein' here alone  
God tell me, why has she flown  
So far away  
I pray she won't stay another day  
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home  
Please come home  
Angel, come home  
If you see her tell my angel come home  
Hoo ooo angel, come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Hey hey angel, come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Ho oo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Hey angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
If you see that girl my angel come home  
Hey hey angel come home

Birds fly up  
And down spinnin' round  
Flyin' all around  
From my window  
A little brown sparraw came  
Flutterin' down  
  
Le moineau est venu  
Se poser ma fenjtre  
  
He came to my window  
  
And as I watched him  
I found myself reelin' and turnin' around  
And the faster I ran  
I ran out of breath and I fell to the ground  
(Poof)  
  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
  
He came to my window  
He came to my window  
He came to my window  
  
From their eyes  
The people must look like miniature toys  
  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Fly away  
Fly away  
Fly away


Should old acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind  
Should old acquaintance be forgot  
And days of Auld Lang Syne  
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear

Thank you very much.  
  
May old acquaintance be forgot  
And days of Auld Lang Syne


Lie alone in bed at night  
Feel the pull of a lonely day  
Thoughts like music start to play  
I wonder where you were today  
  
(Baby blue)  
Baby baby blue  
Baby blue eyes I dream of you  
  
Late at night  
When the whole world's sleeping  
I dream of you  
Close to you I feel your sweet heart beating  
I dream of you  
  
Late at night late at night  
Honey late at night I dream of you  
I dream of you  
  
Baby baby blue  
Baby blue eyes I love you new  
I hold you in my dreams tonight  
Hold you 'til morning light

It's been such a long day so you better hurry home  
Lit all my incense and I wish you were home  
Only five minutes and you walk through my door  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life full  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life  
  
Stay here on the weekend and unplug the phone  
(alright then)  
No calls from Korthoff, Parks, or Grillo  
I only hope that you come here alone  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life full  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life


You know, you know you are  
Be still and know you are  
Your life is meant for joy  
It's all so deep within, oh  
  
Your life is beautiful  
A seed becomes a tree  
A mountain into a sky  
This life is meant to be, oh  
  
Now is the time life begins  
Take that simple path  
And love will set you free  
Live in harmony  
And love will set you free, oh  
  
You know, you know you are  
Be still and know you are  
You know, you know you are  
Be still and know you are


When some loud braggart tries to put me down  
And says his school is great

You're going out tonight  
You put your real cool looking clothes on  
You're getting uptight  
About some little thing I said  
  
All that I said  
"I couldn't play the game"  
It shouldn't make any difference to you  
  
Go walking around night  
The wind's really blowing  
It's too cold to talk  
I wonder if she's knowing  
  
She should be with me  
It could set her free  
Come with me  
Be with me  
A part of me

Da da da da da da da da da da

A new child is born  
The mother is still waiting  
Father's over there anticipating  
Won't you be with me  
It could set you (us) free  
Come with me  
Be with me  
A part of me

I, I love the colorful clothes she wears  
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair  
I hear the sound of a gentle word  
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations  
She's giving me excitations  
Good good good good vibrations  
(Oom bop bop)

A bushy bushy blonde hairdo  
Surfin' you. S. A.  
  
Well she got her daddy's car  
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man now  
And with the radio blasting  
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now  
And she'll have fun fun fun  
'Til her daddy took the T-Bird away  
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)  
Ooo-wee ooo-weeoo  
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)  
Ooo-wee ooo-weeoo

We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
  
Woke me up before dawn  
Wish I could sleep some more so I could carry on  
With the dream I've been meaning to make come true  
And that's to get away with you  
  
I think we all can agree  
That there's no better place for us to be  
We can drive on for miles till we're finally free  
It'll just be you and me  
  
We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
  
South Bay surfing again  
Haven't been this way in I don't know when  
If I have my say we'll be back again  
Where the good times never end  
  
We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I wanna be  
With the surfers, sand, and the sea  
  
We'll find a place in the sun  
Where everyone can have fun  
  
Beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
With the surfers, sand, and the sea  
  
We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
Beaches in mind


Bells are ringing, soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
see'est tres jolie en Paris in the spring  
Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine  
Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well  
Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle  
Bells are ringing, soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
There's a chapel "Sacre Coure" in quaint Montmarte  
In the open air the painters show their art  
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies  
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day  
Bells are ringing, soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
Sunday morning, hear the bells of Notre Dame  
Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes  
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees  
Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe  
Some people go to see the races at Deauville  
Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle  
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus  
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse  


The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling  
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring  
And little children everywhere are caroling  
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
The bells of Notre Dame cathedral will chime  
And everywhere a princely peace  
And there they light the candles up one at a time  
For the ones they love at Christmastime  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
The omnipresent spirit of the world will sing  
That Christ is born  
Oh oh oh  
And people of the world are all rejoicing  
For the baby Jesus born in Nazarene  
The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling  
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring  
And little Children everywhere are caroling  
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
Ah

(Pied Piper)  
(I'd better get back in bed)  
(Hope I'll see you again)  
  
(Pied Piper)  
(I'd better get back in bed)  
(Hope I'll see you again)  
  
(Pied Piper)  
(I'd better get back in bed)  
(Hope I'll see you again)  
  
(Pied Piper)  
(I'll be running along)  
  
Thirty seconds after he was in bed  
He fell back to sleep  
  
The next morning  
He had forgotten all about  
What had happened the night before  
  
But when night time came once again  
His thoughts somehow found their way back  
To remembering the fascinating episode of the night before  
  
He he turned out his bedroom light  
And sat in his favorite chair  
Thoughts danced in his head for a while  
"Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there"  
He said "I wonder what would happen"


Do do do do do do do do do  
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens  
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea  
With the granite cliff  
(Big Sur mount)  
  
As a referee  
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns  
A mother deer with their newborn fawns  
All under Big Sur skies  
(Big Sur mount)  
That's where I belong.  
  
Big Sur I've got plans for you  
Me and mine are going to  
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers  
(Big Sur mount)  
  
And live in canyons covered in springtime green  
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen  
And with my old guitar  
I'll make up songs to sing.  
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside  
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside  
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide  
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be  
Where the rugged mountain meets the water  
  
And so while stars shine brightly from up above  
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove  
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log.  
  
From time to time I must go away  
The thoughts of Big Sur won't let me stay  
Away from Big Sur  
Oh Big Sur


I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue thinkin' about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain  
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'  
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, Clue christmas  
  
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas


I found my thrill  
On blueberry hill

When I found you  
  
The moon stood still (moon stood still)

Love's sweet melody  
But all those vows you made  
Were never to be  
  
Though we're apart (we are apart)  
I think of you still (think of you still)  
For you were my friend (you were my friend)  
On blueberry hill

Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
A boy and a girl they once found love  
To each it seemed like heaven above  
He looked into her eyes and said  
Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head  
  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me

Please give me a helping hand  
If you see her all alone  
Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"  
  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
Oh bring my baby back  
I don't know why she's been so long  
But all I know is that she's gone  
Oh bring my baby back to me  
Well I'm in pain can't you see  
  
A boy and a girl they once found love  
To each it seemed like heaven above  
I guess that's why we fell in love  
And now she's gone and all I have to say is  
  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the sea yeah  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
Bring my baby  
Oooo baby  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo

Where did your long hair go  
Where is the girl I used to know  
How could you lose that happy glow  
Oh, Caroline no  
  
Who took that look away  
I remember how you used to say  
You'd never change, but that's not true  
Oh, Caroline you  
  
Break my heart  
I want to go and cry  
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die  
Oh, Caroline why  
  
Could I ever find in you again  
The things that made me love you so much then  
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone  
Oh, Caroline no


Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
The wildest short around is my cherry, cherry coupe  
It's the sharpest thing in town and the envy of my group  
It's one of its kind and it really looks good  
Chopped nose and deck with louvers on the hood  
  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(my cherry coupe beats 'em up coming off the line)  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(and she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)  
  
Chrome reversed rims with whitewall slicks  
And it turns a quarter mile in one oh six  
Door handles are off but you know i'll never miss 'em  
They open when i want with the "cellunoid" system  
  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(my cherry coupe beats 'em up coming off the line)  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(and she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)  
  
My coupe's tuck and roll underneath the hood  
And the rugs, seats, and panels now are looking good  
When i go looking for something to do  
She's got enough room now to barely seat two  
  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(my cherry coupe beats 'em up coming off the line)  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now

The Christmas spirit grows with each new day  
And it's so close but seems so far away  
And yet it comes only once a year  
And 'fore you know it, it's already here  
The streets are filled with laughter  
And so many hearts are gay  
  
Everybody helps to make the spirit bright  
The houses turn on their Christmas lights at night  
It's worth the wait the whole year through  
Just to make happy someone like you  
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day  
  
It's worth the wait the whole year through  
Just to make happy someone like you  
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day  
  
It's worth the wait the whole year through  
Just to make happy someone like you


It's that time of year again  
That Christmas time feelin' is here again  
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again  
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
I see snow flurries comin' down  
Paint a pretty party scene all over town  
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again  
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
Lots of mistletoe hangin' everywhere  
Plenty of free gifts and so don't despair  
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again  
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
She's so pretty but I'm so young  
When I'm sixteen I'm gonna have some fun  
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again  
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
All the little children of this great big world  
Are waitin' for the season's biggest thrill  
I wonder if I'll ever be able to get to sleep again  
'Cause the Christmas time thrill is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
Been tossin' and a-turnin' all through the night  
I'll be wide awake until broad daylight  
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas Eve is here again  
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
Old Saint Nick'll be stoppin' in  
To see the lady of the house again  
I wonder if he'll ever go and try to kiss Mommy on the cheek again  
'Cause the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again  
Ahh ahhh ahh  
  


I've been keepin' my eyes on you  
I finally found the nerve to talk to you  
There's something that you ought to know  
Don't you know that I love you so  
Our life together could be eternal bliss  
If we could just get close enough to kiss  
And ya' know I'd like to get a crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
You make me feel so warm inside  
A sense of humor you can't hide  
Who taught you darlin' how to move that way?  
And when you smile I know the world's okay  
And when I see the twinkle in your eye  
It sends my heart all the way to the sky  
And ya' know I'd like to get a crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Lonely nights, lonely days  
Lonely nights, lonely days  
I'm reachin' out for you  
In my mind, in my mind  
I'm goin' crazy  
Would ya' be my baby  
I'm gonna need a little help from above  
Would ya' say "no" if I asked for your love?  
I can't afford to get hurt again  
Like the time I remember when  
But I know I'd like to get a crack at your  
And ya know I'd like to get a crack at your  
Don't ya' know I'd like to get a crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love

Ocean lovers who like to harmonize  
They're all cousins friends and brothers  
And they make their Mamas cry  
They're record-making heart-breaking  
Just West Coast boys  
What I know it's a beginning of an endless harmony  
  
Striped shirt freedom  
Brave new worlds  
Go out on the road  
Where there's mid-sixties screaming  
And that nighttime holiday scheming  
While a lifestyle turns to gold  
Music's growing  
And vibrations showing  
What's it all mean  
I know it means there's an endless harmony  
  
And we sang God bless America  
It's a land where we tour  
She takes great care of us  
And people love for where we sing  
We sing...


Frosty the snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before i melt away"  
  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, "catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down  
The streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard them holler, "stop!"  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying, "don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day"


A Pisces lady loves romance (She loves romance)  
Her movements tell you at a glance (She loves to dance)  
Why they say Pisces rules the dance (She's got the glance)  
  
She values flowers more than gold (She flows like gold)  
Thinks of her men as knights of old (She's never bold)  
She's very spiritual I'm told (She has never told)  
Whoa  
  
But where's my spark in the dark?  
Glow glow glow see'mon glow  
The funky pretty flame in my heart  
Me and my Pisces lady are apart  
  
Her calendar is not like ours (She rules the hours)  
The hieroglyphs mark changing hours (She rules the stars)  
Her guiding light is from the stars (She's got the powers)  
Whoa  
A book of verse a jug of wine (She's soft like wine)  
She'll always tell what's on your mind (She's much like time)  
By just your birthday place and time (She's very fine)  
  
Cause it's a silent night in the sea  
And if you're cosmic'ly conscious you'll see  
Why she's a princess incarnate to me  
Daughter of Neptune the ruler of the sea  
  
The queen in Copenhagee (Funky pretty)  
The dream of Amsterdamee (Pretty funky)  
The cream of gay Parisee (Funky pretty)  
The theme of you Say Asee (Pretty funky)  
The scene in Great Britainyee (Funky pretty)  
The meaning in Los Angees (Pretty funky)  
The heat in Tokyosee (Funky pretty)  
The treat in Manhattohsee (Pretty funky)  
Yeah yeah funky pretty  
  
She said "Don't worry it's alright  
I'm coming back when the aspects are right"  
And now I look in the paper each day  
Wonderin' what my horoscope will say  
  
Funky (oooo funky)  
I still remember funky pretty (ooooo)  
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why  
(Why can't you tell me why)  
  
Funky (ooo funky) (something so why)  
I still remember funky pretty (something so why)  
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why  
(Why can't you tell me why)  
  
Funky (ooo funky) (something so why)  
I still remember funky pretty (something so why)  
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why  
(Why can't you tell me why)  
  
Funky (ooo funky) (something so why)  
I still remember funky pretty (something so why)  
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why  
(Why can't you tell me why)  
  
Funky (ooo funky) (something so why)  
I still remember funky pretty (something so why)  
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why

I still remember funky pretty (something so why)  
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why  
(Why can't you tell me why)


Ah ah ah ah oo ooo ooo oo ahh  
The girls on the beach  
  
On the beach you'll find them there  
In the sun and salty air  
The girls on the beach  
Are all within reach  
If you know what to do  
  
How we love to lie around  
Girls with tans of golden brown  
The girls on the beach  
Are all within reach  
And one waits there for you  
(Girls on the beach)  
  
The sun in her hair  
The warmth of the air  
On a summer day  
  
As the sun dips out of sight  
Couples on the beach at night  
The girls on the beach  
Are all within reach  
And with the boys tonight  
(Girls on the beach)  
  
Girls on the beach, girls on the beach  
Girls on the beach, girls on the beach


(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
  
They think I'm bad and I treat her so mean  
But all they know is from what they've seen  
And when I get her alone now  
You know we're happy as a couple could be  
And when I give her my love it's between her and me  
  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
And I know she's happy with me  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
  
Some guys may think they'd be better for her  
But she knows just what she wants for sure  
And when we're out with our friends now  
You know that we never have to put on a show  
And we stay together while other couples come and go  
  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
And I know she's happy with me  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
(good to my baby)  
  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby  
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby


I, I love the colorful clothes she wears  
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair  
I hear the sound of a gentle word  
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air  
  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations  
She's giving me excitations  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, good vibrations)  
She's giving me excitations(Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations(Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
  
Close my eyes  
She's somehow closer now  
Softly smile, I know she must be kind  
When I look in her eyes  
She goes with me to a blossom world  
  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations  
She's giving me excitations  
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, good vibrations)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
  
(Ah)  
(Ah my my what elation)  
I don't know where but she sends me there  
(Ah my, my, what a sensation)  
(Ah my, my, what elations)  
(Ah my, my, what)  
  
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations  
A happenin' with her  
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations  
A happenin' with her  
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations  
A happenin'

Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, I'm pickin' up good vibrations)  
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)  
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)  
She's na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na  
Do, do, do, do, do,  
Do, do, do

There's a time a for joy  
A time for tears  
A time we'll treasure through the years  
We'll remember always  
Graduation day  
  
At the senior prom  
We danced 'til three  
And there you gave your heart to me  
We'll remember always  
  
Graduation day  
Though we leave in sorrow  
All the joys we've known  
We can face tomorrow  
Knowing we'll never walk alone  
When the ivy walls  
  
Are far behind  
No matter where our paths may wind  
We'll remember always  
Graduation day  
We'll remember always  
Graduation day


Well, since she put me down  
I've been out doin' in my head  
I come in late at night  
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed  
  
Well, Rhonda, you look so fine (look so fine)  
And I know it wouldn't take much time  
For you to help me, Rhonda  
Help me get her out of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda, yeah  
Get her out of my heart  
  
She was gonna be my wife  
And I was gonna be her man  
(Oh Rhonda)  
But she let another guy come between us  
And it shattered our plans  
(Oh Rhonda)  
  
Well, Rhonda, you caught my eye (caught my eye)  
And I can give you lots of reasons why  
You gotta help me, Rhonda  
Help me get her out of my heart  
  
[Chorus x 2]


Here she comes  
Breathing life in to my thoughts  
There she goes  
Leaves a portrait in my soul  
Rolling in madness  
She does everything to me  
Wherever she goes you know the devil dances  
And the gods lay down in defeat  
  
Am I living  
Crazy woman can't you see  
That I'm giving  
Giving to you can you dig  
Me  
  
I want to live  
To learn the truth before my door  
Don't you know  
I'm a simple man for all I know  
This might be the hard way  
But it's easier for me  
To take all the changes that are always amazin'  
But to never let 'em fence me in  
  
Am I living  
Crazy woman can't you see  
That I'm giving  
Giving to you can you dig  
Me  
  
Me I'm only searchin' for the things I really need  
I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds  
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams  
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water  
And I can barely barely breathe  
Rolling down the road  
Rolling down the road  
Rolling down the road  
Rolling down the road  
Rolling down the road  
  
Listen listen  
Hear the music play  
Listen listen  
Hear the music play yeah  
Listen listen  
Hear the music play  
Listen listen  
Hear the music play  
  
Am I living  
Crazy woman can't you see  
That I'm giving  
Giving to you can you dig  
Me


It starts with just a little glance now  
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now  
You know you ought to take it slower  
But you just can't wait to get to know her  
  
A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing  
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring  
  
It makes you feel so bad  
It makes your heart feel sad  
It makes your days go wrong  
It makes your nights so long  
  
You've got to keep in mind love is here today  
And it's gone tomorrow  
It's here and gone so fast  
  
Right now you think that she's perfection  
This time is really an exception  
Well you know I hate to be a downer  
But I'm the guy she left before you found her  
  
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her  
But I keep on remembering things like they were  
  
She made me feel so bad  
She made my heart feel sad  
She made my days go wrong  
And made my nights so long  
  
You've got to keep in mind love is here today  
And it's gone tomorrow  
It's here and gone so fast  
  
Keep in mind love is here today  
And it's gone tomorrow  
It's here and gone so fast  
  
Love is here today  
And it's gone tomorrow  
It's here and gone so fast


Hey, little tomboy, sit here on my lap  
I got things that I gotta tell you  
No more skateboards, put away your baseball mitt.  
Your rough livin' days are through  
You could find places to go  
You could see that boys love you so  
They're doin' it all over the world

Look at all the changes I see

You're gonna feel just like this  
They're doin' it all over the world  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Time to turn into a girl

Oh we was dancing in a really big city  
Got excited by the sound of a party  
Now my heart beat while the music was groovin'  
And if you wanted to you couldn't keep from movin'  
Look around do you believe what you seein'  
The walls are movin' the ceiling's a-reelin'  
Couples over in the corner romancin'  
  
Oh the boys are with me to do some outta sight dancin'  
Gotta girl givin' me some lessons  
And now she's gonna be my confession  
Aren't you glad we found our way in here  
Put another record up on the player  
  
Hey there's a stoned party dancin' with the police  
Don't have to worry about disturbing the peace  
Met a fine chick that really got to me  
Good Lord how she boogalooed to me  
Oh my how she boogalooed it to me  
Come on sock it sock it to me

Ahhhhhh oooooo  
  
This is the way  
I always dreamed it would be  
The way that it is, oh oh  
When you are holding me  
I never had a love of my own  
Maybe that's why when we're all alone  
  
I can hear music  
I can hear music  
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever you're near  
  
Lovin' you  
It keeps me satisfied  
And I can't explain, oh no  
The way I'm feeling inside  
You look at me we kiss and then  
I close my eyes and here it comes again  
  
I can hear music  
I can hear music  
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby

The sound of the city baby seems to disappear  
I can hear music  
Sweet sweet music  
Whenever you touch me baby  
Whenever you're near


Well I've gone steady with a-lots of girls  
And to all of them I tried to be true  
But I'm so glad I never promised them  
What I promised you  
  
And that's I do (I do, yes I do)  
Take you (take you, I'll take you)  
For my wife (for my, for my wife)  
For the rest of my life (ah yes the rest of my life)  
  
Well I heard from my folks  
Time and time again  
To make sure that I found the right one  
And every time you meet  
Your heart will beat  
And you'll want to say  
  
You'll say I do (I do, yes I do)  
Take you (take you, I'll take you)

For my wife (for my, for my wife)  
For the rest of my life


When you say you do  
Makes me want to spend life with you  
I never knew life could be so good  
When you say you care  
Want to be right there beside you  
And show the world  
You've been good to me  
And you know I do  
  
All my love  
You are my love  
Without your love I go nowhere  
All my love

Want to be right there beside you  
And tell the world  
You've been good to me  
And you know I do  
  
All my love

Without your love I go nowhere

Five long days and I'm tired of working  
I'm going to see my boss today  
In fifteen minutes I'll be on the train  
'Cause I just got my pay  
Now I could take and sock away my dough  
And make me six percent a year  
But it's not much fun to wait around for that  
When I can spend it while it's here  
Ah  
Let's get dressed up  
And see a movie  
I like spending my money  
And I like having a good time  
Good times sure make me happy  
And I'm so happy  
'Cause I just got my pay  
Monday morning I'm up and at it  
Those last two days were good for my soul  
It's time to do my working thing  
I'm late so I got to roll  
My take home comes to 'bout ninety-five  
And my boss is giving me some praise  
If it weren't for me the place would fall apart  
I think I'll hit him up for a raise  
(Hit 'I'm up get a rais)  
Ah  
Let's get undressed  
And climb in bed too  
I like spending my money  
And I like having a good time  
Good times sure make me happy  
And I'm so happy  
'Cause I just got my pay  
Dada dada da  
Dadada  
Da da da da da  
Dadada  


(Just groovy.)  
(Beatle?)  
(What is it, what is it?)  
(No--hey, faster.)  
(It's Paul. Paul is the [...].)  
([...])  
(Who?)  
(Paul!)  
  
I should have known better with a girl like you  
That I would love everything that you do  
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do  
  
(Faster!)  
Woah-oh I should have realized what a kiss could be  
That this could only happen to me  
Can't you see, can't you see...  
  
That when I tell you that I love you, oh  
You're gonna say you love me too, oo oo oo oo  
Bow bow bow  
And when I ask you to be mi-i-i-ine  
You're gonna say you love me too  
You love me too  
(Harmonics!)  
You love me too  
You love me too  
  
(Great. Now, "Tell Me Why." How does that go? That's my favorite Beatles
song.)  
(One more time. Tell me why.)  
(Who knows.)  
(Hey, 7Up! I want some 7Up.)  
(Hey, I got some.)  
(Over here, I want some ice cubes!)


[Hello I'm the Pied Piper from the far away land of Night]  
[Nobody knows anything about my existence]  
[I only want to know kids]  
[Late at night when people are sleeping]  
[I go into their old radios and turn them into magic transistors]  
[And fly outside with them]  
[I come from such a far away land of Night]  
[That I'm fascinated with the funny music I hear on your radios]  
[You are the first to know of me]  
[You can't see me I'm hidden]  
[But you can see the green glow I make]  
[I heard you laugh last night]  
[I figured that you would be amused by me]  
[Listen to this]  
  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
Then the prince heard something he never knew could be  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
When the music died down the Piper said that "every night  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
I'll promise to bring more magic music to you  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
No one" he said " will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
You are my only friend of night" said the Pied Piper "and I'll talk to  
You again some night"  
  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
Then the radio was glowing no more  
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince  
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed  
  
That night he dreamt all night  
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper  
  
The prince did try what the Piper said to do  
But for weeks at night  
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night  
  
"That Pied Piper must have been joking" he said  
"There's nothing but Bach on this radio  
I'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good"  
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud  
That two of his brothers overheard him  
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned  
It on  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
There it was the music had to be from the Pied Piper himself  
  
(My radio is radiatin' through the)  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
(Through the misty night)  
(Through the misty night)  
  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
(My radio is radiatin' through the)  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
(Through the misty night)  
(Through the misty night)  
  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
The prince's sisters ran in their brother's room  
(My radio is radiatin' through the)  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
And they were all dancing and screaming with joy  
(Through the misty night)  
(Through the misty night)  
But the transistor was playing too loud  
  
And their mother heard it  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
"What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?  
Give me that radio at once" she said


I came along when he broke your heart  
That's when you needed someone  
To help forget about him  
  
I gave you love with a brand new start  
That's what you needed the most  
To set your broken heart free  
  
I know you cried, and you felt blue  
But when I could I gave strength to you  
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again  
  
I kissed your lips  
And when your face looked sad  
It made me think about him  
And that you still loved him so  
  
But you know that pretty soon  
I made you feel glad  
That you belonged to me  
And love began to show  
  
He hurt you then, but that's all gone  
I guess I'm saying you're the only one  
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again  
  
He hurt you then, but that's all done  
I guess I'm saying you're the only one  
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again  
  
You didn't think that I could sit around and let him work  
You didn't think that I could sit around and let (watch) him take you  
You didn't think that I could sit around and let him go  
You didn't think that I could sit back and let you go  
You didn't think...

Horses of gas and steel  
The highway is my home

Blazing trails both near and far  
Park my car behind a star  
Life is full of possibilities

In my car

Please don't let me argue anymore  
I won't make you worry like before  
Can't remember what we fought about  
Late late last night we said it was over  
But i remember when we thought it out  
We both had a broken heart  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
As i drove away i felt a tear  
It hit me i was losing someone dear  
Told my folks i would be alright  
Tossed and i turned, my head was so heavy  
Then i wondered as it got light  
Were you still awake like me?  
Woah baby

I love to see you oh my love  
I want to feel you near  
My need is deep inside  
Well I've been rolling on,  
I've been holding on,  
I'd like you to know  
That it's been a long, long time  
Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day  
Sometimes it's hard to find my way  
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days  
When your friends have all gone  
Leaving this town for another one  
The night is coming round  
I can feel the weight of coming down,  
So afraid to lose this dream  
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can  
It's so easy to lose my way  
Lay your head where you may find some peace  
I've been searching for my happiness  
Don't you want to wake up and take my love,  
I'd be happy if you'd let me know  
Should I stay or go  
Let me know  
Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me,  
Of new realities,  
Heavenly angels won't you guide me  
Please help me to decide the path most  
Meant for me.  
  


Let the wind blow  
Let the grass grow  
But don't let her go  
  
Don't take her out of my life  
Don't take her out of my life  
  
Let the moon glow  
(Let the moon glow)  
(On the fallen snow)  
On the fallen snow  
(Let the moon glow)  
(On the fallen snow)  
  
But I just got to know  
(Let me please know oh oh oh)  
Know she'll be a part of my life  
Know she'll be a part of my life  
Forever  
  
Let the bees make honey  
Let the poor find money  
Take away their sorrows  
Give them sunshine tomorrow  
  
But don't take her out of my life  
Don't take her out of my life  
What would I do without her tell me now  
  
Let the bird sing  
With the coming spring  
Let the church bells ring  
Let the rain fall  
Let the grass grow  
Let the moon glow  
On the fallen snow  
  
But don't take her out of my life  
Please keep her a part of my life

He sat up in his open window  
Looking quietly down at the path  
A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again  
  
Down jumped the prince  
And he went again to find his radio  
  
(Magic transistor radio)  
(Glowing magic transistor radio)  
(Glowing magic transistor radio)  
As he made his way he could hear something once again  
(Glowing magic transistor radio)  
There was that transistor up on the same tree  
  
Then from inside of it came a strange voice


Make it big  
So big  
  
You can make it big  
You can make it bigger than life  
See your name spelled right  
Up on the bright lights  
Bright lights  
  
Have a little faith in yourself  
In everything that you do  
I know you're gonna make it big if you want to  
If you really want to  
You can make it big

Sees something looking hot and sweet  
Hey, baby would you like to meet me tonight?

Lots of girls running through my brain tonight

My baby she told me  
She don't want to hold me (oh, no!)  
And kiss my lips anymore  
She's gonna leave me  
And she don't believe me  
That I'll be true now  
  
Well maybe she don't love me  
And is not thinkin' of me  
But why'd she do it this time of year?  
She knows that I'll miss her  
And I'll want to kiss her  
If just for Christmas  
  
[Chorus]  
Merry Christmas, baby  
Merry Christmas, baby  
Merry Christmas, baby  
  
Tell me, what did I do  
To really convince you  
That I'm not the guy anymore?  
Take back my ring now  
I'll do anything now  
But please forgive me  
  
I made my mistake but  
I'm willing to wake up  
And never mess around anymore  
Oh why did we break up?  
There's still time to make up  
If just for Christmas  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I made my mistake but  
I'm willing to wake up  
And never mess around anymore  
Oh why did we break up?  
There's still time to make up  
If just for Christmas  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Merry Christmas, baby

I was working in the lab, late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
If you've ever seen a monster before  
Dancin' across the dance floor  
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout  
Turn around and help the monster turn it out  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
And if you don't have core hard cash  
You can still do the monster mash  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said  
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash  
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash  
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Mash  


Well, if your hands start a-clappin'  
And your fingers start a-poppin'  
And your feet start a-movin' around  
And if you start to swing and sway  
  
When the band starts to play  
A real cool way out sound  
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down  
You feel like you gotta move around  
  
You get a shot of rhythm and blues.  
With just a little rock and roll on the side  
Just for good measure.  
Get a pair of dancin' shoes  
  
Well, with your lover by your side  
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon!  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
  
And chills come up on you  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well, here's something for you to do  
  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
With just a little rock and roll on the side  
Just for good measure  
Get a pair of dancin' shoes  
  
Well, with your lover by your side  
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon!  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
  
And chills come up on you  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well, here's something for you to do  
  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
Get a pair of dancin' shoes  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
Well, with your lover by your side  
  
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon!  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
And chills come up on you  
  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well, here's something for you to do  
Well, here's something for you to do  
Well, here's something for you to do


Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy  
Are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Images of broken light, which  
Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Sounds of laughter, shades of life  
Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva, om.  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva

That's all I do  
And if you saw my love  
You'd love her to  
I love her  
  
She gives my everything  
And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
And I love her  
  
A love like ours  
Could never die  
As long as I  
Have you near me  
  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her  
  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her, ooh


You tell me that you've got everything you want  
And your bird can sing  
But you don't get me  
You don't get me  
  
You say you've seen the seven wonders  
And you bird is green  
But you can't see me  
You can't see me  
  
When your prized possessions  
Start to weigh you down  
Look in my direction  
I'll be round, I'll be round  
  
When your bird is broken  
Will it bring you down  
You may be awoken  
I'll be round, I'll be round  
  
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is  
And your bird can swing  
But you can't hear me  
You can't hear me


For I have got another girl, another girl  
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you  
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new  
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want  
  
For I have got another girl, another girl  
She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few  
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do  
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop  
  
For I have got another girl  
Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend  
  
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you  
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new  
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want  
  
For I have got another girl  
Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend  
  
For I have got another girl  
Another girl who will love me till the end  
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend  
For I have got another girl


Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all, all  
You've gotta do is call and I'll be there.  
If you need somebody to love, just look into my eyes, I'll  
Be there to make you feel right.  
If you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really sympathize.  
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight.  
Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all , all  
You've gotta do is call and I'll be there.  
If the sun has faded away, I'll try to make it shine,  
There's nothing I won't do  
If you need a shoulder to cry on I hope it will be mine.  
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you.  
Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all , all  
You've gotta do is call and I'll be there.  
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there.


I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.  
And it's true that it really only goes to show,  
That I know,  
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.  
  
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry.  
And in time, you'll understand the reason why,  
If I cry,  
It's not because I'm sad, but you're the only love that I've ever had.  
  
I can't believe it's happened to me  
I can't conceive of any more misery.  
  
Ask me why, I'll say I love you,  
And I'm always thinking of you.

Far as the eye can see

Well come into my machine  
So we can move on out

Where we can jump and shout  
It's not too far back on the highway  
Not too long a ride  
You take your car along  
And you park it outside  
A little cutie takes your hat  
And you can thank her, ma'am  
'Cause every time you're gonna drive  
You find the joint is jammed

While the music will treat you  
When they get a crowd  
Well you can dance

Your day breaks, your mind aches  
You find that all the words of kindness linger on  
When she no longer needs you  
  
She wakes up, she makes up  
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry  
She no longer needs you  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years!  
  
You want her, you need her  
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead  
You think she needs you  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years!  
  
You stay home, she goes out  
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone  
She doesn't need him  
  
Your day breaks, your mind aches  
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head  
You won't forget her  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years!

Help! Not just anybody,  
Help! You know I need someone, help.  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today,  
I never needed anybody's help in any way.  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured,

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around.  
Help me get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me?

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around.  
Help me get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me?

The world is treating me bad...Misery.  
I'm the kind of guy,  
Who never used to cry,  
The world is treatin' me bad...Misery!  
  
I've lost her now for sure,  
I won't see her no more,  
It's gonna be a drag...Misery!  
  
I'll remember all the little things we've done  
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one.  
  
Send her back to me,  
'Cause everyone can see  
Without her I will be in misery  
  
I'll remember all the little things we've done.

'Cause everyone can see,

In misery (ooh ee ooh ooh)  
My misery (la la la la la la)


As I was slowly passing  
An orphan's home one day,  
I stopped for just a little while  
To watch the children play.  
Alone a boy was standing  
And when I asked him why,  
He turned with eyes that could not see  
And he began to cry.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.  
  
No mummy's arms to hold me  
Or sue me when I cry,  
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome  
I wish that I could die.  
I'll walk the streets of heaven  
Where all blinds can see.  
  
And just like for the other kids  
It will be a home for me.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.


The part of love that I'm scared of  
is the actual taking off  
I can take a bumpy landing  
But the start must be soft  
soft, soft, soft  
It must be soft  
  
Some men need your attention  
every minute, every hour  
Some women need the proof  
in every chocolate, every flower  
Are you asking me down your runway?  
I'm asking you to be watchtower  
tower, tower, tower  
to be watchtower  
tower, tower, tower  
  
  
Some men just like the journey  
don't care if it's incomplete  
Some women like a long trip  
Some women short 'n' sweet  
But if we lift each other up  
Let's make it 10,000 feet  
feet, feet, feet  
10,000 feet  
feet, feet, feet  
  
  
The reason I'm still down here  
and I've never taken off  
Is I never had the courage  
To rummage through love's loft  
loft, loft, loft  
The highest loft  
loft, loft, loft  
  
  
Cos when we're finally up there  
and the engines have been stopped  
the landing won't be fatal  
if love's parachute's been dropped  
dropped, dropped, dropped  
love's been dropped  
dropped, dropped, dropp  


I want expensive not cheap  
And all the secrets that you keep  
Should be quietly put to sleep  
Not then not when not yet this week  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
But this time he is surprised  
Cut the alibis from my eyes  
From my eyes  
Eyes  
  
One sample of your wit  
You ask me round to baby-sit  
Just sat there smiling from a pit  
Is the goddess of the vimly lit  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
But this time he is surprised  
Cut the alibis from my eyes  
From my eyes  
From my eyes  
  
I want you pretty not polite  
And all those compliments you invite  
They should burn by candlelight  
Not tomorrow next week but just tonight  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
But this time he is surprised  
You cut the alibis from my eyes  
From my eyes  
From my eyes  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
I have told a thousand lies  
From my eyes  
I have told a thousand lies  
This time he is surprised  
I have told a thousand lies  
I have told a thousand lies


You've heard it said a thousand times  
But only heard his Broadway lines  
So, baby please go  
Ain't, ain't part of the show  
  
'Cause when Romeo needs no cue or prompt  
The likelier your little heart be stomped  
By, by baby don't go  
Written, written in to his show  
  
'Cause in the west-end show your life  
Played understudy to every part  
Got given all the dullest lines  
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart  
  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
  
The sorry tale we'd all applaud  
That only dripped and never poured  
But, baby just go  
Let him, let him on with his show  
  
The leading snail leaves tell tale lines  
The bullshit tower the loudest chimes  
But, baby please go  
Ain't, ain't part of the show  
  
'Cause in the west-end show your life  
Played understudy to every part  
Got given all the dullest lines  
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart  
  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
  
Romantic love lines that we adored (Baby forget them)  
They were read by men from idiot board (Baby forget them)  
So a message from the wisest guy to broad  
Is best like flattery ignored  
  
Baby just let him go  
Let him on with the show  
Baby just let him go  
Let him on with the show  


My pod is bigger than your pod  
My life is bigger than your life  
My mouth is bigger than your mouth  
Your age is bigger than my age  
Your height, my height  
Your weight, my weight  
  
My love is bigger than your love  
Your fist is bigger than mine  
My son is bigger than your son  
Your sun it doesn't shine, doesn't shine  
Doesn't shine, doesn't shine  
At all  
  
My big is bigger than your big  
My small is smaller than your small


Big coin that you toss for heads or tails  
Big coin that you let slip down the drain  
Big coin didn't find where it landed  
Big coin, big coin  
  
Big coin that you dropped in the river  
Little raft that took you across  
Little hand that pulled it from the gutter  
Big coin, big coin  
  
It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin  
But the coin has no beat or no breath  
Big coin won't even leave you a love note  
Big coin, big death  
  
Big coin that you held and you treasured  
Big coin that you can't believe that you lost  
Little kiss that helped you when you needed  
Little kiss, big coin  
  
Little heart that has no exchange rate  
Big coin that could join the IMF  
Little heart is only the greedy 'cause it's poor  
Little heart, big coin  
  
It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin  
But the coin has no north or no south  
Big coin says it will never ever leave you  
Big coin, big mouth  
  
Little heart,  
it ain't gold, it ain't silver  
Little heart,  
it ain't wasted on me  
Little heart,  
so much bigger than the coin  
Little heart,  
big guarantee  
Little heart,  
big guarantee  
  
Little heart...  
  
It's a tiny little heart that challenges the coin  
But the coin has no north or no south  
Big coin says it will never ever leave you  
Big coin, big mouth


Eyes to take you dancing  
Mouth to leave your wife  
Legs to run away with  
And you wonder why?  
  
Heart that makes you bypass  
Every other girl  
Smile that keeps you grinning  
At the madness of this world  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below  
  
Front to make you happy  
Back to make you weep  
Lips to keep you kissing  
Whilst everyone's asleep  
  
Tears to break a backbone  
Laughs to win a war  
And people come and ask me  
What I love you for  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below  
  
And with a tongue built from quicksilver  
And a character of steel  
They actually come and ask me  
How I feel  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below

They're forming in straight line  
They're going through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
They're piling in the back seat  
They're generating steam heat  
Pulsating to the back beat  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
Hey ho, let's go  
Shoot 'em in the back now  
What they want, I don't know  
They're all reved up and ready to go  
They're forming in a straight line  
They're going through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
They're piling in the back seat  
They're generating steam heat  
Pulsating to the back beat  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
Hey ho, let's go  
Shoot 'em in the back now  
What they want, I don't know  
They're all reved up and ready to go  
  
They're forming in a straight line

When you say goodbye I really want to know  
Everything you do and everyplace you go  
And did you take a regular supply  
Of those crazy little tampax with you  
It hurts me deep inside, it hurts me outside too  
I feel a little pardon and I feel a little used  
If you ever needed someone to polish up your shoes  
I'll be waiting, with my brush  
  
I'd move to Italy with you if I had the money  
But 'til then I'll sit at home and read maps and go to pub  
Where the weather isn't sunny and the weather isn't bad  
Where the bellies look so happy but the faces look so sad  
But it doesn't really matter what's outside  
'Cause I'm in here and he's in here  
And she's in here and they're in here  
We're all in here, we're all so glad  
  
And in our own funny way we're all in Italy anyway  
Eating fancy pasta, climbing mountain ranges  
Drinking ice-cold lagers, living in Spanish castles  
We're all with you, in our thoughts  
In white ankle socks and pink Bermuda shorts  
I'll be with you, with you one day, we'll all be with you, with you one day  
One sunny beach, one sunny life, we're all glad for you  
But 'til then, we're all glad for you, I'm so glad  
  
I am a man, and I have a tent, I have a ball and a bat  
I have a li-lo, I have a bucket  
I have a good, good, good pair of trunks  
I've got a good, good pair of trunks  
  
Well here I am at the airport, with my passport  
I have a brain but only just, and we're all glad  
We're all so glad, I'm so glad, she's so glad, he's so glad  
You know how glad I am?


Well I always knew you'd take the crutches  
And not the skis  
1 always knew you'd take the stilts  
And then your knees  
When God gave you the sky  
I knew you'd take the trees  
Son you've grown those chicken wings  
You just can't fly  
  
They anchored our dream yacht to ocean bed  
Chained our ideal home to bicycle shed  
Clamped our racing car before we sat in driver's seat  
Tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree  
  
We could've courted Einstein  
Could've courted Marx  
We could've gone for strolls  
Like other families do in parks  
Son you were born a dud  
In a family without sparks  
Yes you've got those chicken wings  
You just can't fly  
  
The checkered flag  
That losers despise  
Never flew in our port  
Or harbored in our eyes  
Cause we always formed that queue  
For second prize  
This family's got those chicken wings  
We just can't fly  
  
Our winning tickets ripped up into shreds  
The tale of this family, is its heads  
We're bouncing on a pogo stick  
Without any springs  
It hurts me to admit this  
But we've got those chicken wings  
  
Yes you've got those chicken wings  
And all the luggage that the failure brings  
Is a swallow flying high that sings  
Look he's got those chicken wings  
He may as well die


I've been so happy since I walked away  
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today  
'Cause you were nothing but a big mistake  
And life is wonderful, now that I'm rid of you  
  
Oh I must have been crazy to have stayed with you  
I can't believe I thought I was in love with you  
But now the scales have fallen I can really see  
And I say go to hell, 'cause that's where you took me  
  
Well, I've felt better since I slammed that door  
You always cramped my style, I never noticed before  
It's been a non-stop party since I flew the coop  
I can't believe I fell for such a loser like you  
  
And is it any wonder that I felt so blue  
When I was always having to put up with you  
  
Oh, here we go again, just lay the blame on me  
Don't say another word, 'cause sweetheart, you're history  
  
I know that you miss me really, bet you wish that you still had me  
You'll never find someone like me but I've got no regrets at all  
  
Because I've met this girl and she's so good to me  
She's really beautiful, fantastic company  
And, when I'm with her I realise what love can be  
Because she's fifty times the person you'll ever be  
  
Good luck, mister, do you think I care?  
Since you've been gone the offers have been everywhere  
I've got a million guys just lining up for me  
I've turned a corner, boy, my life is ecstasy  
  
Well, I've been in heaven since I walked away  
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today  
'Cause you were nothing but a waste of space  
And life is wonderful now that I'm over you  
Over you  
Over you


Through ugly pints and Sunday breath  
Sit men whose stare is cold as death  
Through wide lapels and glued up eyes  
Through made up kids and made up wives  
Sitting in the heart of them  
Is a man who's not like other men  
Don't you know just who I am  
A nod, a wink, I am the domino man.  
  
And if you pull a double one  
I'll pack my bags and I'll be gone  
If you pull a three and four  
I'm flying off to Singapore  
Where women dance and tigers roar  
I'm lying on a distant shore  
I'm living life just as as I can  
A nod, a wink, another drink I am the domino man.  
  
Through a twenty deep screen of humorists  
Through slavering jaws and angry fists  
Through tales of mishap and the clickety-clack  
Is fully paid member of the brother of the tap  
  
Through heavy smoke and idle bets  
Through heaving lungs and heavy debts  
Sits a man who knows he can  
A nod, a wink, I am the domino man  
  
And if you pull a two and a six  
I'll pack my bags and take that risk  
And if you pull a four and five  
They'll never take this man alive  
I'll go far east and I'll survive  
The market streets I'll duck and dive  
I'm living life as fast as I can  
A nod, a wink, another drink I am the domino man  
  
And when he's off to sail the seven seas  
He just stay indoors or hides up trees  
He's been to places that you've never seen  
But his mind is blank and his passport's clean  
  
But if you pull a two and a six  
I'll pack my bags and take that risk  
And if you pull a four and five  
They'll never take this man alive  
I'll go far east and I'll survive  
The market street I'll duck and dive  
I'm living life just as fast as I can  
A nod, a wink, another drink, I am the domino man


Everybody's talking at me  
I don't hear a word they're saying  
Only the echoes of my mind  
  
People stopping staring  
I can't see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
  
I'm going where the sun keeps shining  
Through' the pouring rain  
Going where the weather suits my clothes  
Backing off of the North East wind  
Sailing on summer breeze  
And skipping over the ocean like a stone  
  
I'm going where the sun keeps shining  
Through' the pouring rain  
Going where the weather suits my clothes  
Backing off of the North East wind  
Sailing on summer breeze  
And skipping over the ocean like a stone


I was about to write a song about the fear and the doubt  
But my pen ran out  
It captured the emotions of a lover and a lout  
But my pen ran out  
So the picture wasn't painted and the story wasn't told  
No one knows the author 'cause the record never sold  
And I know they never will until he's bitter and he's old  
His time ran out  
  
I was gonna share my blues with a nation full of blues  
But my pen ran out  
I was gonna spread the news of the way I always lose  
But my pen ran out  
So I'll keep an envelope with all the words I should have said  
Hide it in a tiny box underneath my bed  
And written on the outside will be 'open when he's dead'  
And written on the outside will be 'open when he's dead'  
  
His time ran out, his time ran out  
His time ran out, his time ran out


I was handed down the looks of a man with a broken nose  
That's the way our family was I suppose  
But at least you gave me deeply profound  
As we lay and chatted late upon the cricket ground  
You didn't have to love me  
Where others got rid  
You didn't have to treat me like a very good friend  
But I'm glad that you did  
One thing I never said to you  
And one thing I never can  
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers  
I'm your No. 1 fan  
I'm your No. 1 fan  
I'm the richly blessed daughter of a mother with tattooed arms  
That's the way my family life, life was charmed  
But at least it gave me mental grace  
And a thought at the pit on my mind and a smile on my face  
You didn't have to listen  
To a word that I'd said  
You didn't have to tell me all those silly old jokes  
For every tear that I shed  
Every tear that I shed  
'cause one thing I never said to you  
And one thing I never can  
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers  
I'm your No. 1 fan  
I'm your No. 1 fan  
I was handed down a bike with a crooked old wheel  
But I rode it on a million lanes the way that you made me feel  
But at least we thought about it so long. and hard  
As we sat upon our mother in the graveyard  
And you don't have to listen  
To a word in this song  
Your picture hangs the same and in the same old place  
Even though that you've gone  
Even though that you've gone  
Cos. one thing I never said to you  
And one thing I never can  
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers  
I'm your No. 1 fan  
I'm your No. 1 fan  
Yes I am  
I'm your No. 1 fan


Don't whisper love and dream of wedding bells  
Don't do all the talking, let love speak up itself  
Let love speak up itself  
  
So when you feel a little tatty and unhappy with your face  
Let it breathe into us and put you back in place  
Let it breathe, let it breathe  
From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave  
For it will, it will go  
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello  
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass  
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass  
'To the world's greatest mum  
From the oldest swinger in town'  
  
Let love speak up itself  
Let love speak up itself  
Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk  
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk  
When we're too tired to talk  
  
And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was  
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off  
Let it rot, let it rot  
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot  
In a knot, in a knot  
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot  
Hang them from a cleaver and say 'Look what we've got  
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot'  
'To the world's greatest mum  
From the oldest swinger in town'  
  
Let love speak up itself


Love wars, love wars  
Love wars, love wars  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
But it's taking me under  
Since you're not here  
  
Its better when it's hard to get  
But this hide and go seek  
Well, it's making me weep  
  
I promise to stop boxing you 'round  
So don't scratch my face  
End of round eight  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
  
The talks we had don't change a thing  
They only bring rain  
On top of pain  
  
Flash back and uncover tracks  
From when you left  
With my best friend  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Make love in peace  
And then never ever cheat  
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on  
  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't want)  
Love wars  
  
Love bombs explodin' in air  
Until the last one  
I really don't care  
  
I remember losing my head  
And calling you things  
Like dirty names  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Make love in peace  
And then never ever cheat  
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on  
  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't want)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we can't start)  
Love wars  
Love wars (we don't need)  
Love wars


(T. Jans)  
Originally performed by Etta James  
  
If you could hear me now  
The one who said that  
She'd rather roam  
The one who said  
She'd rather be alone  
If you could only hear me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment I could really make you mine  
Just for a while turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
Cause I've been too long  
In the wind  
And too long in the rain  
Taking any comfort that I can  
  
Looking back and hoping for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
  
If you could see me now  
Singing somewhere through the lonely night  
And dreaming of the love that held me tight  
If you could only see me now  
  
Cause I've been too long in the wind  
And too long in the rain  
Taking any comfort that I can  
  
Looking back and hoping for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
  
I can almost feel your loving arms again  
I can almost feel your loving arms again


That grand facade  
Will finally diminish  
When he breaks your heart  
From start to finish  
  
Sisters dream of isles in paradise  
That ain't no use when the captain's just capsized  
The smile that you now know was a guise  
Left his clever lips and stole the prize  
  
So women take a loser's good advice  
Let your hem go floating out but use the anchor twice  
Don't feel ever sorry for the dicks  
Just grab the dice and hope you roll a six, a six

So as nature gave out semen  
To the jealous and the sick  
Jesus gave out candies  
To the dim or partially lit  
  
And woman you're a lighthouse  
While the candle only drips  
Girl you are a shining star  
In masculine eclipse  
  
In masculine eclipse  
In masculine eclipse  
In masculine eclipse

They could be fat or could be thin  
They could be black, they could be white  
Tell me who's knocking at the knocking shop door tonight  
  
Not much a girl can do but open or close  
Those things are above doors  
Not much legs can do but open or close  
Those things are above us whores  
  
So imagine a mirror  
Bigger than the room it was placed in  
Imagine my wish for a future that cannot hold my wish  
Imagine the want to hold a rod that cannot hold the fish  
Imagine a rod that cannot hold the fish  
  
They could be lonely or could be bust  
They could be tack, they could be real  
They do have feelings, but just right now I feel  
  
A feminine receptacle, that's just what I am  
Those things are above us whores  
Just the best target practice, for a misguided man  
Those things are above us whores  
  
So imagine a mirror  
Bigger than the room it was placed in  
Imagine my wish for a future that cannot hold my wish  
Imagine the want to hold a rod that cannot hold the fish  
Imagine a rod that cannot hold the fish


This is my life and this is how it reads  
For every chapter, a thousand memories  
A murder, a mystery where everybody bleeds  
A fantasy, a thriller with romance and disease  
  
Diary entry 9th of May '62  
We've had some ugly babies but none were quite like you  
Diary entry '62 end of May  
It looks as if the nose and chin are definitely here to stay  
They're here to stay, they're here to stay  
  
If my lips start smiling and my knees start a-knocking  
I'm a failure  
You are, you are  
And if I seem half-hearted, it's because I'm broken hearted  
And I'm a failure  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
  
This is my life and this is how it reads  
A documentary that nobody believes  
Albert Steptoe in 'Gone with the Breeze'  
Mother played by Peter Beardsley, father by John Cleese  
  
Diary entry '68 end of the year  
A cardboard Apollo Six has given the all clear  
11th December '68 Captain's log  
Proposed trip to Mars is cancelled due to fog  
It's due to fog, it's due to fog  
  
If my lips start smiling and my knees start a-knocking  
I'm a failure  
You are, you are  
And if I seem half-hearted, it's because I'm broken hearted  
And I'm a failure  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
  
This is the play, it was I who wrote the script  
Terry meets June in 'Tales from the Crypt'  
It was going to be a film but the camera person slipped  
They later found him scolding a banana  
  
Diary entry tenth of April '89  
The world is going mad but me I'm doing fine  
I'm doing fine  
  
Back to bed, back to reality  
Just fine.


You request pollard and you get pollard  
You ask for pollard and you get pollard  
You plead for pollard and you get pollard  
You get down for pollard and you get pollard  
You get down for pollard and you get pollard  
You get down on your knees for pollard  
And you get pollard  
You get down on your knees and you get pollard  
  
Cos you request pollard when you get pollard  
And you ask for pollard and you get pollard  
You plead for pollard and you get pollard  
You get down for pollard and you get pollard  
You get down for pollard and you get pollard  
You get down on your knees for pollard  
You get down on your knees for pollard  
And you get pollard


'I fought hard in the Second World War'  
You hear them shout  
No good bragging about the Afrika Korps  
It was Beadle's About  
  
They dressed you up and took you off to World War One  
Armed you and surrounded you with wire  
Sat in stinking mud you sung your stupid songs  
And waited till they told you when to fire  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
Nothing makes them laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
From the First World War to the Yom-Kippur  
It was Beadle's About  
The bayonets slice, the rockets roar  
And he jumps out  
  
Fond memories of the bloody bridge you failed to hold  
Many of your buddies killed or maimed  
You would've shot at rabbits if that's what you'd been told  
Till the General said 'I'm sorry you've been framed'  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
And nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Keep those entries coming  
Leave those cameras running  
Keep those entrails coming  
Leave those soldiers gunning  
Because you're sure to get a laugh  
With a video bloodbath  
Nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Here's a wacky video we got last week  
A bomb catches Arthur unawares  
He's lost both his arms and he can't see or speak  
But thank you for the memory you shared  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
And nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Keep those entries coming  
Leave those cameras running  
Keep those entrails coming  
Leave those soldiers gunning  
Because you're sure to get a laugh  
With a video bloodbath  
Nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath


Is it Cologne with it's great cathedral? Milan with it's glamour and it's
pace? London with it's river and it's bridges? Lisbon with it's beauty and
it's grace? Funny looking buses Climb it's pot-bellied hills And a solitary
jogger Times the time he kills Do you know where I'm gonna go? None of you
have guessed, so none of you can know If you've been, that's not where I mean
It's got class and it's got excellence like you've never seen Your town is
dragging me down Dragging me down, down, down Your town is dragging me down
Dragging me down, down, down Is it Dublin with it's culture and it's wit?
Madrid with it's market square? Paris with it's bustling cafes? Hull with it's
musical flair? Do you know where I'm gonna go? None of you have guessed so
none of you can know If you've been, that's not where I mean It's got class
and it's got excellence like you've never seen Your town is dragging me down
Is dragging me down, down, down Your town is dragging me down Is dragging me
down, down, down As I watch them drop the grain into your fish tank brain How
can you like this place when it never even rains? Never even rains Your town
is dragging me down Is dragging me down, down, down Your town is dragging me
down Is dragging me down, down, down Is dragging me down, down, down Is
dragging me down, down, down Is dragging me down, down, down


And the women tug their hair  
Like they're trying to prove it won't fall out  
And all the men are gargoyles  
Dipped long in Irish stout  
  
The whole place is pickled  
The people are pickles for sure  
And no-one knows if they've done more here  
Than they ever would do in a jar  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone  
Anywhere alone  
  
And everyone is blonde  
And everyone is beautiful  
And when blondes and beautiful are multiple  
They become so dull and dutiful  
  
And when faced with dull and dutiful  
They fire red warning flares  
Battle-Khaki personality  
With red underwear  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone  
Anywhere alone  
  
The whole place is pickled  
The people are pickles for sure  
And no-one knows if they've done more here  
Than they ever would do in a jar  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone


Do not think of me alive do not think of me as dead  
Get that thought right out of your head  
Fifty times you told me so to satisfy  
I must grow but all you did was pull or blow  
  
If size isn't everything and I'm half his size  
How come it's him who gets to keep the prize  
But you fuck long and you fuck slow  
But you fuck like a walrus smoking blow  
I'm too ashamed to scream your name  
Well I don't feel hard and I don't feel lame  
Never proud and never ashamed  
But this bed's too big for the both of us  
  
If size isn't everything well I'll slap my thighs  
But there won't be parting and there won't be cries  
If size isn't everything then try this size  
Turn off the lights and bring a torch  
  
Oh my heart's in the right place  
My heart's in the right place  
My heart's in the right place  
My heart's in the right place  
And my heart's twice the size of his arse  
  
So if size isn't everything then try this size  
Turn off the lights and bring a torch  
And if size isn't everything and I'm half his size  
How come it's him who gets to keep the prize  
How come it's him who gets to keep the prize  
  
How come it's him who gets to keep the prize


Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Tell me all about the way you make me feel  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Tell me all the things I want to know  
And tell me all the places that you go  
  
Tell me all the nothings in your life  
Mix them with the somethings in your life  
But speak to me  
Yeah, speak to me  
  
?My name is Joy Friend.  
I'm thirty and I was born on the thirtieth of the second sixty.  
I work as an accountant and my dream job would be to be a pilot.  
This morning for breakfast I had half a grapefruit.  
My favourite part of myself is my eyes.  
My least favourite part of myself is, sometimes when alone,  
Perhaps late at night I like to read a dirty book.  
I watch Prisoner Cell Block H.  
My favourite animal?  
  
Speak to me  
Tell me all the things you really feel  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Speak to me


Why don't you sing 'I need you baby'?  
'Cause it rhymes with crazy and it rhymes with maybe  
It rhymes with lady and much much more  
And it doesn't rhyme with the 'f' word  
  
Well Simon le Bon stayed round my house before  
And he was sick on the plants and he was sick on the floor  
And he wouldn't go home until he'd sung his song  
With a backing harmony from Paul Young  
  
Shell we dance again?  
In our special way  
With our trousers round  
our knees  
  
Why don't your video have dancing girls?  
With hips that curve and lips that curl  
Legs are where the heartbeat starts  
It's low in neckline and high in charts  
  
But it's the partially clothed for the partially sighted  
Behind over matter keeps the crowds delighted  
We want Rambo in a ra-ra skirt  
Nastassia Kinski in a Brazilian shirt


Sadness has filled a lonely place  
Before that there was just a hole  
At least now there's sadness on my face  
My lower lip has finally found it's role  
  
So the wind and the rain and the snow  
Had no particular place to go  
So they thought they'd come and spend some time with me  
They're better friends than you could ever be  
  
There's a tattoo, a small tattoo  
Waiting there unpaid for you  
And if you ever bump into Unlucky  
Don't forget who broke your heart in two  
You better get there early, there's a million in the queue  
Just waiting for the name on their tattoo  
  
Emptiness has filled a vacant heart  
Finally found a place for it to hide  
And as I wander like a fool from bar to bar  
Empty has become my greatest guide  
  
And the tears and the pain and the despise  
Looked at me through bankrupt eyes  
They had nowhere else that they could land  
So I invited them to take my bloody hand  
  
So queuing for a tattoo and I can't decide the name  
I've been wondering night after night  
When they put that needle in me I'll scream your name in pain  
And I hope he spells 'you bastard' right  
  
B-A-S-T-A-R-D, stick that needle deep in me


Well the dice that I roll never seems to land on six  
And that 48 card pack is short of some of my old tricks  
The horse I bet on all those years ago  
Is probably still running round the track  
Like the marriage that I gambled on  
I'm due my money back, I'm due my money back  
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites  
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light  
If your country code or your green cross code  
It can leave a lasting mark  
History books have showed follow safety code  
And stamp out your final spark  
Well the husband that I married once  
I should've kept him in a cage  
Kept him sitting waiting there  
To show the tortoise middle-age  
Cause you never back an animal that struggles on two legs  
I'd rather back a stray with three than one that sits up and just begs  
Than one that sits up and just begs  
We could've learned, we could've burned from the firework love ignites  
But that sparkler of romance proved impossible to light  
If your country code or your green cross code  
It can leave a lasting mark  
History books have showed follow safety code  
And stamp out your final spark

Milk will curdle, cheese go off, expensive wine mature  
Kids grow up, parents down, husbands turn to tragic bore  
Receipts and life insurance all very well, but don't fully cover hate  
So you can't return this idiot when he's past his sell-by date

This table has four sturdy legs  
And a heart of very near wild oak  
When others would have screamed out loud my friend  
This one never even spoke  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
This table's been pushed against the door  
When tempers, well tempers flare at night  
Banged upon with knuckles clenched my friend  
When someone thinks that they are right  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
Tables only turn when tables learn  
Put me on a bonfire, watch me burn  
Treat me with some dignity, don't treat me like a slave  
Or I'll turn into the coffin in your grave

Your figure like your friendship  
Gradually grows and grows  
The clothes that you thought that you'd shrunk  
Their size just froze  
  
When the body that you thought of as yours  
Just ups and goes  
I'll be happy with the weight  
Of the partner that I chose  
  
Your quick-step is slower  
But your spirit's still out on the floor  
And you can still hack it  
'Cause you know what your feet are free for  
And I'll love my dear  
'Til you can't tuck it in anymore, anymore  
  
Your second grey hair came a month  
After the first  
It didn't make you better  
But it didn't make you feel any worse  
  
Your third grey hair appeared  
With the fourth on your beard  
Your fifth, sixth, seventh sprouted out  
From your nose and your ears  
  
And I'll love you my partner  
'Til you can't hide the grey anymore  
Your distinguished good looks  
Am the ones young girls cannot ignore  
And I'll love you my partner  
'Til the grey hairs hairdressers floor, hairdressers floor  
  
Your eighth and your ninth and your tenth  
You just looked to the sky  
Like the charge of the Light Brigade  
Was passing you by  
  
Your quick-step is slower  
But your spirit's still out on the floor  
When it comes to raw beauty  
You've a whole whorehouse waiting in store  
Your corset has grown  
Bid you're still always first to the drawer  
  
And I'll love you my partner (And I'll love you my partner)  
'Til the grey hairs the hairdresser's floor  
Hairdresser's floor, hairdresser's floor


Revolutions come and go but we'll just have to wait  
The time is nigh to sit and plot exactly who you hate  
  
Sirens in the neighbourhood  
The gun must be misunderstood  
A warden in a pool of blood  
The palace laugh and so they should  
  
Across the world in every coup a thousand guns without a clue  
If only all the people knew, they've got their sight set up on you  
  
Every war is always cursed  
With "just who do you shoot at first?"  
Think real hard and think Sandhurst  
Take an officer he's the worst  
  
Governments will rise and fall but royalty's still there  
Don't worry if it's Queen or Duke try scything down the pair  
And if you class the palace staff as devil's advocator  
Just put them in an incubator and we'll deal with them later  
  
Just a little bit later  
  
We'll deal with you later  
  
Just put them in an incubator and we'll deal with them later  
Just throw them to the alligators and we'll deal with them later  
  
So be wary of the liquidator  
'cause we'll deal with you later  
Just put them in a liquidator  
And we'll deal with you later  
  
We'll deal with you later.


White teeth, white teeth  
  
Talent is rugged determination  
Skill is a little more dull  
Genius buggers straight conversation  
Makes sure that it's ass is full  
  
So good looking people don't write no poetry  
They're too busy holding their hands  
You don't go to beach for depth of thought  
If your brain's leaking grains of sand  
  
'Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth  
False gums never make plans  
Little stones hold big stories underneath  
But the big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
  
When model puts pen to paper  
Paper tends to turn to stone  
'Cause original thoughts so hard to squeeze  
From a face so easy to clone  
  
So good looking people don't write no poetry  
They're too busy holding their hands  
You don't go to beach for depth of thought  
If your brain's leaking grains of sand  
  
'Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth  
False gums never make plans  
Little stones hold big stories underneath  
But the big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
  
Whilst the dedicated cancelled the dates on their latest tour  
'Cause genius had played that route ten times before  
Hardwork made the excuse of being too hardcore  
Yes don't fire shots from double barrel if you know you're single bore  
  
'Cos white teeth are uglier than yellow teeth  
False gums never make plans  
Little stones hold big stories underneath  
But the big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance  
The big stones go to the dance


There's a boy with a brace across his teeth  
White socks, tattooed underneath  
Bus tickets chitched up in his palm  
Stood there he's spinning a yarn  
There's a girl with a plastic pair of shoes  
Two eyes permanently bruised  
Can't find the time to be alarmed  
Just stood spinning a yarn  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
My name is Derek from the den  
I deal in shillings and in pence  
I'll get you any deal you like  
Ten sweets for a mountain bike you like  
My name is Mandy from the yard  
I deal in crazy tarot cards  
I'll tell you what the future brings  
One cat and a dog that sings  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums


I got chills  
They're multiplying  
And I'm losing control  
Cause the power you're supplying  
  
It's electrifying!  
You better shape up  
Cause I need a man  
And my heart is set on you  
  
You better shape up  
You better understand  
To my heart I must be true  
Nothing left  
  
Nothing left for me to do  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
The one that I want  
  
Oo-oo-oo  
The one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need  
Oh, yes indeed  
  
If you're filled  
With affection  
You're too shy to convey  
Better take my direction  
  
Feel your way  
Feel your way  
You better shape up  
'Cause I need a man  
  
Who can keep me satisfied  
You better shape up  
If you're gonna prove  
That my faith is justified  
  
Are you sure  
Yes I'm sure down deep inside  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need  
  
Oh, yes indeed  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
You're the one that I want  
  
Oo-oo-oo  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need  
Oh, yes indeed  
  
You're the one that I want  
You're the one that I want  
The one I need  
Oh, yes indeed


Don't look inside a stocking  
Don't look under the tree  
The one thing we're looking for  
Is something we can't see  
Far more precious than silver  
And more splendid than gold  
Is something to treasure  
But is something we can't hold  
  
As long as there's Christmas  
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll receive (we'll receive)  
  
As we all pray together  
It's the time to rejoice  
And though we may look different  
We are singing with one voice  
  
As Long As there's Christmas  
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll recieve  
  
There is more (so much more)  
To this time of year (to this time of year)  
Than sleigh bells and holly  
Mistletoes and snow  
Those things will come and go  
Come and goooo  
  
As long as there is Christmas  
I truly do believe that  
Hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We will receive (we'll receive)  
  
As Long As there's Christmas  
I truly believe (I truly believe)  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll recieve  
  
That Hope Is the Greatest gift we'll receive!


Belle  
  
There's something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined  
But now he's dear, and so unsure  
I wonder why I didn't see it there before  
  
Mme. De la grande bouche  
  
Come along dearie.  
Let's get you off those wet things.  
  
Beast  
  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw  
No it can't be, I'll just ignore  
But then she's never looked at me that way before  
  
Beast  
  
Belle, I have something to show you.  
But first, you have to close your eyes.  
It's a surprise!  
  
Belle  
  
May I open them?  
  
Beast  
  
Alright, alright. Now!  
  
Belle  
  
I can't believe it!  
I've never seen so many books in my whole life!  
  
Beast  
  
You like it?  
  
Belle  
  
It's wonderful!  
  
Beast  
  
It's yours!  
  
Belle  
  
New and a bit alarming  
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?  
True that he's no Prince Charming  
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see  
  
(spoken)  
Oh, this is one of my favorites!  
It's "King Arthur."  
Have you ever read it?  
  
Beast  
  
No.  
  
Belle  
  
You don't know what you're missing.  
I'd love to read this again.  
Wait... You can read this first.  
  
Beast  
  
No, that's alright  
  
Belle  
  
No, really, you read it  
  
Beast  
  
Oh, no, you...  
  
Belle  
  
No, you  
  
Beast  
  
No! I can't...  
  
Belle  
  
You never learned to read?  
  
Beast  
  
Only a little, and long ago  
  
Belle  
  
Well, it just so happens that this is the perfect book to read aloud. Come
here, sit by me  
  
Lumiere  
  
Well, who'd have thought?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Well, bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth  
  
Well, who'd have known?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Well, who indeed?  
  
Lumiere  
  
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
It's so peculiar. Wait and see  
  
Lumiere and cogsworth  
  
We'll wait and see  
  
All three  
  
A few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Cogsworth  
  
Perhaps there's something there  
That wasn't there before  
  
Chip  
  
What?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Chip  
  
What's there, Mama?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Ssh. I'll tell you when you're older.  
Come along now. Let's give them some privacy...  
  
Chip  
  
Mama?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Yes, Chip  
  
Chip  
  
Will I ever get to be a boy again?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
I hope so  
  
Chip  
  
When will I know?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Soon. If it's to be. It will be very soon now. Come along, son.  
  
Belle  
  
Knowing now, that this was indeed the legendary sword called "Excalibur,"
Arthur tried to pull it from the stone. He tried  
Once to no avail. He tried a second time, but still, he could not pull it out.
Then, for the third time, Arthur drew forth the  
Sword...  
  
Beast  
  
So that must mean he's the king!  
  
Belle  
  
Wait and see  
  
Beast  
  
I never knew books could do that  
  
Belle  
  
Do what?  
  
Beast  
  
Take me away from this place, make me forget for a little while  
  
Belle  
  
Forget?  
  
Beast  
  
Who I... What I am...  
  
Belle  
  
We have something in common, you know  
  
Beast  
  
What is that?  
  
Belle  
  
In the town where I come from, the people think I'm odd  
  
Beast  
  
You?  
  
Belle  
  
So, I know how it feels to be... Different. And I know how lonely that can be  
  
Belle  
  
For the third time, Arthur drew forth the sword, and there arose from the
people a great shout. Arthur is king.  
  
Beast  
  
I told you so...


[Intro]  
Tale as old as time  
True as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Then somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
[Verse 1]  
Just a little change  
Small to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the beast  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will rise  
  
[Chorus]  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bitter sweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  
  
[Bridge]  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
  
[Chorus]  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as rhyme  
Beauty and the beast x2  
  
[Outro]  
Off to the cupboard with you Chip it's past your bed time  
Goodnight love


Belle:  
There's something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean  
And he was course  
And unrefined  
And now he's dear  
And so I'm sure  
I wonder why I didn't see it there before  
  
Beast:  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched  
She didn't shudder at my paw  
No it can't be  
I'll just ignore  
But then she's never looked at me that way before  
  
Belle:  
New and a bit alarming  
Who'd have ever thought that this could be  
True that he's no prince charming  
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see  
  
Lumiere:  
Well who'd have thought  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well who'd have known  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well who indeed  
  
Lumiere:  
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own  
  
Ms. Potts:  
It's so peculiar  
  
Ms. Potts, cogsworth, lumiere  
We'll wait and see a few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before  
  
Ms. Potts:  
There may be something there that wasn't there before


One year, two years, time goes by.  
People laugh and people cry.  
Every morning the clock strikes eight.  
I go to work.  
I close the gate.  
And on my way, I sing a song.  
About my wife, where I belong.  
  
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me.  
Only you can see me.  
  
For what I've got  
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not  
For I am he with something more  
It's you and I reality.  
  
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby, make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me  
Only you can see me  
  
Two years on two years on


I've discovered for myself this time  
The start of everything to me  
Is to know our love is older than the sea  
But don't let another flame inside  
Your fire-proof heart  
'Cause I'm not your full-time lover  
And it's tearing me apart  
I've been hangin' on this line too long  
  
855-7019  
Don't you ever answer  
855-7019  
Don't you hear the word  
Search for a sign , baby  
She was the past and the future  
I just got burned  
855-7019  
Is a private number  
I know in your mind that you think  
It's a crime, but I had to call  
First and last , there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes  
And I'm a slave to all the lies  
And I'm forever lost  
I believe in you and me  
Together and it keeps this love alive  
  
855-7019  
Don't you ever answer  
855-7019  
Don't you hear the word  
Search for the sign , baby  
She was the past and the future  
I just got burned  
  
I have suffered for my sins today  
With the pain of love  
Before the dawning comes  
The darker is the night  
I'm born to be the one to share your life  
That shows I don't need no operator  
I don't want no one to know  
How much I need you  
  
855-7019  
Don't you ever answer  
I know in your mind that you think  
It's a crime , but I had to call  
First and the last , there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes and I'm a slave to all the lies  
And I'm forever lost  
I believe in you and me together  
And it keeps this love alive


Woman in a million to me  
I've never loved so much  
Is it any wonder I'm alive  
No one ever knows what makes a  
Virtue or a vice  
Let it be the spell I'm under  
(These naked eyes)  
Let it be the rain and thunder comes  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives, oh,  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and the soul  
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold  
Love is the key and the cause  
And its makin' us whole  
  
Made me a little crazy, but I  
Soon realize my fate  
Every little touch I'm paralized  
No one ever knows what makes  
An angel in disguise  
Let me be the one to taste you  
Those naked eyes  
No pity if the city ever crumbles down  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives, oh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and we share  
Love is the force and the edge  
And its ready for those who dare  
Love is above and beyond  
And I'm taking you there  
(And baby I'll take you there)  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives, ohh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and the soul  
Love is the key and the cause  
And it's making us whole  
Love is the force and the edge  
And its yours if you dare  
Love is above and beyond  
And I'm taking you there  
(Baby I'll take you there)  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives oh,  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me


There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind  
Where you are, there is a different feeling  
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin', opens up your eyes  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]  
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low  
I wanna be there, I wanna be there  
We leave immediately  
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low  
I wanna be there, I wanna be there  
We leave immediately, after dark  
  
There is no limit that I would not go if I could lie beside  
Where you are, there is a different world out there  
Love in the jungle can be hard to realize  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind  
Where you are, there is a different feeling  
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin', opens up your eyes  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]


Maybe you talk too high, man.  
Maybe I talk too slow.  
But you've got to live a little bit faster  
'cause you've got a little less time to go.  
  
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.  
But then you know me very well.  
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way.  
I'm a fool and I can tell .  
  
That I'm alive and that's all.  
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.  
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.  
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.  
I don't know about the people that I read about in books.  
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.  
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive .  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive , alive.  
  
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.  
But then you know me very well.  
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way.  
I'm a fool and I can tell.  
  
That I'm alive and that's all .  
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.  
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.  
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.  
I don't know about those people that I read about in books.  
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.  
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive.  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive.  
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive.  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive, alive.


I know my street , that's where I live  
I never take , I always give  
They always leave me on the shelf  
I live my life all by myself  
My car ain't big , I can't go fast  
And ev'ry drink I take's the last  
I'm always tryin' to save my health  
I live my life all by myself  
Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me  
I'm a man who stands alone  
That's where I'll be  
That's where I'll be  
So take your hand down off my chair  
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there  
And I ain't neve seen no wealth  
I live my live all by myself  
My car ain't big , I can't go fast  
And ev'ry drink I take's the last  
I'm always tryin' to save my health  
I live my life all by myself  
Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me  
I'm a man who stands alone  
That's where I'll be  
That's where I'll be  
That's where I'll be  
So take your hand down off my chair  
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there  
And I ain't never seen no wealth  
I live my live all by myself  
I live my life all by myself  
  


Baby , oh no , I've been stuck here  
I've been searchin' so long  
Baby don't go , millions of people were wrong  
In the dark of the cold light of day ,  
I will still be here  
If my heart and my soul had their way ,  
you would still be here  
  
Another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
'Cause my baby's no longer around  
And my feeling can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world  
  
Baby , you said , a guy like me was way out of line  
And knowing today , your leavin' was a question of time  
In the mist of a sweet summer rain ,you will find me here  
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way ,  
I'll be holdin' near  
Another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
'Cause my baby's no longer around  
And my feelings can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world  
  
(break)  
In the dark of the cold light of day ,  
you will find me here  
If my heart and my soul had their way ,  
you would still be here  
  
Another lonely night in New York  
And I'm just a soul in the heart of the city  
Just another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
Just another lonely night in New York ( fade )


Where are you ? I love you . Where are you ? I love you .  
Where are you to keep me warm?  
  
I had a dream of a place far away.  
I followed a river where the dead man would play.  
And I'm leaving in the morning.  
And I'm leaving in the morning.  
  
And I won't die, so don't cry. I'll be home.  
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me.  
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea.  
  
And you a man who's as tall as the sky  
Followed a river where thousands have died.  
He was leaving in the morning.  
He was leaving in the morning.  
  
If I come home and my women has flown.  
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me  
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Say goodbye to auld lang syne [Repeat until fade]


Living in a world that dies within,  
you are they who try and touch the wind.  
You could be the blessed one  
that makes me love you.  
  
And doing what you've never done before,  
taking every wave that hits the shore,  
you could be a silver star that shines  
on my blue island.  
It's gonna be a blue island.  
See you on a blue island.  
Take you to a blue island.  
  
Blue island.  
  
You can see the rain.  
You can feel the pain  
that no part of me is going through.  
  
Everybody say  
we can find a way.  
Do you know the place you're going to?  
  
You're going to a blue island.  
  
This is what the lonely heart must know.  
This is what it takes to make it grow.  
You could be a child alone.  
But you may save the world.  
  
Maybe it's the words that mean goodbye.  
There but for the grace of God go I.  
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island.  
  
Gonna be a blue island.  
See you on a blue island.  
Take you to a blue island.  
  
Blue island.  
Blue island.  
Blue island.


It hurts me when you cry  
When you feel the love is gone  
Don't give up on us  
When you got so much to believe in  
And I beg you please stay  
Strangers in the night  
A flame that never dies  
In a world of lonely faces  
You need someone to survive  
A heart like yours  
Should never live alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Lost inside  
It's only you and me  
  
There's things you shouldn't do  
You lose your self control  
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger  
Take you down to a new sensation  
Just turn back to me  
Don't wait till its gone  
Don't go where you don't belong  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours  
Should always find a home  
  
I know the signs and I'm telling you  
You're living on borrowed time  
But a heart needs love  
Like a flower needs rain  
Like I'm making you mine  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
What we had never known all our lives  
I pray its not too late  
I would die by your side my love  
I'm the life that you save  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours should never live alone  
  
I used to dream of a special one  
And now I feel it coming true  
But I could'nt let go, I'm a jealous guy  
What you're putting me through  
I'm begging you  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far  
  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far


When I was just a little boy, when I didn't know  
My daddy put me n his knee and showed me the way to go  
He said "a woman will do her best to make a fool out of you  
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do"  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
If you got what it takes my boy  
You can always choose  
Work it out before it's too late my boy  
Make sure you never lose  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man  
  
Every woman wants her man to live and learn on her land  
Where I go, baby you go  
Arrangement, man and wife  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man


I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then , hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa  
Ev'rybody said the kid's no good  
  
Come Home Johnny Bride come home  
Johnny Bride come home  
We're all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
It's his role we had you filling  
We didn't really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad  
  
(repeat last verse and fade out about line 6)


Look at me, I don't know what I'm doin'  
ever since I looked at you  
How did I get this crazy feelin'  
Could it be, I'm in love with you  
  
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight  
I've had this feeling through and through  
Since that time, I haven't done a thing right  
Could it be, I'm in love with you  
  
Golly gee, I don't know where I'm goin'  
I'm tryin' to make you see  
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me, oh  
  
Night after night, I'm always dreamin'  
Why don't you make those dreams come true  
Can't you see how much I really love you  
Why don't you learn to love me too  
  
Golly gee, I don't know where I'm goin'  
I'm tryin' to make you see  
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me  
  
Night after night, I'm always dreamin'  
Why don't you make those dreams come true  
Can't you see how much I really love you  
Why don't you learn to love me too  
Love me too  
Love me too


I don't know what you want, I don't hear what you said.  
Truth behind the lies.  
'Cause I can't see what's in your head.  
And spread your wings and fly, out in a brave new world.  
Let this be my prayer, to keep you safe when I'm not there.  
  
Can we love and live apart?  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
How can we divide the heart?  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith).  
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word.  
Embrace.  
  
Through the mists of time, lovers can be friends.  
The power of the human heart.  
The secrets in the souls of men.  
All my blessings in disguise.  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
Reunited we will rise.  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith).  
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
Another daybreak, another heartache,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives,  
Away from you.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely life.  
Lonely days and nights (away from you).  
We can live our life  
(embrace, embrace)  
With our separate lives.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Lonely days and nights.  
I will never send away.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Embrace the child inside  
The lonely, lonely lives.


Dark is the night, high is the fire,  
Touches the sky, love with no shape or form.  
I am in your mind's eye, just let your dreams run wild.  
  
Somewhere, out across the nation,  
Someone, waiting in the shadows,  
Listen, I don't want to hear  
"return to sender"  
Calling. I can see the future,  
Someday, signal with a single motion  
Show me you believe in someone, somewhere.  
  
Oh baby, you give me,  
You give me the runaround,  
Just another night with you,  
You're on my mind.  
And we got love,  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher.  
  
E. S. P.  
I communicate with you,  
Tell me what it means to feel,  
What am I supposed to do.  
E. S. P.  
Nothing any words can say,  
Nothing that we know is real,  
But it'll take your breath away,  
Your breath away.  
  
Danger, suddenly an early warning,  
Suddenly the soul is burning,  
But I still believe in someone, somewhere.  
  
Baby, you give me,  
You give me the runaround,  
Just another night with you,  
I'm in your mind.  
And we got love,  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher.  
  
E. S. P.  
I communicate with you,  
Tell me what it means to feel,  
What am I supposed to do  
E. S. P.  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher.  
Be prepared to make your sacrifice, tonight,  
Far beyond the point of no return, oh no.  
And we got love,  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher, higher and higher,  
Higher and higher, higher and higher.  
  
Oh, oh, oh,  
What am I supposed to do,  
Supposed to do.  
Oh, oh, oh,  
But it'll take your breath away,  
Your breath away.  
  
E. S. P.  
I communicate with you,  
Tell me what it means to feel,  
What am I supposed to do,  
Supposed to do.  
E. S. P.  
Nothing any words can say,  
Nothing that we know is real,  
But it'll take your breath away,  
Your breath, your breath away.  
E.S.P.  
Nothing any words can say,  
Nothing that we know is real,  
But it'll take your breath away.

Ev'ry second, ev'ry minute (repeat line and fade out)


First I rise, then I fall  
Seems like you don't want the love  
Of this man at all  
And it's sure been a lonely time  
Right up to the time I met you  
So if you take a love like mine  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to hurt me  
Fanny, be tender with my love,  
'Cause it's all that I've got  
And my love won't desert me  
  
So you say to yourself, boy,  
You're out of your brain  
Do you think I'm gonna stand here  
All night in the rain?  
And it's the start of a love affair  
The moment when I first met you  
And if you want I'll take you there  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to break it  
Fanny, be tender with my love  
'Cause it's all that I've got  
And my love won't forsake me.  
  
With my love,  
Our love will seal it together.  
Oh, with our love,  
You made a promise  
You'll always love me forever.  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to break it  
Fanny, be tender with my love,  
'Cause it's all that I've got  
And my love won't forsake me.  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to break it  
Fanny, be tender with my love,  
'Cause it's all that I've got  
And my love won't forsake me.  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to hurt me  
Fanny, be tender with my love,  
'Cause it's all that I've got  
And my love won't desert me  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to break it  
Fanny, be tender with my love  
'Cause it's all that I've got  
And my love won't desert me  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to hurt me  
Fanny, be tender with my love


I'm so weary from holding this load  
But it's only, love for you, that I walk this lonely road  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
And the wind will take me hold before the cold  
  
Every stay I have counted  
Each flower I have seen  
But the place where I'm going, there's no grass as green  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
And the wind will take me home where I can dream  
  
In the hour I am lonely, you're love will be mine  
I will stay in your arms dear, until comes the time  
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere  
I have no time to stay, I have no time to care  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair  
  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair


Take me to your world of wonder  
Let me come inside your room  
Invisible  
Now you see nothin'  
Some investigation as to the state of us  
No misunderstanding girl  
On either side  
  
I couldn't lie if I try any other way  
I can't stop thinking of that girl of mine  
I'm for the rise and the fall  
Any other way and  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
You shouldn't do it, you shouldn't do it  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
Who can stop your past from rushing by  
Born to live one million stories high  
Into the night  
Into the day  
  
Take me to a town or country  
Stranger in a strange land  
And I'm an alien  
No you can't find me  
You be there at the station  
When the train arrives  
When it leaves I get my hands on you  
  
I fool myself if I turn any other way  
I still keep searchin' for that girl of mine  
I'm for the hell of it all  
  
Do it anyway and  
  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
Hearts can break and hearts can  
Turn the tide  
All is love and love is open wide  
Ghost train  
Ghost train  
Into the night  
Into the day


I know that you want a man  
To love you like no other can  
Here I am , here I am  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
I'm gonna prove that my love was made for only you  
If you don't believe me ,watch and you'll see me  
Make you love me too  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
(break)  
Here I am , here I am  
(break)  
Here I am , here I am  
I'm gonna prove that my love was made for only you  
If you don't believe me , watch and you'll see me  
Make you love me too  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
Here I am , here I am  


Cryin' in the streets  
They run for their lives  
How can you lead them to heaven  
They don't realize  
Children of the night  
How far can we fall  
That which we say is forever  
Ain't no time at all  
  
Father and the son  
Not too young to be old  
Reach out for each other when  
The world goes cold  
Feel so good to be home  
Are you ready for  
  
[Chorus:]  
My high civilization  
Are you ready for  
My high civilization  
Are you ready for  
My high civilization  
Civilization  
  
Everything for us to see  
The ultimate society  
  
Keeper of the sword  
You fight for your rights  
How can you live for the hour  
When there's no yesterday  
Dyin' in the streets  
Your number your name  
All that which keeps us together  
Is bringing us the pain  
  
Thunder of the guns  
Comes the criminal mind  
Working for the power of  
The evil eye  
We are never alone  
Uncivilized  
  
[Chorus]  
  
New York, Paris, Tokyo  
Vienna to Berlin  
Baby don't know you  
L.A., Rome, Afghanistan  
Cairo to Iran  
No city can hold you  
There's no one in Avalon to show you  
Minutes into seconds are you ready  
For the end  
  
[Chorus]


I don't believe in love  
Im not afraid of the night  
People who follow their hearts survive  
  
Don't need the chains of life  
I am no refugee  
They say that the eyes of the soul surrender  
  
Give me little lovin , can we set the world alight  
Evry thing I wanted walking right beside me ,baby  
When I think Im losin , I just look at you and  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Burnin through the night  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't know if I can make it on my own  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Destination , your desire  
And baby , oh sweet baby  
  
I can't agree with war  
Its not important to me  
The stranger that stands in the wind survives  
  
Give me little lovin , can we set the world ali ght  
Evry thing I wanted walking right beside me baby  
When I think Im losin , I just look at you and  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Burnin through the night  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't know if I can make it on my own  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Burnin through the night  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't now if I can make it on my own  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Destination , your desire  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't know if I can make it on my own


I can make the sun shine out of the heavens  
Sweet love, love you forever  
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
  
I can change the whole world if you are near me  
No tears if you can hear me  
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got, yeah  
  
Ah  
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got  
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got


Do you love me women , truly do ya?  
Can you feel this feeling going through ya?  
Are you of the mind that we should live together through this night?  
Or tell me you're my virgin queen and it may not be right.  
  
But don't make me say , i can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down  
Just thinking of your face and it won't be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside , stealing my pride  
I can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down 'cause you won't be around  
  
When all this world of ours is falling apart  
I'll keep on hanging on and fixing my heart  
'Cause ev'ryone is just like me they're praying in the sun  
And i may be that lucky man surviving when they're gone  
  
But don't make me say , i can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down  
Just thinking of your face and it won't be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside , stealing my pride  
I can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down 'cause you won't be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside , stealing my pride  
I can't let you , can't let you go  
And it's breaking my down 'cause you won't be around  
  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go (fade out)


Close your eyes do what you wanna  
Baby how can I wait much longer  
Make it hard to believe it happened to me  
Morning comes too late tomorrow  
All you lose is the dream you borrow  
All you got is a soul that's born to be free  
and cries to the wind  
Waiting for you  
My dream will find you someday  
I stand beside my vision of you  
And have you loving me  
  
I still love you  
I still love you  
  
Though you're my imagination  
You be there when we find salvation  
Only then will there be no reason to hide  
Stormy night out in the heaven  
I believe in the true forever  
There's a bright new star when somebody dies  
I cry to the wind  
Waiting for you  
Sweet love returning someday  
The day you learn love happened to you  
You will be here with me  
  
I still love you  
I still love you  
  
I'll be waiting for you  
Sweet love returning someday  
The day you learn love happened to you  
You will be here with me  
  
I still love you  
I still love you  
I still [Repeats]


When I was you we walked to school  
And I carried your books 'cause even then I was a fool  
But you grew up and said goodbye  
I still remember the things that made me cry  
  
For all too soon my story ends  
I found a love, now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
  
I held your hand and I told you things  
And I made you believe, believe in fairy tales  
And diamond rings  
  
Hen all too soon my story ends  
I found a love ,now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
Ah...


When I wake up in the morning  
There's something on my mind  
And suddenly without warning  
Somebody's standing behind  
And it's you , babe  
And it's you , babe  
  
If I were the sky , I could look down onto you  
That one day , if you join me , ev'ry sky will be blue  
Ev'ry day with you  
  
You know I still think you owe me  
I dream ev'ry night that you do  
So what is it that's making me lonely  
I've known all along what it is  
And it's you , babe  
And it's you , babe  
  
If I were the sky , I could look down onto you  
That one day , if you join me , ev'ry sky will be blue  
Ev'ry day with you  
  
If I were the sky , I could look down onto you  
That one day , if you join me , ev'ry sky will be blue  
Ev'ry day with you  
With you  
With you


With you , baby I'm satisfied , making my love to you  
'Cause you got me hypnotized  
And you came to me alone girl  
I was a heart that's made of stone girl  
  
And you broke it down in pieces  
And you took me for your own girl  
I lie beneath your ecstasy  
You can pour it all over me  
  
I won't break the chains of loving you  
We got everything , anybody needs  
And it's here with me ,with you  
Baby I'm satisfied , makin' my love to you  
  
(Makin' my love , makin' my love)  
'Cause you got me hypnotized  
Before you took me by the hand girl  
I was a statue in the sand girl  
  
I was broken down for reasons  
You could never understand girl  
I was living on desire  
But that was just the way we were  
  
'Til you make a world of love in you  
We got everything , anybody needs  
And it's here with me , with you  
Baby I'm satisfied , making my love to you  
  
'Cause you got me hypnotized  
Anytime you wander, get yourself back to me girl  
Any cloud you're under , you got to get yourself free girl  
Ahh, ahh, baby with you  
  
Baby I'm satisfied , making' my love to you  
'Cause you got me hypnotized , oh baby , with you [Repeat]


Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside  
There was something going on  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha  
  
I can't live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha


You've had your troubles Israel  
I've seen them all  
But you put the writing on the wall  
Israel Israel yeah  
  
You know I've seen you fall so many times  
I've cried for you and that's a crime  
Israel Israel Israel  
  
Where there's sand  
Where there's beautiful sand yeah  
You know you got a kind of feeling  
That's just grand  
Take me into your arms  
Let me be with you  
Israel Israel Israel  
  
I like the smiles up on your people's faces  
They make you feel warm embraces  
And I want that kind of smile  
that kind of smile  
Israel you make the whole world think about you  
And if they don't they'll find a reason  
to shout about Israel Israel  
  
You're the only one Israel Israel  
Tell me all about it!  
Tell me all about it  
Tell me all about it  
Oh take me into your arms

Let me hold hold you to myself  
Oh I want to Israel  
  
Israel Oh take me back into into your arms  
Israel Israel Israel Israel  
Israel


It's just the way that I feel about tomorrow  
I'll be sad and alone all the time  
It's just the way that you said you don't love me anymore, then 'Goodbye'  
I can't believe what you're saying  
You don't love me anymore, 'Goodbye'  
  
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow  
Knowing you won't be there by my side  
I wish that I could say to you: well, can't we just be good friends?  
Would you leave the door open, let me walk in again?  
  
That's the way I been thinking 'bout tomorrow  
I only know that friends can't be lovers again


It's just your jive talkin'  
You're telling me lies, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You wear a disguise  
Jive talkin'  
So misunderstood, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You really no good  
  
Oh, my child  
You'll never know  
Just what you mean to me  
Oh, my child  
You got so much  
You're gonna take away my energy  
  
With all your jive talkin'  
You're telling me lies, yeah  
Good lovin'  
Still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believes what you say  
It's just your jive talkin'  
That gets in the way  
  
Oh my love  
You're so good  
Treating me so cruel  
There you go  
With your fancy lies  
Leavin' me lookin'  
Like a dumbstruck fool  
With all your  
  
Jive talkin'  
You're telling me lies, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You wear a disguise  
Jive talkin'  
So misunderstood, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You just ain't no good  
  
Love talkin'  
Is all very fine, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
Just isn't a crime  
And if there's somebody  
You'll love till you die  
Then all that jive talkin'  
Just gets in your eye  
  
Jive talkin'  
You're telling me lies,yeah  
Good lovin'  
Still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believes what you say  
It's just your jive talkin'  
That gets in the way  
  
Love talkin'  
Is all very fine, yeah  
Jive talkin', just isn't a crime  
And if there's somebody  
You'll love till you die  
Then all that jive talkin'  
Just gets in your eye, yeah yeah  
  
Oh jive talkin'  
Jive talkin'  
Oh jive talkin'


All the love of my mother, I offer to you  
And I'll try so very hard , to get you through  
If lay down my life, for my King and country men  
Would it change you for the better  
It better be all right  
To be always like children  
Afraid of the night  
  
If I gave up the cause , what would you give me  
to make up for all the things that I would lose  
If I lay down my life , for my King and country men  
Would it change you for the better  
It better be all right  
To be always like children  
Afraid of the night  
  
Well you better get busy , get it over and done  
I was here when you arrived , I'll be here when you're gone  
If I give up my life for my King and country men  
Would it change you for the better  
It better be all right  
To be never like people  
Afraid of the night  
  
Do do do , etc ... (fade out)


Pardon me, if I use you in my dreams  
You throw those angel eyes at me  
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems  
But she is not in love with me  
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away  
A chip on my shoulder, a misery, suddenly there you are  
Nobody knows, but she knows that I love her  
It's got to be growing  
I can't wait no longer  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
When love goes wrong only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams , we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Suddenly, all the world gets in the way  
You disappear into the crowd  
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came  
But I still call your name out loud  
I want to know you , but I never met you  
Reality can be cruel  
If a wandering soul meets another  
They shouldn't be separated  
Better in love with your head on my shoulder  
But I'll never be satisfied  
And if I can't see you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
When love goes wrong, only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Living your life in someone else's heart  
A lover's dream that has no end  
There may be somebody you can base your world upon  
I'll never be the same again  
And there's a part of me here  
And there's a part of me with you  
But all of me loves you  
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me  
I'm so proud of  
All of my days I will be here for you  
And the love keeps running  
And if I can't hold you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I


Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday.  
But be alive, I know that we will.  
The world keeps on moving but I'm holding still.  
  
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny.  
That would arrive the moment you're born.  
For we will be here when the miracle comes.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Living eyes when under the sun don't cry.  
No war in my mind.  
The state of my heart.  
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall.  
The day I deny the face of my love.  
  
[Bridge:]  
We are of age, we are in time, we are forever.  
Right now when the power is mine.  
I leave you Heaven and the Earth, I leave you never.  
And living to love is the reason to shine.  
  
I been over I been under I don't own a dream to analyze.  
But living eyes you know that I do.  
Believe in the soul and the magic of you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]


If your mind is in the darkness, could you know  
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow  
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind  
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind  
  
And as soon as you discover where you're goin'  
Can I walk along the way, along the way  
I'm lonesome and I need somebody knowin'  
Just a few nice words to get me through the day  
  
If your mind is in the darkness, could you know  
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow  
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind  
Or is this world just a frame of mind  
  
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home  
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone  
  
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home  
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone  
  
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone [Repeat: x4]  
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home


Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of being so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of being so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone  
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone  
  
I lay my heart on you and you can show the way  
I give my everlasting love until my dying day  
Take this lonely soul , the water or the wine  
A chance to make you mine  
I lay my body on the line  
  
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' together ,livin' together instead of bein' alone  
Why ain't we livin' together ,livin' together instead of bein' alone  
  
My life was emptiness until you came along  
I nearly fell apart , you took my heart and made me strong  
I need all of you to get me through the night  
A chance to see the light  
I lay my body on the line  
  
Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin',livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' together instead of bein' alone  
Why ain't we livin' together instead of bein' alone  
  
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' together , livin' together instead of bein' alone  
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone  
  
Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein so so far apart  
Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart(fade)


Look at my face. I know the years are showin'.  
Look at my life. Still don't know where it's goin'.  
I don't know much, but I know I love you,  
And that may be all I need to know.  
  
Look at these eyes. Oh, they never see what matters.  
And look at these dreams, so beaten and so battered.  
I don't know much, but I know I love you,  
And that may be all I need to know.  
  
So many questions and still no answers.  
I climb and climb but never get the view.  
But when I hold you near me sometimes I feel so clearly  
The only truth I'll ever know is me and you.  
  
In my heart I long for inspiration.  
And in my soul I know someday I'll find salvation.  
I don't know much, but I know I love you,  
And that may be all I need to know.  
  
In my heart you're my inspiration.  
And in my soul I know love is our salvation.  
I don't kow much, but if I know you love me,  
That will be all I need to know.  
I don't know much, but if you say you love me,  
That will be all I need to know.


Howard, the strangest things  
Have happened lately when I  
Take a good swing  
And all my dreams  
They pivot and slip.  
I drop my fists  
And they're back, laughing.  
  
Howard, my intentions  
Become not to lose what I've won.  
Ambition has given way  
To desperation and I,  
I've lost the fight from my eyes.  
  
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.  
Now I'm told,  
You're growing old.  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years I'd be through.  
Has boxing been good to you?  
  
Howard, now I confess  
I'm scared and lonely and tired.  
Everyone says I'm made of clay,  
That I've had my day,  
That I'm not cut out for this.  
I just know what to say.  
And I say,  
  
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.  
Now I'm told,  
You're growing old.  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years I'd be through.  
Has boxing been good to you?  
  
Well, sometimes I punch myself  
Hard as I can.  
Yelling, nobody cares!  
Hoping someone will tell me how wrong I am,  
Howard.  
  
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.  
Now I'm told,  
You're growing old.  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years I'd be through.  
Has boxing been good,  
Has boxing been good,  
Has boxing been good?


Daytime husler, you're out of line.  
Don't ya try to change my mind!  
Don't you try.  
You see, I ain't no fool.  
No, I can tell,  
Oh, baby, you ain't my kind!  
My kind!  
  
I'm in love with a down home man.  
Simple lovin' I can understand.  
I've been hustled by the best of them,  
And you ain't nothing but a crazy man.  
Hustler.  
  
Oh, daytime hustler, you better look away.  
Because I won't play your game no more.  
No, no more, no.  
You spend all of your money  
On those other women  
Who are blind enough to buy your shame.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,  
Let your heart be light  
From now on,  
Our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,  
Make the Yule-tide gay,  
From now on,  
Our troubles will be miles away.  
  
Here we are as in olden days,  
Happy golden days of yore.  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more.  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together,  
If the Fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.


I remember you.  
You're the one who made my dreams come true,  
A few kisses ago.  
  
I remember you.  
You're the one who said, "I love you, too.  
I do. Didn't you know?"  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell,  
And stars that fell  
Like rain out of the blue.  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all,  
Then I shall tell them I remember you.  
  
Was it in Tahiti?  
Were we on the Nile?  
Long, long ago, say, an hour or so,  
I recall that I saw your smile.  
  
And I remember, too, a distant bell,  
And stars that fell  
Like rain out of the blue.  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all,  
Then I will tell them I remember,  
Tell them I remember you.


"Gentlemen, gentlemen please! Senors, por favor!"  
  
I once met a man with a sense of adventure.  
He was dressed to thrill wherever he went.  
He said, "Let's make love on a mountaintop,  
under the stars on a big hard rock."  
  
I said, "In these shoes? What is this, the Peace Corps?"  
I said, "Honey, let's do it here."  
  
So we're sittin' at a bar in Guadalajara,  
in walks a guy with a faraway look in his eyes.  
He says, "I've got a powerful horse outside.  
Climb on the back, I'll take you for a ride.  
I know a little place we can get before the break of day."  
  
I said, "In these shoes? No way, Jose!"  
I said, "Honey, let's stay right here."  
  
No le gusta caminar.  
No puede montar a cabailo.  
?Como se puede bailar?  
Es un escandalo!  
  
Then I met an Englishman.  
"Oh," he said, "Are you American?  
Won't you walk up and down on my spine?  
It makes me feel strangely alive."  
  
I said, "In these shoes? Oh, I doubt you'd survive."  
I said, "Honey let's do it hehehehe"  
  
"Let's stay right here."  
  
No le gusta caminar.  
No puede montar a cabailo.  
?Como se puede bailar?  
Es un escandalo!  
  
No le gusta caminar.  
No puede montar a cabailo.  
?Como se puede bailar?  
Es un escandalo!  
  
No le gusta caminar.  
No puede montar a cabailo.  
?Como se puede bailar?  
Es un escandalo!  
  
No le gusta caminar.  
No puede montar a cabailo.  
?Como se puede bailar?


The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
I've got my love to keep me warm

So I will weather the storm!

"Hey, Betty? Is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Oh! Must be nice riding on that motorcycle after school, huh?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Is he picking you up after school today?"  
"Unh uh!"  
"Well, where'd ya meet him?"  
  
I met him at the candy store.  
He turned around and smiled at me.  
Ya get the picture? (Yes, we see)  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
My folks were always puttin' him down.  
Down! Down!  
They said he came from the wrong side of town.  
They told me that he was bad,  
But I knew that he was sad.  
And that's why I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
One day my dad said, "Find someone new."  
New! New!  
I had to tell my Jimmy that,  
Whoa, we were through.  
He stood up and then he asked me why.  
But all I could do was cry.  
I'm sorry I hurt you,  
The leader of the pack.  
  
He sort of smiled and he kissed me goodbye.  
The tears were beginning to show.  
And as he drove away from me  
On that rainy, rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow.  
But whether he heard me  
I'll never, never, never, never know!  
Look out now, now, look out!  
Whoa oh no no no! Whoa no no no! No! No!  
  
I felt so helpless! What could I do-wo-wo-wo-wo?  
The only, only love that we had was through.  
At school they all stop and stare.  
I can't hide the tears.  
I just don't care!  
I will never forget you,  
The leader of the pack!  
Whoa-oo-woh! Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is, whoa gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!


"Doctor Long John. My dreams are full of Doctor Long John."  
I got a dentist who's over seven feet tall.  
I have a dentist who's over seven feet tall.  
His name is Doctor Long John  
And he answers every call.  
  
You know, I went to Long John's office.  
I said, "Doctor, the pain is killing me."  
I went to Long John's office.  
I said, "Doctor, the pain is killing."  
He said, "Don't worry, baby.  
It's just your cavity needs a little filling."  
  
He took out his trusty drill.  
Told me to open wide.  
He said he wouldn't hurt me,  
But he filled my whole inside.  
Long John, Long John, don't you ever go away. No.  
Cause you thrill me when you drill me,  
And I don't need no novocain today.  
  
Oh, when he got done drilin' he said,  
"Now, Miss Midler, that is going to cost you ten."  
"I was prepared to pay twenty"  
Yeah, yeah, when he got done drillin' he said,  
"Baby, that is going to cost you ten.  
But if it ever starts in to throbbing,  
Come back and see old Long John  
Again and again and again and again and again.  
Oh, yeah. Yow!  
  
"Long John. I sold my heart to Doctor Long John and I will never, never be the
same.  
Oh, that's so heavy I just gotta lay back."


[Man:] "All right! She's gonna sing!"  
[Rose:] "All right, we all turn to page 438.  
Now, you know we all gonna sing along.  
Oh, I do love a revue."  
  
Ohhhhhh!  
You know, women don't like this woman,  
'cause I always speak my mind.  
But the men ain't crazy about me,  
'cause I love to take my time.  
  
If you're gonna love this woman,  
Gotta love me with a thrill,  
'cause, baby, if you don't,  
I gotta find a man who will.  
  
Love me with a feeling.  
You got to love me with a feelin'.  
You got to love me with a feelin',  
Or you don't love me at all.  
  
You know, I'm the kind of woman,  
I don't want no halfway stuff.  
If you're gonna turn me loose, baby,  
Be sure I had enough.  
  
You know, the cops once took me in,  
But I did not need the bail.  
I just shook it for the judge and he,  
He put that cop in jail.  
  
You got to love me with a feeling.  
You got to love me with a feelin'.  
You got to love me with a feelin',  
Or you don't love me at all.  
  
"All right, Milledge, this one's for you."  
There was one cat who could not make it,  
And Milledge was his name.  
The only cat I ever knew  
Who left before he came.  
  
There he's a-standing,  
Drinkin' pop from a paper cup.  
But when it's time for gettin' down,  
Milledge can not get it up!  
  
You gotta love me with a feelin'.  
Yeah, love, love me with a feelin'.  
You got to love me with a feelin',  
Or you can't love me at all.


Oooooh  
  
Lookin' back over my years  
I guess I've shed some tears.  
Told myself time and again  
This time I'm gonna win.  
  
But another fight. Things ain't right.  
I'm losing again.  
It takes a fool to lose twice  
And start all over again.  
  
I think I better let him go.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
Let it go, baby.  
I think I better let him go.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO. Ohh, yeah.  
  
I tried to take control of the love.  
He took control of me.  
See you lose all thought and sense of time.  
You have a change of mind.  
  
Takin' the bumps and the bruises  
And all the pain of a two-time lose.  
And I try to hold on. My faith is gone.  
It's just another sad song.  
  
So I think I gotta  
Gotta let it go  
I gotta let him go.  
Let it go, baby.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
Oh, yes it does, yes it does.  
  
I think I gotta  
Gotta let it go  
Mmmmmmm.  
Let it go, baby.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
  
Boy, whatcha want me to do? Can't stand up to you.  
No no no no.  
  
I try to take control of the love.  
It took control of me.  
See you lose all thought and sense of time.  
You have a change of mind.  
  
Taking the bumps and the bruises  
And all the pain of a two-time lose.  
Then I try to hold on. My faith is gone.  
It's just another sad song.  
  
I think I better  
Better let it go  
I better let him go.  
Let it go, baby.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
  
Yeah, I better  
Better let it go  
I gotta let him go.  
Let it go, Miss M.  
Another love, love TKO.  
  
Ooohhhh, boy you got me turned around and around and around.  
Around and around.  
Everybody's got to cry sometime.  
That's what they say. I heard them say.  
  
Everybody's gonna cry sometime.  
Mama says that they did, that they did.


I've got some records here  
To put you in the mood.  
The phone is off the hook  
So no one can intrude.  
I feel romantic  
And the record changes automatic, baby.  
Sweetheart, we hurried through the dinner  
And we hurried through the dance.  
We left before the picture show was through.  
Why did we hurry through the dinner  
And hurry through the dance?

The world is full of married men  
With wives who never understand.  
They're looking for someone to share  
The excitement of a love affair.  
  
And just as soon as they find you  
They'll wine you and dine you.  
Fly on the wings of romance.  
But in the eyes of the world  
You're just another girl  
Who loves a married man.

A love that will last 'til the end.  
But as he's driving away  
You know it's true what they say  
About a, a married man.  
  
They say they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it  
Again and again.  
Wooo, they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.  
These married men.  
  
Ah, he'll run when the scandal  
Gets too hot to handle.  
He'll say he just wants to be friends.  
And then he'll walk outta your life  
And go home to his wife  
'cause he's a married man.  
  
Oh, your love is a secret.  
You've got to sneak it  
Long as you can.  
Don't cry for your lover.

jingle bells upon a steel guitar  
thru the clouds we see the same bright star  
  
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say  
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day  
That's the island greeting that we send to you  
From the land where palm trees sway  
  
Here we know that Xmas will be green and bright  
Sun will shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way  
To say Merry Christmas to you.  


My baby jumped up this morning  
'N sat on the side of the bed  
He said, "I'm leaving you, baby"  
And this is just what I said  
I said, "I can't make you stay if you want to go  
But it's high time, baby, that you should know  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
So, if you still want to go, go ahead"  
And I mean every word I said  
  
My baby thought I was jivin'  
And he went right out the door  
He left me about three in the morning  
I got me a man at four  
Some women cry when their men bleed 'em  
Dry, long and slow  
But I found out somethin' a long time ago  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
So if he gets too big for his pants  
You better spring that new one and give him a chance  
  
I used to be chicken hearted  
Cry when he'd walk out the door  
'Cause I was just young and stupid  
Ha! Ain't like that no more  
'Cause I had a hard way to go  
But I learned the score  
And I'm here to tell you  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
Let him do anything he choose  
There's a million men who can fill his shoes  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
You can tell him I told you so  
  
"All right"


Walking along the beach last night  
Who do you think I spy?  
A girl with ebony fire eyes.  
Soft and low do she cry.  
Now what could be such a source of pain?  
I so boldly inquire.  
Pointing finger Havana way,  
These three words which transpire:  
  
She told me that only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami.  
My story, she goes this way.  
Fish may fly through the purple keys,  
Golden birds take to air.  
I am bound to the earth, it seems.  
My life can be so unfair.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
Standing on the shoreline waiting,  
Everyone anticipating.  
I can hear the broken hearted say,  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
And she cries for her child without a mother.  
And she cries for her son without a father.  
And she cries for herself without a lover.  
Can't face another day.  
Chase the blues away.  
I thought I heard her mumble as she  
Turned away  
  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
Standing on the shoreline waiting,  
Everyone anticipating.  
I can hear the broken hearted say,  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so,  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.


There is a land I know,  
Where lovers go, and flowers grow,  
Forever more.  
Where time is standing still,  
And lovers fill the quiet places,  
By the shore.  
  
We will cross the rainbow  
To a place where we'll be free,  
And he'll give his love to me.  
So I wait for the day,  
When he takes me away, to...  
  
Paradise.  
He'll take me by my hand.  
We'll walk along the sand.  
It's never-never land.  
Whoa-oo, whoa-oo, whoa.  
  
We'll build a castle there,  
Where we can share the happiness  
We've waited for.  
Where white flamingos fly,  
Away up high, and play above  
The ocean floor.  
  
We will climb a mountain  
To see our wonderland.  
Maybe now you'll understand  
Why I wait for the day,  
When he takes me away, to...  
  
Paradise.  
He'll take me by my hand.  
We'll walk along the sand.  
A never-never land.  
Whoa-oo, whoa-oo, whoa.  
  
I'll stand by him,  
Do right by him  
And I swear that I would die for him.  
Ohh, die for him.  
  
Paradise.  
He'll take me by my hand.  
We'll walk along the sand.  
It's never-never land.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
I'll stand by him,  
Do right by him.  
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand by him.  
Gonna do right, gonna do right by him.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.  
Oh, yeah...


Girl, we've got work to do  
Pass me the paint and glue  
Perfect isn't easy but it's me  
When one knows the world is watching  
One does what one must  
Some minor adjustments darling  
Not for my vanity but for humanity  
Each little step a pose  
See, how the breeding shows  
Sometimes, it's too much for even me  
When all of the world says yes  
Then, who am I to say no?  
Don't ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl  
No, girl, you need a pro  
Not a flea or a flaw, take a peek at that paw  
La, da-da, dee, dee, da  
Perfection becomes me, n'est ce pas?  
Unrivaled, unruffled I'm beauty unleashed  
(Yeah)  
Jaws drop, hearts stop, so classic and classy  
We're not talkin' Lassie  
La, ah, ooh, aroo  
Ruff, ruff ruff ruff ruff  
Ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-arow  
Though many covet my bone and bowl  
They're barkin' up the wrong tree  
You pretty pups all over the city  
I have your hearts and you have my pity  
Pretty is nice, but still, it's just pretty  
Perfect, my dear, is me  


Dear, I thought I'd drop a line.  
The weather's cool. The folks are fine.  
I'm in bed each night at nine.  
P.S. I love you.  
  
Yesterday we had some rain,  
but all in all I can't complain.  
Was it dusty on the train?  
P.S. I love you.  
  
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able.  
They came around to call.  
I burned a hole in the dining room table.  
And let me see, I guess that's all.  
  
Nothin' else for me to say,  
and so I'll close. Oh, by the way,  
everybody's thinkin' of you.  
P.S. I love you.  
  
I do my best to obey all your wishes.  
I put a sign up. Think  
now I got to buy us a new set of dishes,  
or wash the ones that have piled in the sink.  
  
Nothing else to tell you, dear.  
Except, each day feels like a year.  
Every night I'm dreamin' of you.  
P.S. I love you.  
P.S. I love you.


Honey, you are my shining star.  
Don't you go away.  
I wanna be right here where you are  
Until my dying day. Yes I do.  
  
So many have tried,  
Tried to find a love like yours and mine. Ohhh-whoa.  
But don't they realize how you hypnotize?  
Make me love you more each time. Ohhh-whoa.  
  
Honey, I'll never leave you lonely, yeah.  
Give my love to you only, yeah.  
To you only, to you only.  
  
Oh honey, you are my shining star.  
Don't you go away.  
Yeah, I wanna be right here where you are  
Until my dying day. Yeah.  
  
It feels so good  
When we're lying next to each other,  
Lost in love, lost in love,  
Drifting along on a cloud of love.  
  
Ooh, baby when we touch I love you so much.  
You're all I ever dreamed of. Ohhh-whoa.  
Hone, I'll never leave you lonely, yeah.  
Mmm, give my love to you only, yeah.  
To you only, to you only.  
  
Oh honey, you, you are, you are my shining star.  
Don't you go away, no.  
I wanna be right here where you are  
Until my dying day. Mmmm.  
  
It feels so good, it feels so good  
When we're lying here  
Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love.  
Oh baby, when we touch I love you so much.  
You, you're all I ever dreamed of.  
  
In spite of all we know, how little we know.  
In spite of all they say, how little we see.  
I only know, you and me together forever.  
You are my shining star, mmm, yes you are.  
Shine on, shine on. Keep on shining on.  
Shine on, shine on. Keep on shining on


There was a child named Bernadette.  
I heard the story long ago.  
She saw the queen of heaven once  
And kept the vision in her soul.  
  
No one believed what she had seen.  
No one believed what she heard,  
That there were sorrows to be healed  
And mercy, mercy in this world.  
  
So many hearts I find  
Broke like yours and mine,  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo.  
I just want to hold you.  
Come on, let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do.  
  
We've been around, we fall, we fly.  
We mostly fall, we mostly run.  
And every now and then we try  
To mend the damage that we've done.  
  
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest.  
I've got this joy here, here inside my breast.  
To think that I did not forget  
That child, that song of Bernadette.  
  
So many hearts I find,  
Hearts like yours and mine,  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo.  
Well, I just want to hold you.  
Come on, let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do.  
  
I just want to hold you.  
Won't you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do?


Where did you go when things went wrong, baby?  
Who did you run to?  
Find a shoulder to lay your head upon.  
Baby, wasn't I there?  
Didn't I take good care of you?  
But, oh, no. I can't believe you're leaving me, yeah.  
  
Stay with me, baby.  
I'm beggin' you to stay with me, baby.  
Yeah, stay with me, baby.  
I can't go on.  
  
Who did you touch when you needed tenderness, baby?  
I gave you so much,  
And in return I found happiness.  
Baby, what could I do?  
Maybe I was too good, too good to you.  
Oh, I can't believe you're leavin' me.  
Oh, oh, oh.  
  
Oh, stay with me, baby.  
Why don't you, why don't you just stay with me, baby?  
Yeah, stay with me, baby.  
Remember, you said you always gonna love me.  
Remember, you said you'd never ever leave me.  
Remember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you.  
Oh, oh, oh.  
  
Oh, stay with me, baby, baby, baby.  
Why don't you stay with me, baby?  
Stay with me, baby.  
I can't, I can't go, oh, on.  
  
"well, I'm a young woman, and I could get plenty of men. but honey, keepin'
'em's the hard part, ain't it? yeah. sometimes, sometimes I find I try so
hard."  
Maybe this time I should be the one to go away.  
'cause honey, ain't it my turn to have somebody  
Grab hold of me and say,  
"no! don't go! you can't go!"  
  
Oh! stay, stay with me, baby.  
I'm begging you, stay with me.  
Stay with me, baby.  
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, stay with me, baby.  
Why don't you stay with me, baby?  
Stay with me, baby.  
I can't, I can't go on.


Daybreak.  
How can I ever leave this place beside you?  
You were the only one I ever cried to.  
The night is through.  
  
Now it's heartache.  
I got to get home before he sees it's daybreak.  
Light from the sky is shining through the curtain lace.  
I never really meant to stay.  
  
And now it's daybreak.  
We were just sitting and talking.  
Oh, who would have thought we'd be spending the night  
Dreading the light of daybreak?  
  
How can I leave this place beside you?  
How can I leave you, baby, leave you?  
I don't want to go.  
  
And now it's daybreak.  
We were like storybook children.  
Hey, but, like all good fairy tales, this one must end.  
Here is the end. It's daybreak.  
  
How can I ever leave this place beside you?  
You were the only one I ever cried to.  
The night is through.  
  
Lord knows it's daybreak.  
And it feels like heartbreak.  
I don't want to leave you,  
I don't want to leave you, I need you!  
Looks like it's daybreak,  
But it feels like it's heartache.  
I don't want to leave you,  
Don't make me leave you, I need you!  
Daybreak.  
Sunlight shining through the lace.  
I need you.  
Sun is smiling on your face.  
I need you.  
Don't make me leave you!  
Lord!


Twas a hot afternoon, the last day of June  
And the sun was a demon  
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade  
And the pavements were steaming  
  
I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet  
I needed time for some thinking  
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye  
And I swore it was winkin'  
  
She was thirty-one and I was seventeen  
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything  
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing  
And wondered what the coming night would bring  
  
The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky  
And it started to swelter  
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown  
And I thought it would melt her  
  
She threw back her hair like I wasn't there  
And she sipped on a Julep  
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare  
When I looked at her two lips  
  
And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say  
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say  
But stay with me until the sun has gone away  
And I will chase the boy in you away  
  
And then she smiled and we talked for a while  
Then we walked for a mile to the sea  
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand  
But I saw the sunrise as a man  
  
Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye  
But the memory lingers  
I go back in my mind to the very first time  
And feel the touch of her fingers


The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly.  
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly.  
Then you and I came wandering by,  
And lost in a sigh were we.  
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly.  
  
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly.  
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside.  
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly.  
  
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside.  
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly.


Many men with lofty aims strive for lofty goals.  
Others play at smaller games, being simpler souls.  
I am of the latter brand. All I want to do  
Is to find a spot of land and live there with you.  
  
Someday we'll build a home  
On a hilltop high, you and I,  
Shiny and new, a cottage that two can fill.  
And we'll be pleased to be called  
"The folks who live on the hill."  
  
Someday we may be adding  
A thing or two, a wing or two.  
We will make changes as any family will.  
But we will always be called  
"The folks who live on the hill."  
  
Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,  
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.  
And when the kids grow up and leave us,  
We'll sit and look at the same old view, just we two.  
  
Darby and Joan who, used to be Jack and Jill,  
The folks like to be called  
What they have always been called,  
"The folks who live on the hill."


I'll bet you think you can just use her the way  
You used to do. I've got news for you.  
Your fuse is out. The girl is on to you.  
  
I'll bet you think you can abuse her and say  
You love her too. I remember pain  
You put her through.  
But the girl is on to you.  
  
She's grown much wiser than you realize.  
She will surprise you.  
No more paying for your lies.  
  
And I'll bet you think you can confuse her. But, hey,  
The loser is you. She sees through your eyes.  
You'll soon surmise.  
The girl is on to you.  
  
She's grown much wiser than you realize.  
She will surprise you.  
No more paying for your lies.  
  
Oh, and I'll bet you think  
You can confuse her, but, hey,  
The loser is you. She sees through your eyes.  
You'll soon surmise. The girl is on to you.  
  
She sees through your eyes.  
You'll soon surmise.  
The girl is on to you.  
  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
Oooh. The girl is on to you.  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
Now she's gone, she's gone, she's gone. Oooh.  
  
I'll bet you think  
She'll come running back to you,  
Just like she used to do.  
But the girl is awful strong.  
That's why the girl is gone, gone, gone, gone,  
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.


"This is a song I've been singing for a long time.  
It's like an old friend.  
But, you know, I think it,  
It's only recently that I discovered what it's really about."  
  
You've got to give a little, take a little,  
And let your poor heart break a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
  
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,  
Until the clouds roll by a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
  
As long as there's the two of us,  
We've got the world and all it's charms.  
And when the world is through with us,  
We've got each other's arms.  
  
You've got to win a little, lose a little,  
Yes, and always have the blues a little.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.


Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
I have no guts, I have no pride  
My heart is weak, my love is blind  
When your game is up, I'll still be by your side  
If you love me at all, let this be the last time  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
You hurt me so much, but I love you forever  
'Cause when you tear me up, you always put me back together  
Ever so gently, ever so gently  
Baby, let this be the last time, yeah  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
I bite my lip and hold my head up high  
I try my best not to let you see me cry  
I can take a joke and you can be unkind  
If you love me at all, let this be the last time  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
You hurt me so much but I love you forever  
'Cause when you tear me up, you always put me back together  
Ever so gently, ever so gently  
Baby, let this be the last time, yeah  
You hurt me so much but I love you forever  
'Cause when you tear me up, you always put me back together  
Ever so gently, ever so gently  
Baby, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
...  


Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed  
Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need  
I say love, it is a flower, and you, it's only seed  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who can not seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose.


Wherever we go, whatever we do  
We're gonna go through it together  
We may not go far, but sure as a star  
Wherever we are, it's together  
Wherever I go, I know he goes  
Wherever I go, I know she goes  
No fits, no fights, no feuds and no egos  
Amigos, together!  
Through thick and through thin, all out or all in  
And whether it's win, place or show  
With you for me and me for you  
We'll muddle through whatever we do  
Together, wherever we go  
Wherever we go, whatever we do  
We're gonna go through it together  
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep  
We'll always sleep cheaper together  
Whatever the boat I row, you row, a duo  
Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe, a trio  
And any I. O. U., I owe you, oh's?  
Who, me-oh? No, you-oh  
No, we-oh, together!  
We all take the bow, including the cow  
Though business is lousy and slow  
With Herbie's vim, Louise's verve  
Now all we need is someone with nerve  
Together, together, wherever, wherever  
Together, wherever, together, wherever we go  
We go in a group, we tour in a troupe  
We land in the soup, but we know  
The things we do, we do by threes, a perfect team  
No, this way, Louise!  
Together, together, wherever, wherever  
Together, wherever we go!  


Wind storm, comes the sound.  
From the stars my dark has come.  
You've gone from me.  
Whoa, tragedy.  
Mmm, tragedy.  
  
Whoa, come back. Help me here.  
Call me my love, love. Be sincere.  
You've gone, you've gone,  
you've gone from me.  
Whoa, tragedy.  
Whoa, tragedy.  
  
Like smoke from a fire of love, love, love.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh.  
Our dreams have all gone.  
A fire. Ooo-oo-oo-ooh.  
  
Blown by wind, kissed by snow.  
All that's left is the dark.  
We know you've gone from me.  
Whoa-oo-oo-oo-o-o-hy?  
Tragedy.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


When the bells all ring and the horns all blow  
And the couples we know are fondly kissing  
Will I be with you  
Or will I be among the missing?  
  
Maybe it's much too early in the game  
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?  
  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night?  
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve  
  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose, I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of a thousand invitations you'll receive  
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance  
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?  
  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose, I'd ever be the one you chose

What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?


The sun is shining, the grass is green,  
The orange and palm trees sway.  
There's never been such a day  
In Beverly Hills, L.A.  
  
But it's December the twenty fourth,  
And I am longing to be up north.  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,  
Just like the ones I used to know.  
Where the treetops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,  
With every Christmas card I write.  
May your days be merry and bright,  
And may all your Christmases be white.  
  
May your days be merry and bright,  
And may all your Christmases,  
All your Christmases,  
All your Christmases be white.


Looking out at the people looking in  
Feeling good must be some kind of sin  
Looking in at the people looking out  
Feeling guilty, scared to move about  
  
Looking up at the people looking down  
Taking tranquilizers by the pound  
Looking down at the people looking up  
Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough  
  
Ah, but that green grass on the other side  
Is just an illusion  
We all have our own confusion  
  
Rich people watching the people poor  
Trying to figure out how to get some more  
Poor people watching people rich  
You know, they call them dirty you-know-which  
  
Ugly people watching the people pretty  
Say they can't get down to the nitty-gritty  
Pretty people watching people ugly  
Say I sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me  
  
Ah, but that green grass on the other side  
Is just an illusion  
We all have our own confusion


Hello like before  
I'd never come here  
If I'd known that you were here  
I must admit though  
That's it's nice to see you, dear  
You look like you've been doing well  
  
Hello like before  
I hope we've grown  
'Cause we were only children then  
For laughs I guess we both can say  
'I knew when'  
But then again, that's kiss and tell  
  
Hello like before  
I guess it's different  
'Cause we know each other now  
I guess I've always known  
We'd meet again somehow  
So that it might as well be now

I don't want you on my mind all the time  
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness  
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'  
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness  
Every dream about you  
I just wake up knowing that I've got to do without you  
  
I don't want all the time doin' up my mind  
I don't want you on my mind all the time

I want to spend the night  
With you  
Forever  
  
Every time we wind up spending the night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
I want to share my life  
With you  
Forever  
  
Ever time we wind sharing a night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
And when I stay away from you  
I never get to sleep  
I try to hug my pillow  
And pretend that you're with me  
But I can't feel it  
  
Then when we are together  
It's right there for me to see  
I can't keep looking at loneliness  
And trying to call it freedom  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
I want to spend the night  
With you  
Forever  
  
Every time we wind up spending the night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
[Repeat x6]  
Do you ever want to spend the night?


Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
Yeah thump a thumping in my head  
  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
I close my eyes and see a pretty city  
With a million flowers babe  
  
Now I can hear the angels sing  
Songs that only angels sing  
She's such a pretty thing  
That I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
Feel the blood a pumping in my veins  
Whoa now

She's such a tender sender  
With her sweet young friends  
  
She's so good at what she does  
All she wants to do is kiss and hug  
She's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
[Repeat x8]  
Put your foot on the rock and pat your foot,  
Don't stop, put your foot on the rock  
  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
Feel the blood a pumping in my veins  
Whoa now  
When I'm kissing my love  
She's such a tender sender  
With her sweet young friends  
  
Whoa now  
  
She's so good at what she does  
All she wants to do is kiss and hug  
She's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love


La, la, la, la, la.  
I only want to love you, please don't push me away,  
Let me in your life.  
I wasn't there when he hurt you, so why should I  
Have to pay, let me in your life.  
I want to share your tomorrows, so I must beg you  
Today, if he's the cause of your sorrows, be glad  
That he's gone away.  
I need someone, let me love you, please don't push  
Me away, Let me in your life.  
La, la, la, la, la.  


I love the story in your love song  
Building them castles in your mind  
Come down here looking for a feeling  
Someday I know you're gonna find  
  
I wanna lay down there beside you  
But first we ought to take some time  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna feel good just like you do  
(Feel good) I haven't  
Loved in quite some time  
(Feel good) I had some  
Phases that I been through  
Where I've just loved and left behind  
  
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty  
I don't wanna be unkind  
But before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna make love to your mind  
I wanna make love to your mind  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna feel good just like you do  
I haven't loved in quite some time  
Lord, I had some funny phases  
That I been through, no, no  
Where I've just loved and left behind  
  
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty  
I don't really wanna be unkind  
But before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
(To your mind, to your mind)  
(To your mind, to your mind)  
(To your mind)  
  
I love the story in your love song  
Building them castles in your mind  
Come down here from somewhere  
Looking for a feeling  
Someday I know you're gonna find  
  
See, I wanna lay down there beside you  
But first we ought to take some time (time)  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
To your mind  
(I wanna make love) to your mind  
To your mind  
(I wanna make love) to your mind  
(I wanna make love to your mind)...


Your love is like a a chunk of gold  
Hard to gain, and hard to hold  
  
Like a rose that's soft to touch  
Love has gone, and it hurts so much  
  
Well and Why  
Must the same love that made me laugh  
Make me cry?  
  
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain  
Think of it as being a great big rock  
Won't you think before you started to roll it down  
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop  
  
I've given all I have to give  
And if you don't want me  
I don't want to live  
  
Well and Why  
Must the same love that made me laugh  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
  
Why you want to make me lay in my pillow  
Just cryin' like a weeping willow  
  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
  
Why you want to make me mess in my pillow  
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow  
  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?  
Why you want to make me cry?


A fine romance, with no kisses  
A fine romance, my friend this is  
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes  
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes  
A fine romance, you won't nestle  
A fine romance, you won't wrestle  
I might as well play bridge  
With my old maid aunt  
I haven't got a chance  
This is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, my good fellow  
You take romance, I'll take jello  
You're calmer than the seals  
In the Arctic Ocean  
At least they flap their fins  
To express emotion  
A fine romance with no quarrels  
With no insults and all morals  
I've never mussed the crease  
In your blue serge pants  
I never get the chance  
This is a fine romance


All or nothing at all  
Half love never appealed to me  
If your heart never could yield to me  
Then I'd rather have nothing at all  
  
All or nothing at all  
If it's love there is no in between  
Why begin, then cry for something that might have been  
No, I rather have nothing at all  
But, please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek  
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall  
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak  
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall  
And if I fell under the spell of your call  
I would be caught in the undertow  
So, you see, I've got to say  
No, no  
All or nothing at all


When somebody loves you  
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way  
Happy to be near you  
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way  
  
Taller than the tallest tree is  
That's how it's got to feel  
Deeper than the deep blue see is  
That's how deep it goes, if its real  
  
When somebody needs you  
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way  
Through the good or lean years  
And for all the in between years, come what may  
  
Who know where the road will lead us  
Only a fool would say  
But if you'll let me love you  
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way, all the way


I'll be loving you always  
With a love that's true always  
When the things you plan  
Need a helping hand will understand  
Always, always  
Days may not be fair always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour  
Not for just a day  
Not for just a year, but always  
  
I'll be loving you always  
With a love that's true always  
When the things you plan  
Need a helping hand will understand  
Always, always  
Days may not be fair always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour  
Not for just a day  
Not for just a year, but always


It was a morning, long before dawn  
Without a warning I found he was gone  
How could he do it  
Why should he do it  
He never done it before  
  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
Ain't these tears, in these eyes telling you  
How can you ask me "am I blue"  
Why, wouldn't you be too  
If each plan  
With your man  
Done fell through  
  
There was a time  
When I was his only one  
But now I'm  
The sad and lonely one, lonely  
  
Was I gay  
Until today  
Now he's gone, and we're through  
Am I blue


There's snowflakes in the sky  
And geese are flying high  
But it's April in my heart again  
The devil got his due  
Love's holiday is through  
Love and I have made a happy start again  
Through leaves lie on the ground  
The world just turned around  
It isn't Fall at all you see  
It's Spring that I have found  
  
There's frost in Central Park  
At five it's almost dark  
What's the difference  
When you've heard love's sweet amend  
There's snowflakes in the sky  
And geese are flying high  
But there's April in my heart again


Leonard feather  
  
Well good morning baby, welcome back to town  
How do, fine papa, welcome back to town  
You're doing so much travelling never know  
When you'll be around  
You're a fine and mellow fella  
But you're stubborn as a mule  
You love me like an angel  
But you treat me like a fool  
Two-faced daddy don't hand me no doublecross  
You'll see any time I'm ready  
I can tell you baby get lost  
You're cheating on the outside  
Doing anything you choose  
You better come back on the inside  
'cause you got too much to lose  
Don't want no trouble I've got to be the boss  
And if you can't play it my way  
Well now baby get lost  
I try to stop your cheating  
But I just don't have the time  
'cause I got so many men that  
They're standing right in line  
Keep cool papa, you got to come across  
'cause any time I'm ready, yes any time I'm ready  
You know when I'm ready  
I can tell you baby get lost  
Why don't you get lost  


So you cry  
What's it about, baby?  
You ask why  
Blues had to go and pick you  
So you go  
Down to the shore, kid's stuff  
Don't you know  
There's honey in the store for you, big stuff  
Let's take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
  
So you stare  
Call it despair, baby  
Don't you care  
I'm on the square about you  
Let's have a try  
It maybe that you're my guy  
Let's take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
Come in from out of the rain


Billie Holiday  
  
Lord I love my man, tell the world I do  
I love my man, tell the world I do  
But when he mistreats me  
Makes me feel so blue  
  
My man wouldn't give me no breakfast  
Wouldn't give me no dinner  
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors  
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes  
I didn't have so many  
But I had a long, long way to go  
  
Some men like me talkin' happy  
Some calls it snappy  
Some call me honey  
Others think I got money  
Some tell me baby you're built for speed  
Now if you put that all together  
Makes me everthing a good man needs


Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
And to reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Dance with me, I want my arms about you  
The charm about you  
Will carry me through  
To heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
And to reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Dance with me, I want my arms about you  
The charm about you  
Will carry me through  
To heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek


I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain and deep as a river come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me it was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me come rain or come shine  
Happy together unhappy together and won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
  
But I'm with you always, I'm with you rain or shine  
  
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain deep as a river come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me it was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me come rain or come shine  
Happy together unhappy together and won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money.  
  
But I'll love you always, I'm with you rain or shine  
  
Rain or shine.


Comes rain, put your rubber on your feed  
Comes a snow, you can get a little heat  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a fire, you know what to do  
Blow a tire, buy another shoe  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Don't try hiding, cause there isn't any use  
You start sliding when you're heart turns on the juice  
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day  
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore  
Comes the, you can hide behind the door  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes the measles,  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
That all brother, if you've ever bin in love  
That all brother, you know where I'm speaking of  
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake  
Comes depression, you may get another break  
Comes love, nothing can be done


Wesley 'Sox' Wilson  
If I call three times a day  
Come and drive my blues away  
When you come, be ready to play  
Do your duty  
  
If you want to have some love  
Give your baby your last buck  
Don't come quackin' like a duck  
Do your duty  
  
I heard you say you didn't love me  
Numb as Mrs. Brown  
I don't believe a word they say  
She's the lyinest woman in town  
  
When I need attention at home  
I'll call you on the phone  
Come yourself, don't send your friend Jones  
Do your duty  
  
If my radiator get too hot  
Cool it off in lots of spots  
Give me all the service you've got  
Do your duty  
  
If you don't know what it's all about  
Don't sit around my house and pout  
If you do you'll catch your mama tippin' now  
Do your duty  
  
If you make your own bed hard  
That's the way o' life  
I'm tired of sleepin' by myself  
But you too dumb to realize  
  
I'm not tryin' to make you feel blue  
I'm not satisfied with the way you do  
I've got to help you find somebody too  
Do your duty


Embrace me  
My sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me  
My irreplaceable you  
Just to look at you  
My heart grows tipsy in me  
You and you alone  
  
Bring out the gypsy in me  
  
I love all  
The many charms about you  
Above all  
I want my arms about you  
Don't be naughty baby  
Come to me  
Come to me do  
My sweet embraceable you  
  
I love all  
The many charms about you  
Above all  
I want my arms about you  
Don't be naughty baby  
Come to me  
Come to me do  
My sweet embraceable you


Everybody's laughing  
Yes everybody's laughing  
They know that you and I are through  
And everybody's laughing  
  
I told the world you loved me  
And bragged about it proudly  
But since they know it's over  
They're laughing at me loudly.  
  
People love to linger  
So they can point a finger  
And tear apart a gal whose heart  
Was taken through the wringer  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybody's laughing  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybody's laughing


Always blue all in a mist  
It's plain as can be  
You're so mean to me  
But everything happens for the best  
You always play around  
You're running my heart so deep in the ground  
That O.K. everything happens for the best  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best  
  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best


Black cats creep across my path  
Until I'm almost mad  
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath  
'Cause all my luck is bad  
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains  
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains  
I guess I'll go through life kust catching colds and missin' trains  
  
Everything happens to me  
I never miss a thing  
I've had the measles and the mumps  
And every time I play an ace  
My partner always trumps  
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps  
  
Everything happens to me  
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me  
that love would turn the trick to end despair  
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me  
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air  
I've telegraphed and phoned  
I send an 'Airmail Special' too  
Your answer was 'Goodbye'  
And there was even postage due  
I fell in love just once  
And then it had to be with you  
  
Everything happens to me


Everything I have is yours  
You are part of me  
Everything I have is yours  
My destiny  
  
I would gladly give the sun to you  
If the sun were only mine  
I would gladly give the earth to you  
And the stars that shine  
Everything that I posses  
I offer you  
  
Let my dream of happiness  
Come through  
I'll be happy just to spent my life  
Waiting at your backend call  
Everything I have is yours  
My life  
My all  
  
Everything I have is yours  
You are part of me  
Everything I have is yours  
My destiny  
  
I would gladly give the sun to you  
If the sun were only mine  
I would gladly give the earth to you  
And the stars that shine  
Everything that I posses  
I offer to you  
  
Let my dream of happiness  
Come through  
I'll be happy just to spent my life  
Waiting at your backend call  
Everything I have is yours  
My life  
My all


Always blue all in a mist  
It's plain as can be  
You're so mean to me  
But everything happens for the best  
You always play around  
You're running my heart so deep in the ground  
That O.K. everything happens for the best  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best  
  
I loved you so madly

Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best  
Failing in love again  
Never wanted to  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it  
  
Love's always been my game  
Play it as I may  
I was born that way  
Can't help it  
  
Men flock around me  
Like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn  
I know I'm not to blame  
  
I'm falling  
Can't help it


All, you old-time queens, from New Orleans, who lived in Storyville  
You sang the blues, try to amuse, here's how they pay the bill  
The law step-in and call it sin to have a little fun  
The police car has made a stop and Storyville is done  
  
Pick out your steamboat, pick yourself a train  
A slo-ow train  
Pick out your steamboat, pick yourself a train  
A slo-ow train  
They made you close-up they'll never let you back  
Won't let you back  
Go buy your ticket or else you walk the track  
  
No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain  
The cold-old rain  
No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain  
The cold-old rain  
Just say farewell now and get your one last thrill  
Your one last thrill  
Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville  
  
No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain  
The cold-old rain  
Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville  
  
Just say farewell now and get your one last thrill  
Your one last thrill  
Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville


I try to keep you out of my heart  
But somehow I find  
Trying to keep you out of my heart  
I'm out of my mind  
I tell myself "I'm through with you  
And I'll having nothing more to do with you"  
I stay away, but every day  
I'm just foolin myself  
  
Tell my friends that I don't care  
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair  
But all know it isn't so  
I'm just foolin myself  
  
And every time I pass  
And see my face in a looking glass  
I tip my hat and say  
"How do you do, you fool  
You're trowing your life away"  
I'm acting gay  
I'm acting proud  
And every time I see you in a crowd  
I may pretend  
But in the end  
I'm just fooling myself


Sweetheart, the night is growing old  
Sweetheart, my love is still untold  
A kiss that is never tasted  
Forever and ever is wasted  
  
For all we know, we may never meet again  
Before you go, make this moment sweet again  
We won't say, goodnight until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know this may only be a dream  
We come and go like a ripple on a stream  
So love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come, for all we know


Forget if you can  
Romantic music one magical night  
A corner table in dim candle light  
A kiss that was heaven for two  
  
Forget if you can  
The day we hiked to where nobody knows  
The swell spaghetti at Tony and Joe's  
It hasn't been fun without you  
  
Don't you remember  
All the silly things we used to do  
The way we laughed  
When we were photographed  
As Handsome Hat and his ten-timing gal  
Why shouldn't we play  
More happy moments like we used to spend  
They were so perfect  
Too perfect to end  
Let your heart forget it you can


What makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
There's nothing in the world  
Too good for a girl that's good and true  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car  
And everything  
It's love that makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
  
What makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
There's nothing in the world  
Too good for a guy that's good and true  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car  
And everything  
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
  
What makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
There's nothing in the world  
Too good for a girl that's good and true  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
Big Cadillac car  
And everything  
It's love that makes me treat you the way that I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you

Up in harlem every saturday night  
Where the highbrows get together  
It's just too right  
They all congregate and all night hop  
And what they do is ooh boppa dap  
Ole hanna brown from way across town  
Gets full of corn and starts  
Bringing them down  
And at the break of day  
You can hear ole hanna say  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me a gate I don't care  
Feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because he's bringing me down  
He's got rhythm yeah, when he stamps his feet  
He sends me right off to sleep  
Cheek all your razors and all your guns  
We're gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me cause I don't care  
  
I want a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Send me daddy move right in  
I feel just like I wanna shout  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because he's knocking me out  
He's got rhythm when he stamps his feet  
He moves me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and your guns  
  
Do the hueklebuck until the rising sun  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Move me, 'cause I'm in my sin  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer


Girls were made to take care of boys  
To be kind and dutiful  
Hmm  
Girls were made to take care of boys  
Made to share their sorrows  
Made to share their joys  
Made to help and guide them  
With ever a patient hand  
  
Made to give affection  
In the right direction  
(Always understand)  
  
Now boys may think they take care of girls  
Just because they pass on their fashions and their curls  
But I've always found  
It's just the other way around  
(Other way around)  
  
If you need the girl  
And declare you do  
(Tell her that you need her)  
She'll be there  
To take care of you  
(She'll be there)  
(Now boys may think they take care of girls  
Just because they're clever with their fashions and their curls)  
But I've always found  
It's just the other way around


Sunday is gloomy,  
My hours are slumberless.  
Dearest, the shadows  
I live with are numberless.  
  
Little white flowers  
Will never awaken you.  
Not where the black coach  
Of sorrow has taken you.  
  
Angels have no thought  
Of ever returning you.  
Would they be angry  
If I thought of joining you?  
  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Gloomy is Sunday,  
With shadows I spend it all.  
My heart and I, have  
Decided to end it all.  
  
Soon there'll be candles  
And prayers that are said, I know.  
Let them not weep,  
Let them know that I'm glad to go.  
  
Death is no dream,  
For in death I'm caressing you.  
With the last breath of my soul,  
I'll be blessin' you.  
  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Dreaming, I was only dreaming.  
I wake and I find you asleep  
In the deep of my heart, dear.  
  
Darling, I hope that  
My dream never haunted you.  
My heart is telling you,  
How much I wanted you.  
  
Gloomy Sunday


Them that's got shall have  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible said and it still is news  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Yes, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
When you're gone, spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Rich relations give  
Crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
He just worry 'bout nothin'  
Cause he's got his own  
Yes he's got his own


Gone with the wind  
Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
now all is gone  
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that thrilled my heart  
just like a flame love burned brightly  
Then became an empty smoke dream  
That has gone with the wind  
  


Just when romance got a start  
You decided it was time to part  
How could you?  
How could you?  
  
It was on a night like this  
You left me and didn't leave a kiss  
How could you?  
How could you?  
  
You know that love is just like apple pie  
It's either sweet or tart  
You could be the apple of my eye  
But you, you, you upset the apple cart  
  
I was looking forward to  
All those little things you didn't do  
How could you,  
Could you break my heart?


Away from the city that hurts and knocks,  
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks  
In the still and the chill of the night  
I see the horizon the great unknown  
My heart has an ache  
It's as heavy as stone  
With the dawn coming on, make it last  
  
I cover the waterfront  
I'm watching the sea  
Will the one I love  
Be coming back to me  
  
I cover the waterfront  
In search of my love  
An I'm covered  
By a starlit sky above  
  
Here am I  
Patiently waiting  
Hoping and longing  
Oh how I yearn  
Where are you  
Have you thought back time  
Will you remember  
Will you return  
  
Will the one I love  
Be coming back  
To me


I get along without you very well  
Of course, I do  
Except when soft rains fall  
And drip from leaves  
Then I recall  
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms  
Of course, I do  
But I get along without you very well  
  
I've forgotten you just like I should  
Of course, I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someone's laugh that is the same  
But I've forgotten you just like I should  
  
What a guy  
What a fool am I  
To think my breaking heart  
Could kid the moon  
What's in store  
Should I fall once more  
No, it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course, I do  
Except perhaps in Spring  
But I should never think of Spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two  
  
What's in store  
Should I fall once more  
No, it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course, I do  
Except perhaps in Spring  
But I should never think of Spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two


If my heart could only talk  
Heaven would be mine  
If my heart could only talk  
Life would be divine  
You would hear my song of love so tender  
It would thrill you until you willingly surrender  
  
If my heart could only talk  
Dreams would all come true  
'Neath the starlight I would walk  
Hand in hand with you  
I would have to seek your lips  
Thrill you to your fingertips  
If my heart could only talk  
  
If my heart could only talk  
Dreams would all come true  
'Neath the starlight I would walk  
Hand in hand with you  
I would have to seek your lips  
Thrill you to your fingertips  
If my heart could only talk


I'll be seeing you  
In all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces  
All day and through  
In that small cafe  
The park across the way  
The children carrousel  
The chestnut trees  
The wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you


I'll never be the same  
Guys have lost their meaning for me  
I'll never be the same  
Nothing's what it once used to be  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring, I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
I'll never be the same since we're apart  
But there's a lot that a smile can hide  
And I know deep down inside  
I'll never be the same, never be the same again  


One dark and stormy night  
Big John was feeling blue  
Ain't he didn't seem right  
So he didn't know just what to do  
I said do please tell me  
Ain't you satisfied?  
He looked around so pitiful  
And to me he replied  
Keeps on raining  
Look how it's raining  
Daddy he can't make no time  
Wind keeps blowing  
Howl wind's blowing  
  
Soon I'll find  
In the winter time  
When it starts to snow  
I know, Billy  
You've got to have some dough  
Keeps on raining  
Look how it's raining  
Daddy he can't make no time  
  
Ain't the rain just beautiful  
Some people say  
But I'd rather see it  
In a fine movie place  
Keeps on raining  
Look how it's raining  
Your daddy he can't make no time  
No daddy he can't make no time


Don't mind the rain drops  
Wait till the rain stops  
Smile through your tears, laughing at life  
No road is lonely, if you will only  
Lose all your blues laughing at life  
Live for tomorrow, be happy today  
Laugh all your sorrows away  
Start now and cheer up  
The skies will clear up  
Lose all your blues laughing at life  
  
Don't mind the rain drops  
Wait till the rain stops  
You'll find the sun laughing at life  
No road is lonely, if you will only  
Smile through your tears, laugh at life  
Live for tomorrow, be happy today  
Laugh all your sorrows away  
Start now and cheer up  
The skies will clear up  
Lose all your blues laughing at life


This suspense is killin' me  
I can't stand uncertainty  
Tell me now I've got to know  
Whether you want me to stay or go  
  
Love me or leave me  
Or let me be lonely  
You won't believe me, I love you only  
I'd rather be lonely  
Than happy with somebody else  
  
You might find the night time  
The right time for kissin'  
But night time is my time  
For just reminiscin'  
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'  
With somebody else  
  
There'll be no one  
Unless that someone is you  
I intend to be independently blue  
I want your love  
But I don't want to borrow  
To have it today to give back tomorrow  
For your love is my love  
There's no love for nobody else


Me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you  
We all think you're wonderful  
We do  
  
Me, myself and I  
Have just one point of view  
We're convinced  
There's no one else like you  
It can't be denied dear  
You brought the sun to us  
We'd be satisfied dear  
If you, you'd belong to one of us  
  
So if you pass me by  
Three hearts will break in two  
Cause me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you  
  
Me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you  
We all think you're wonderful  
We do  
  
Me, myself and I  
Have just one point of view  
We're convinced  
There's no one else like you  
  
It can't be denied dear  
You brought the sun to us  
We'd be satisfied dear  
If you'd belong to one of us  
  
So if you pass me by  
Three hearts will break in two  
Cause me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you


Whether you are here or yonder,  
Whether you are false or true  
Whether you remain or wander,  
I'm growing fonder of you  
Even though your friends forsake you,  
Even though you don't succeed  
Wouldn't I be glad to take you,  
Give you the break you need  
  
More than you know, more than you know  
Girl of my heart, I love you so  
Lately I find you're on my mind  
More than you know  
  
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong  
Girl of my heart, I'll string along  
You need me so  
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)  
Loving you the way that I do  
  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Loving may be all you can give  
But baby I can't live without it  
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry  
If you got tired and said "Good-bye"  
  
More than I'd show  
More than you'd ever know


My first impression of you  
Was like the sight of flowers in spring  
You were a glorious thing to see  
  
My first impression of you  
Was something indescribably new  
I stood there looking at you  
Smiling at me  
  
If you had stepped right out of heaven  
It wouldn't surprise me more  
I thought you were an angel  
From heaven's door  
  
It may sound silly, but true  
My heart just stopped  
When I caught your eye  
So overwhelming  
Was my first impression of you


Once they called it ragtime  
And it had its fling  
It's the same old syncopation  
Now they call it swing  
  
Then they played it jazz time  
To a buck-and-wing  
Once again it sweeped the nation  
Now they call it swing  
  
When singers used to sing  
They would go hot cha  
But with this modern thing  
Now they go dru-do do, dra-da-da  
  
Rhythm has its seasons  
Summer, fall and spring  
But for seven silly reasons  
Someone pulled the string  
And they started dancing  
Now they call it swing


If you wonder why I'm near you  
Even though I've been denied  
I'm inclined to be a little  
On the sentimental side  
I suppose I should forget you  
If I had an ounce of pride  
But I guess I can't help being  
On the sentimental side  
I should act gay  
Laugh it off and say, farewell  
Say it just didn't wear well  
But I'm not that way  
I'm in hopes you'll think it over  
And perhaps be satisfied  
With a simple sort of person  
On the sentimental side  
  
I should act gay  
Laugh it off and say, farewell  
Say it just didn't wear well  
But I'm not that way  
I'm in hopes you'll think it over  
And perhaps be satisfied  
With a simple sort of person  
On the sentimental side


One never knows, does one?  
When love will come along  
Then so suddenly life turns out to be a song  
  
One never knows, does one?  
The moment or the place  
Then right before your eyes  
Someone occupies your embrace  
  
Someday look and you'll find  
Two hearts were blest  
Someday fate may be kind  
Pray for the future  
Hope for the best  
One never knows, does one?  
  
That's just the way it goes  
All at once you hear  
"Hold me. Caress me"  
And then love may come  
But when, one never knows


If you hear  
A song in blue  
Like a flower crying  
For the dew  
That was my heart serenading you  
My prelude to a kiss  
  
If you hear a song that grows  
From my tender sentimental woes  
That was my heart trying to compose  
A prelude to a kiss  
  
Though it's just a simple melody  
With nothing fancy  
Nothing much  
You could turn it to a symphony  
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch  
  
Oh how my love song gently cries  
For the tenderness within your eyes  
My love is a prelude that never dies  
A prelude to a kiss  
  
Though it's just a simple melody  
With nothing fancy  
Nothing much  
You could turn it to a symphony  
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch  
  
Oh how my love song so gently cries  
For the tenderness within your eyes  
My love is a prelude that never dies  
A prelude to a kiss


You got to open your eyes in the morning  
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'  
And you gotta get ready to go  
You say you went out late last evenin'  
Did a lot of drinkin'  
Come home stinkin'  
And you went and fell asleep on the floor  
And then your lady comes and finds you asleepin'  
Starts in to weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'  
And you better get your ass out the door  
  
Ain't no crime  
Say everybody gets that way some time  
Ain't no crime  
You know it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind  
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh.  
  
You got to open your eyes in the morning  
Nine o'clock comin' with out any warnin'  
And you gotta get ready to go  
Well now you tell me you love somebody  
And you'll love 'em forever  
You may love 'em forever  
But you won't like 'em all of the time  
Well now you tell me you need somebody for the rest of your life  
You might have somebody  
But you won't want 'em everyday  
  
Ain't no crime  
Say ev'rybody gets that way some time  
Ain't no crime  
Well it's just human nature  
Happens all the time  
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh  
  
And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'  
The grass keeps growin'  
You gotta keep goin'  
And the Lord have mercy on your soul  
La, la la la.


She stood on the tracks  
Waving her arms  
Leading me to that third rail SHOCK  
Quick as a wink  
She changed her mind.  
She gave me a night  
That's all it was  
What will it take until I STOP  
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna  
There?s nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna  
We laid on the beach  
Watching the tide  
She didn't tell me there were ROCKS  
Under the waves  
Right off the shore.  
Washed up on the sand  
Barely alive  
Wishing the undertow would STOP  
How can a man take anymore, whoa  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna.  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna.  
There's nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna.  
I'm failing in school  
Losing my friends  
Making my family lose their minds  
I don't want to eat  
I don't want to sleep  
I only want Leyna, one more time.  
Now, I'm in my room  
Watching the tube  
Telling myself, she still may DROP  
Over to say, she's changed her mind  
So, I wait in the dark  
Listening for her  
Instead of hearing my old man saying STOP  
Kidding yourself, wasting your time.  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna  
There's nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna  
  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna


There's a place in the world for the angry young man  
With his working class ties and his radical plans  
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl  
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.  
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost  
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  
  
Give a moment or two to the angry young man  
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand  
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood  
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good  
He sits in a room with a lock on the door  
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  
  
I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage,  
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight  
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view  
Life went on no matter who was wrong or right.  
  
And there's always a place for the angry young man  
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand  
He's never been able to learn from mistakes  
He can't understand why his heart always breaks  
He's honest and pure and has courage as well  
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell  
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man.  
  
There's a place in the world for the angry young man

Some days when I'm far away  
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion  
Some nights when I'm wound so tight  
There is no release, there is no solution  
In hell there's a big hotel  
Where the bar just closed and the windows never open  
No phone so you can't call home  
And the TV works, but the clicker is broken  
But in the darkness I see your light turned on  
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to  
CHORUS  
Blonde over blue  
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire  
Blonde over blue  
They shine as though you're burning inside  
One word from you is all I need to be inspired  
Blonde over blue  
I need your inspiration tonight  
These days there's a million ways  
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected  
These times there are sins and crimes  
On the morning shows for the disconnected  
I look and I write my book  
And I walk away with the wrong impressions  
I don't care 'cause I've done my share  
And I need some time for my own obsessions  
It doesn't matter, I've let that life go by  
It's been forgotten 'cause all I wanted was you  
CHORUS  
These days not a damn soul prays  
And there is no faith 'cause there's nothing to believe in  
These days only good luck pays  
If we don't get paid then we try to get even  
I look and I write my book  
And I have my say and I draw conclusions  
Some nights when I'm wound so tight  
There is no release, there is no solution  
But in the darkness I see your light turned on  
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to  
CHORUS


Careless talk  
That's what you heard about me  
Jealous talk  
That's what I heard about you  
Everybody's telling lies  
I don't even know why  
Why can't people  
Find something better to do  
Careless talk  
I don't believe what they say  
I heard them talk  
They say you've been putting me down  
In the shadows on the phone  
They won't leave us alone  
They've been talking  
Ever since you came around  
Careless talk  
Telling you I'm doing wrong  
Jealous talk  
Follows wherever you go  
I'm aware of what you heard  
Every terrible word  
Everybody's making believe that they know  
All of the intimate things  
That we ever might have said  
In the heat of a passionate moment  
In a conversation shared  
For the ears of nobody else  
There are some things they will never hear  
There are secrets I'll never tell  
Careless talk  
Going around on the streets  
Jealous talk  
I know how bad it can be  
Let them stand where they fall  
They don't know us at all  
All that talking won't make a difference to me  
  


Here I am again  
In this smoky place  
With my brandy eyes  
I'm talking to myself  
You were the one  
You were the one  
  
Here I go again  
Looking for your face  
And I realize  
That I should look for someone else  
But you were the one  
You were the one  
  
I'm looking for comfort  
That I can take  
From someone else  
But after all  
I know there is no one  
That can save me from myself  
You were the only one  
  
Me revoici  
Dans ce bar enfume  
Avec mes yeux ivres  
Je me parle a moi meme  
C'etait toi  
C'etait toi  
  
Me revoici  
Cherchant ton visage  
Et je realise  
Que je devrais en chercher une autre  
C'etait toi  
You were the one  
  
Je recherche l'affection  
Qu'une autre pourrait me donner  
Mais apres tout  
Je sais qu'il n'y a personne  
Personne qui puisse me sauver  
Tu etais la seule  
  
I'm looking for comfort  
That I can take  
From someone else  
But after al  
I know there is no one  
That can save me, save me from myself  
You were the only one


Let me tell you a story  
About a woman and a man  
Maybe you will find familiar  
Maybe you won't understand  
The man's name I don't remember  
He was always Joe to me  
But I can't forget the woman  
She was always Christie Lee  
He was working in a night club  
That's where he played the saxophone  
He used to fake to stock arrangements  
He left the customers alone  
But one night before the last song  
About a quarter after three  
He saw her standing at the coat check  
And made his move on Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
She was a nice piece of music  
She had a rhythm all her own  
He blew a solo like a blind man  
She really dug his saxophone  
She wanted more than just an encore  
And he could play in every key  
He left the stage and packed his alto  
And took it home with Christie Lee  
Oh I heard the man knew "the Bird" like the Bible  
You know the man could blow an educated axe  
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman  
Who didn't need another lover  
All she wanted was the sax  
It took a while for him to notice  
It took a while for him to see  
He was never in control here  
It was always Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Oh the man took a calculated gamble  
Yes the man had the power to perform  
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle  
She didn't need him as a man  
All she wanted was the horn  
They say that Joe became a wino  
They say he always drinks alone  
They say he stumbles like a blind man  
They say he sold his saxophone  
Even the band must face the music  
That's what the moral is to me  
The only time you hit the high note  
Is when you play for Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

It's evening in the desert  
I'm tired and I'm cold  
But I am just a soldier  
I do what I am told  
  
We came with the crusaders  
To save the holy land  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
And no one gives a damn  
  
And I just got your letter  
And this is what I read you said  
I'm fading from your memory  
So I'm just as good as dead  
  
We are the armies of the empire  
We are ethe legionnaires of Rome  
  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
And we ain't never coming home  
We came to bring these people freedom  
We came to fight the infidel  
There is no justice in the desert  
Because there is no God in hell  
  
They say Osama's in the mountains  
Deep in a cave near Pakistan  
But there's a sea of blood in Baghdad  
A sea of oil in the sand  
Between the Tigris and Euphrates  
Another day comes to an end  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
Piece on Earth goodwill to men  
  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
It's Christmas in Fallujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Marry Christmas from Fallujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Marry Christmas from Fallujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah [5x]  
  
Oo-ra!


Blackout, heatwave,.44 caliber homicide  
The bums drop dead and the dogs go mad  
In packs on the West Side  
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide  
She wants to hit those bricks  
Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline  
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place  
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face  
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound  
I don't want to hear it but he won't turn it down  
Life is tough but it's just enough  
To hold back the tears until it's closing time  
I survived, I'm still alive  
But I'm getting close to the borderline  
Close to the borderline  
  
A buck three eighty  
Won't buy you much lately on the street these days  
And when you can get gas  
You know you can't drive fast anymore on the parkways  
Rich man, poor man, either way American  
Shoved into the lost and found  
The no-nukes yell we're gonna all go to hell  
With the next big meltdown  
I got remote control and a color T.V.  
I don't change channels so they must change me  
I got real close friends that will get me high  
They don't know how to talk and they ain't gonna try  
I shouldn't bitch, I shouldn't cry  
I'd start a revolution but I don't have time  
I don't know why I'm still a nice guy  
But I'm getting close to the borderline  
Close to the borderline  
  
I thought I'd sacrificed so many things  
I thought I'd thrown them all away  
I didn't think I needed anything  
But you can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay  
  
I need a doctor for my pressure pills  
I need a lawyer for my medical bills  
I need a banker to finance my home  
But I need security to back my loan  
It isn't new what I'm going through  
But everybody knows you got to break sometime  
Another night I fought the good fight  
But I'm getting closer to the borderline  
Closer to the borderline


Everybody's got a million questions  
Everybody wants to know the score  
What you went through  
It's something you  
Should be over now  
Everybody wants to hear the secrets  
That you never told a soul before  
And it's not that strange  
Because it wouldn't change  
What happened anyhow  
But you swore to yourself a long time ago  
There were some things that people never needed to know  
Guess there's one that you keep  
That you bury so deep  
No one can tear it out  
And you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
And you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
You don't want to lose a friendship  
There's nothing that you have to hide  
And a little dirt  
Couldn't hurt no one anyway  
And you still have a rage inside you  
That you carry with a certain pride  
In the only part of the broken heart  
That you could ever save  
But you've been through it once  
You know how it ends  
You don't see the point  
Of going through it again  
And this ain't the place  
And this ain't the time  
And neither's any other day  
So you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
So you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons  
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone forever  
And if a vow is what it takes  
Haven't you paid for your mistakes  
After the moment passes  
And the impulse disappears  
You can still hold back  
Because you don't crack very easily  
It's a time honored resolution  
Because the danger is always near  
It's with you now  
But that ain't how it was supposed to be  
And it's hard to believe after all these years  
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears  
And you feel like a fool  
Because it's part of your rules  
You've got a memory  
But you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
But you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
  


(This one's for Alexa, okay?)  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah... Ah, ah ah, ah...  
  
Well, it's been building up inside of me for, oh, I don't know how long  
I don't know why but I keep thinking something's bound to go wrong  
But she looks in my eyes and makes me realize and she says  
  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby) Ooh ooh  
  
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut when I started to brag about my car  
But I can't back down now because I pushed the other guys too far  
She makes me come alive and makes me wanna drive when she says  
  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
  
She told me, baby when you race today, just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby, nothing could go wrong with you  
Oh, what she does to me when she makes love to me and she says...  
  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)


I don't believe in first impressions  
But just this once I hope that looks don't deceive  
I ain't got time for true confessions  
I've got to make the move right now  
Got to meet that girl somehow  
I've gotta get it right the first time  
That's the main thing, oohh oohh  
I can't afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing, ooh ooh  
Gonna have to make the first time last  
La, la, la, la, la (Repeat)  
  
I'm not much good at conversation  
I was never too smooth at comin' on real strong  
If all it takes is inspiration  
Then I might have just what it takes  
If I don't make no bad mistakes and I get it right the first time  
That's the main thing  
Can't afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing  
Have to make the first time last  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Repeat)  
  
I might find the courage, yeah  
I might get up the nerve  
But if my timing ain't just right  
What purpose would it serve?  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know how to say those first few words  
If I want to put myself in touch  
The first few moments mean so much  
  
So I suppose it's now or never  
Before that woman walks right out of my life  
Just let me pull myself together  
I've got to give it one good try  
Gotta take my chance tonight  
I've gotta get it right the first time  
That's the main thing  
I can't afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time it's not the same thing  
Gonna have to make the first time last  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Repeat)


What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?  
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?  
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?  
Welcome back to the age of jive  
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?  
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money  
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound  
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me.  
  
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?  
Can't you tell that it's out of style?  
Should I get a set of white wall tires?  
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?  
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental  
You best bet's a true baby blue Continental  
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk  
It's still rock and roll to me.  
  
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers  
Cause it's always been the same old scene  
There's a new band in town  
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...  
Aimed at your average teen.  
  
How about a pair of pink sidewinders  
And a bright orange pair of pants?  
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby  
If you just give it half a chance  
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers  
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers  
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways  
It's still rock and roll to me.  
  
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?  
Don't you know that they're out of touch?  
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?  
If you are then you think too much  
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?  
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money  
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways  
It's still rock and roll to me.  
  
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound  
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me.


If it seems like I've been lost  
In let's remember  
If you think I'm feeling older  
And missing my younger days  
Oh, then you should have known  
Me much better  
Cause my past is something that never  
Got in my way  
Oh no  
  
Still I would not be here now  
If I never had the hunger  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The wild boys were my friends  
Oh  
Cause I never felt the desire  
'Til their music set me on fire  
And then I was saved, yeah  
That's why I'm keeping the faith  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Keeping the faith  
  
We wore matador boots  
Only Flagg Brothers had them with the Cuban heel  
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt  
And a tight pair of chinos  
Oh  
I put on my shark skin jacket  
You know the kind with the velvet collar  
And ditty-bop shades  
Oh yeah  
I took a fresh pack of Luckies  
And a mint called Sen-Sen  
My old man's Trojans  
And his Old Spice after shave  
Oh  
Combed my hair in a pompadour  
Like the rest of the Romeos wore  
A permanent wave  
Yeah  
We were keeping the faith  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Keeping the faith  
  
You can get just so much  
From a good thing  
You can linger too long  
In your dreams  
Say goodbye to the  
Oldies but goodies  
Cause the good ole days weren't  
Always good  
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems  
  
Learned stickball as a formal education  
Lost a lot of fights  
But it taught me how to lose O.K.  
Oh  
I heard about sex  
But not enough  
I found you could dance  
And still look tough anyway  
Oh yes I did  
I found out a man ain't just being macho  
Ate an awful lot of late night drive-in food  
Drank a lot of take-home pay  
I thought I was the Duke of Earl  
When I made it with a red-haired girl  
In the Chevrolet  
Oh yeah  
We were keeping the faith  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Keeping the faith  
  
You know the good ole days weren't  
Always good  
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems  
  
Now I told you my reasons  
For the whole revival  
Now I'm going outside to have  
An ice cold beer in the shade  
Oh  
I'm going to listen to my 45's  
Ain't it wonderful to be alive  
When the rock 'n' roll plays  
Yeah  
When the memory stays  
Yeah  
I'm keeping the faith  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Keeping the faith  
I'm keeping the faith  
Yes I am


Even though I'm in love  
Sometimes I get so afraid  
I'll say something so wrong  
Just to have something to say  
  
I know the moment isn't right  
To tell the girl a comical line  
To keep the conversation light  
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind  
  
But if that's how I feel  
Then it's the best feeling I've even known  
It's undeniably real  
Leave a tender moment alone  
  
Yes I know I'm in love  
But just when I ought to relax  
I put my foot in my mouth  
'Cause I'm just avoiding the facts  
  
If the girl gets too close  
If I need some room to escape  
When the moment arose  
I'd tell her it's all a mistake  
  
But that's not how I feel  
No that's not the woman I've known  
She's undeniably real  
So leave a tender moment alone  
  
But it's not only me  
Breaking down when the tension gets high  
Just when I'm in a serious mood  
She is suddenly quiet and shy  
  
Leave a tender moment  
Leave it alone  
  
I know the moment isn't right  
To hold my emotions inside  
To change the attitude tonight  
I've run out of places to hide  
  
And if that's how I feel  
Then it's the best feeling I've even known  
It's undeniably real  
Leave a tender moment alone  
  
You got to leave a tender moment alone  
Leave a tender moment  
Leave it alone  
You've got to leave a tender moment  
Leave a tender moment alone


You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper  
With her high top sneakers of Italian design  
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension  
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind  
  
Now you're in trouble, maybe she's an intellectual  
What if she figures out you're not very smart  
Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal  
Boy, you got to get it settled  
Cause she's breaking your heart  
  
Don't try to put on an act  
You can't do that to a modern woman  
And you're an old fashioned man  
She understands the things you're doin'  
She's a modern woman  
  
She looks sleek and she seems so professional  
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see  
You want to make a move  
But you feel so inferior  
Cause under that exterior  
Is someone who's free  
  
She's got style and she's got her own money  
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm  
She's got the eyes that make you realize  
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm  
  
You've got your plan of attack  
That won't attract the modern woman  
And you're an old fashioned man  
She understands the things you're doin'  
She's a modern woman  
  
Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment  
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why  
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper  
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy  
  
But times have changed  
Things are not the same, baby  
You overcame such a bad attitude  
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks  
And nowadays it's politics  
And after 1986 what else could we do?  
  
You got to learn to relax  
And face the facts of modern woman  
And you're an old fashioned man  
She understands the things you're doin'  
She's a modern woman


Anthony works in the grocery store  
Savin his pennies for some day  
Mama Leone left a note on the door  
She said "Sonny move out to the country"  
Ah but working too hard can give you  
A heart attack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack  
You ought-a know by now  
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?  
Is that all you get for your money?  
  
And it seems such a waste of time  
If that's what it's all about  
Mama if that's movin up then I'm movin out  
Mm I' movin out, mm oo oo uh huh mm hm  
  
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin the beat  
At night he becomes a bartender  
He works at Mister Cacciatores  
Down on Sullivan Street  
Across from the medical center  
And he's tradin in his Chevy for  
A Cadillac ack ack ack ack ack  
You ought-a know by now  
If he can't drive with a broken back  
At least he can polish the fenders  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
You should never argue with a crazy mi mi mi mi mi mind  
You ought-a know by now  
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime  
Is that all you get for your money  
And if that's what you have in mind  
Then that's what you're all about  
Good luck movin up cause I'm movin out  
Mm I'm movin out Mm oo oo uh huh mm hm


The sins of Amsterdam  
Were still a recent surprise  
And we were flying over  
Scandinavian Skies  
We climbed towards the sun  
We turned and cursed as one  
We pulled the shades  
And closed our eyes  
The Stockholm city lights  
Were slowly starting to rise  
And we were strapped against  
Those Scandinavian skies  
The landing gear came down  
And touched the Swedish ground  
And we were all so paralyzed  
On the plane  
We were mainly sound and lights  
In the veins  
We could play the blues all night  
The tour of Germany  
Was bleeding into our eyes  
And we were sailing over  
Scandinavian skies  
We had the Midas touch  
Until we met the Dutch  
And they exhausted our supplies  
Who's to pay?  
For this international flight  
Who could stay  
We were only there for the night  
We watched the power fall  
Inside the Olso hall  
While all the cold Norweigians cried  
Who could say  
What was left and where was right?  
By the way  
I could play the blues all night  
  


Safe at harbor, everything is easy  
Off to starboard, daylight comes up fast  
Now I'm restless for the open water  
Red flags are flying fromhe Coast Guard mast  
They told me to stay, I heard all the information  
I motored away and steered straight ahead  
Though the weatherman said  
CHORUS  
There's a storm front coming (mood indigo)  
White water running and the pressure is low  
Storm front coming (mood indigo)  
Small craft warning on the radio  
I've been sailing a long time on this ocean  
Man gets lonesome, all those years at sea  
I've got a woman, my life should be easy  
Most men hunger for the life I lead  
The morning was gray, but I had the motivation  
I drifted away and ran into more  
Heavy weather off shore  
CHORUS  
We've got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze  
We've got a falling barometer and rising seas  
We've got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale  
We've got a force nine blowing on the Beaufort scale  
I'm still restless for the open water  
Though she gives me everything I need  
She asked me to stay, but I'd done my navigation  
I drove her away, but I should have known  
To stay tied up at home  
CHORUS  


Streetlife serenader  
Never sang on stages  
Needs no orchestration  
Melody comes easy  
Midnight masquerader  
Shoppin' center heroes  
Child of Eisenhower  
New world celebrator  
Streetlife serenaders  
Have such understanding  
How the words are spoken  
How to make the motions  
Streetlife serenaders  
Have no obligations  
Hold no grand illusions  
Need no stimulation  
Midnight masqueraders  
Workin' hard for wages  
Need no vast arrangements  
To do their harmonizing  


They say that these are not the best of times  
But they're the only times I've ever known  
And I believe there is a time for meditation  
In cathedrals of our own  
  
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes  
But I can only stand apart and sympathize  
For we are always what our situations hand us  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
So we'll argue and we'll compromise  
And realize that nothing's ever changed  
For all our mutual experience  
Our separate conclusions are the same  
  
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity  
Our reason coexists with our insanity  
Though we choose between reality and madness  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies  
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies  
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities  
It's either sadness or euphoria


I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons  
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone foreverand if a vow is what it takes  
Haven't you paid for your mistakesafter the moment passes  
And the impulse disappearsyou can still hold back  
Because you don't crack very easilyit's a time-honored resolution  
Because the danger is always nearit's with you now  
But that ain't how it was supposed to be  
And it's hard to believe after all these years  
It still gives you pain and it still brings tearsand you feel like a fool  
'Cause in spite of the rulesyou've got a memorychorus


This is your life, you've got problems with your wife  
She was makin' mashed potatoes now she gives you Minute Rice  
And she used to do your laundry now she sends it out instead  
And she always made believe that she was satisfied in bed  
  
That's what she used to say but that's how things were yesterday  
Looks like the good ole days were gone  
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history  
Time has the way of movin' on  
  
Oh I know she was there when you needed lovin' care  
When she only used the car to drive the children everywhere  
And I'm sure she washed the windows I'm sure she waxed doors  
But now she doesn't call you her Prince Charming anymore  
  
That's what she used to say but that's how things were yesterday  
Looks like the good ole days were gone  
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history  
Time has the way of movin' on  
  
She's not the sweet little girl that she was before  
You're not the end of the world anymore, you're not the end of the world  
  
She wins when you fight and she goes to school at night  
She leaves you home to babysit and watch "The Price Is Right"  
And she wants the joint 2 count to see where all the money goes  
So she doesn't have to talk you into buying all the clothes, solo  
  
[humming "da-da-da"]  
  
That's what she used to say but that what things were yesterday  
Looks like the good ole days was bored  
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history  
Time bridged the way of movin' on  
  
She's not your li--little girl that she was before  
You're not the end of the world anymore, you're not the end of the world...
End


Advice is cheap you can take it from me  
It's your's to keep cause opinions are free  
Nobody knows about the trouble I've seen  
Nobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean  
It coasts too much and takes too long to find out too late  
Some words aren't heard 'til after they're spoken  
Your role was protective, your soul was too defective  
Some people just don't have a heart to be broken  
  
We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China  
If you only had a little more faith in me  
In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum  
reminders will still shine bright  
All the king's men and all the king's horse  
Can't put you together the way you used to be  
We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China  
  
You take a piece of whatever you touch  
Too many pieces means you're touching too much  
You never win if you can't play it straight  
You only beat me if you get me to hate  
It must be so lonely to think that you have only  
Somebody elses life to live if they let you  
I ain't too selective, but it don't take no detective  
To find out how fast your friends will forget you  
  
We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China  
Now all you're going to be is history  
Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight  
You coulda had class, you coulda been a contender  
Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me  
You could have been standing, standing on the Great Wall of China  
  
This was not your calling, just look how far you've fallen  
I heard your story, man, you've got to be joking  
Keep things in perspective, this is my true objective  
Why tear this heart out if it's only been broken?  
  
We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China  
If you only had a little more faith in me  
In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum  
reminders will still shine bright  
All the king's men and all the king's horse  
Can't put you together the way you used to be  
We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China


One... Two... And-a-one, and-a-two, and-a-buckle-my-shoe  
  
There you are but nowhere left to hide  
All the toys are tried to put aside  
I think you'd meet them, but that's the price of freedom  
But that's the cost of living in the prime of your life  
  
We done say... Da da da da dum dum dum...  
Dum da dum... Ah dum da dum du dum...  
Ah dum da da dum... There's no more conversation...  
Luh ba dum bum, living in the prime of your life  
  
Oh oh ba da da dum ba da da dum ba wah  
Dadadada ba dum da da da dum da wah  
  
Dadada... Da da da da dum dum dum...  
Dum da dum... Ah dum da is crying la la lum...  
Your own reflection will answer all your questions  
If you don't believe you're in the prime of your life...... Four......
Five...... Bridge......  
  
Oh oh ba dada dum ba dada dum ba wah...  
Dadadada ba dum da da da dum da wah  
  
Da da da da dum dum dum, dum, da dum... Ah dum da dum du dum...  
Ah dum da da dum... It's only make believe  
And that's the take you're living in the prime of your life  
Four...... Five...... Four...... Five...... Four......


We walked on the beach beside that old hotel  
They're tearing it down now  
But it's just as well  
I haven't shown you everything a man can do  
So stay with me baby  
I've got plans for you  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
And now I need the rest of you  
  
Did you know that before you came into my life  
It was some kind of miracle that I survived  
Some day we will both look back  
And have to laugh  
We lived through a lifetime  
And the aftermath  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
I know we've got to move somehow  
But I don't want to lose you know  
  
Sometimes it's so easy  
To let a day  
Slip on by  
Without even seeing each other at all  
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I  
And those will be the days you can never recall  
  
And so we embrace again  
Behind the dunes  
This beach is cold  
On winter afternoons  
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun  
I'm warm from the memory of days to come  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
But we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
But now I need the rest of you


Didn't I say  
I wasn't ready for romance?  
Didn't we promise  
We would only be friends?  
And so we danced  
Though it was only a slow dance,  
I started breaking my promises right there and then  
  
Didn't I swear  
There would be no complications?  
Didn't you want  
Someone who's seen it all before?  
Now that you're here  
It's not the same situation,  
Suddenly I don't remember the rules anymore  
  
This night is mine  
It's only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
I've been around  
Someone like me should know better  
Falling in love  
Would be the worst thing I could do  
Didn't I say  
I needed time to forget her?  
Aren't you running  
From someone who's not over you?  
  
How many nights  
Have I been lonely without you?  
I tell myself  
How much I really don't care  
How many nights  
Have I been thinking about you?  
Wanting to hold you  
But knowing you would not be there  
  
But this night you're mine  
It's only you and I  
I'll tell you to forget yesterday  
This night we are together  
  
This night is mine  
It's only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
This night  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Tomorrow is such a long time away  
This night can last forever


[Incomprehensible] is flowing  
Through these phantom eyes  
They're starting it good  
  
It's all I dream, we're the same  
But then you refused  
I thought you could  
  
Time and time again  
I cursed the day you left me  
  
But now don't expect me  
'Cause all I've left is sorrow  
I shouldn't wash out all tomorrows  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
You thought you was superior  
I thought now you see that I'm a perfume  
  
Then I'm the only one  
Who could ever love you  
I know it sure looks so pure  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Would you plan to [Incomprehensible]  
This love with an instant linger  
  
I still can feel the touch, loving single  
Of your hand, of my mind  
Of your hand, of your mind, yeah


Hey Lord, take a look all around  
And I'd a find where my baby's gonna be  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
'Cause she is far across the sea  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that she's gonna be alright  
And things are gonna be alright with me  
  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet  
Said now, would ya guide her on the roads  
And make them softer for her feet  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that she's gonna be alright  
Until she's home and here with me  
  
Hey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
If she is sleepin' under the sky  
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on  
Is always warm and dry  
Um, don'tcha give her too much rain  
Try to keep her away from pain  
Because my baby hates to cry  
  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
'Cause it gets rough along the way  
Said now, this song seems strange is just because  
I don't know how to pray  
Um, won'tcha give her peace of mind  
And if you ever find the time  
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday  
  
Hey Lord, take a look all around  
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
'Cause she is far across the sea  
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that she's gonna be alright  
Until she's home and here with me  
With me


Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream  
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean  
You make believe the past was just a dream  
You make believe the past was just a dream  
Turn around, turn around  
And I will sing for you a song  
I don't know where you been  
But you've been gone too long  
Oh, Elisa, you must begin again  
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end  
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend  
I loved you but I thought I was your friend  
Turn around, turn around  
And I will sing for you a song  
I don't know where you been  
But you've been gone too long  
Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea  
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me  
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be  
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be  
So turn around, turn around  
And I will sing for you a song  
And I don't know where you been  
But you've been gone too long  
  


Uptown girl  
She's been living in her uptown world  
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy  
I bet her momma never told her why  
  
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl  
She's been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now she's looking for a downtown man  
That's what I am  
  
And when she knows what  
She wants from her time  
And when she wakes up  
And makes up her mind  
  
She'll see I'm not so tough  
Just because  
I'm in love with an uptown girl  
You know I've seen her in her uptown world  
She's getting tired of her high class toys  
And all her presents from her uptown boys  
She's got a choice  
  
Uptown girl  
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls  
But maybe someday when my ship comes in  
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been  
And then I'll win  
  
And when she's walking  
She's looking so fine  
And when she's talking  
She'll say that she's mine  
  
She'll say I'm not so tough  
Just because  
I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
She's been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now she's looking for a downtown man  
That's what I am  
  
Uptown girl  
She's my uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl

Well I see you in the morning  
Putting on your pretty clothes  
And I watch you do your make-up  
Like they do in all those fashion shows  
Then you turn to me so that I can see  
If you put yourself together right  
Then you go away and you're gone all day  
But I know you're coming home tonight  
And when you're home,  
Darling all you've got to be is you  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Well it's alright if you're tired  
When your day is done  
You can see when you look at me,  
You're not the only one  
It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl  
But you can't let them see you cry  
It's a fact of life, now man and wife  
Work full time to just get by  
And when we're home all  
It's gonna be is me and you  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
I've done some strange things I  
Never thought I'd do before  
But if the strain brings happiness,  
More or less.  
More or less.  
  
Then I don't mind masquerading  
With all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
And when times are tough, I've got just enough  
If you're standing right by my side  
Darling more and more I get hungry for  
All the ways you keep me satisfied  
On our own there ain't nothing  
That we can't get through  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone  
All we've got to be is me and you  
On our own there ain't nothing  
That we can't get through  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Swing that hammer and break that stone  
Push those buttons and answer that phone  
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night  
Everybody's working up a big appetite  
Do as the Romans do.


At last  
My love has come along  
My lonely days are over  
And life is like a song  
  
At last  
The skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
And I found a dream that I can speak to  
A dream that I can call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
Oh, you smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last


Be Careful, It's My Heart  
Bing Crosby  
Words and music by Irving Berlin  
-From the musical "Holiday Inn"  
Sweetheart of mine, I've sent you a valentine.  
Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine.  
Be careful, it's my heart.  
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.  
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.  
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.  
Remember it's my heart.  
The heart with which so willingly I part.  
It's yours to take to keep or break,  
But please, before you start,  
Be careful, it's my heart.  
From: Gloria "Montcomags"  


Down in old Kentucky where horseshoes are lucky  
There's a village smithy standin' under the chestnut tree  
Hear the hammer knockin', see the anvil rockin'  
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes  
  
See the hot sparks a-flyin' like fourth of July-in'  
He's even got the horses cloppin' pop, down the avenue  
Folks love the rhythm, the clang bangin' rhythm  
You'll get a lot of kicks out of the blacksmith blues

We'll have a blue room  
A new room for two room  
Where every day's a holiday  
Because you're married to me  
  
Not like a ballroom  
A small room a hall room  
Where I can smoke my pipe away  
With your wee head upon my knee  
  
We will thrive on keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With 'Mr' and 'Mrs'  
On little blue chairs  
  
You'll sew your trousseau  
Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs  
  
Yes we'll thrive on keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With 'Mr' and 'Mrs'  
Sitting on little blue chair  
  
You'll sew your trousseau  
And Mr. Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs  
  
It's a new room  
And it's a blue room  
Just for you and I


We were waltzin' together to a dreamy melody  
When they called out "Change partners"  
And you waltzed away from me  
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor  
And I'll keep on changing partners  
Till I hold you once more  
  
Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart  
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then  
Oh, my darlin' I will never change partners again

Evelina, won't ya ever take a shine to that moon?  
Evelina, ain't ya bothered by the bobolink's tune?  
Tell me, tell me how long  
Ya gonna keep delayin'the day.  
Don't ya reckon it's wrong  
Trifflin' with April this way?  
Evelina, won't ya pay a little mind to me soon?  
Wake up! wake up!  
The earth is fair, the fruit is fine  
But what's the use o' smellin' winter water melon  
Clingin' to another fella's vine?  
Evelina, won't ya roll off that vine an' be mine?


I used to have a perfect sweetheart  
Not a real one, just a dream  
A wonderful vision of us as a team  
Can you imagine how I feel now  
Love is real now, it's ideal  
You're just what I wanted  
And now it's nice to live  
Paradise to live  
  
I know why I've waited  
Know why I've been blue  
Prayed each night for someone  
Exactly like you  
  
Why should we spend money  
On a show or two  
No one does those love scenes  
Exactly like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I want to hand the world to you  
I hope you'll understand  
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'  
And dream I'm dreamin'  
  
Now I know why mother  
Taught me to be true  
She meant me for someone  
Exactly like you


Feuding and fussing and a-fighting  
Sometimes it gets to be exciting  
Don't like them ornery neighbors down by the creek  
We'll be plumb out of neighbors next week  
  
Grandma, poor old grandma  
Why'd they have to shoot poor grandma  
She lies 'neath the clover  
Someone caught her bending over  
  
Picking up a daisy  
Feuding and fussing and a-fighting  
This is a wrong that needs a righting  
Let's get that funeral service over  
So then we can start in a-feuding again  
  
Feuding and fighting and a-fussing  
That's all that's going on with using  
We are such neighborly people peaceful and sweet  
All except when we happen to meet  
Daughter, baby daughter  
  
Poisoned all the neighbors chickens  
Daughter hadn't oughter  
Least until she could run like the dickens  
They hit her with a shovel  
  
Feuding and fighting and a-fussing  
No use a-standing here a-cussing  
Let's give our daughter a pistol now that she's four  
And go feuding and fighting some more


A fine romance with no kisses  
A fine romance, my friend, this is  
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes (to-mah-toes, dear)  
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed po-tah-toes (potatoes)  
  
A fine romance, you won't nestle  
A fine romance, you won't even wrestle  
You've never mussed the crease in my blue serge pants  
You never take a chance, this is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, my good fellow  
You take romance, I'll take Jello  
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean  
At least they flap their fins to express emotion  
  
A fine romance, my dear Duchess  
Two old fogies, we really need crutches  
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France! (Fronce)  
I haven't got a chonce (chance), this is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, my good woman  
My strong, aged-in-the-wood woman  
You never give those orchids I send a glance  
They're just like cactus plants, (oh boy)  
This is a fine romance!


The bells are ringin' for me and my gal  
Birds are singin' for me and my gal  
Everybody's been knowin', to a weddin' they're goin'  
And for weeks they've been sewin' every Susie and Sal  
  
They're congregatin', bathin', waitin'  
For me an' my gal  
The Parson's waitin'  
For me and my gal  
  
An' sometime we're gonna build a little home  
For two or three or four or more  
In Loveland for me and my gal


Frosty, the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty, the snowman is a fairy tale, they say  
He was made of snow but the children know  
That he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Thumpetty, thump, thump, thumpety, thump, thump  
Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow  
  
Frosty, the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now, before I melt away"  
  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there, all around the square  
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
He only paused a moment  
When he heard him holler, "Stop"  
  
Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin', "Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day, I'll be back again some day  
I'll be back again some day"


God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly Father, a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name


I'll tell you why I can't find you  
Every time I go out to your place  
  
You gone fishin' (well how you know)  
Well there's a sign upon your door (uh-huh)  
Gone fishin' (I'm real gone man)  
You ain't workin' anymore (could be)  
There's your hoe out in the sun  
Where you left a row half done  
You claim that hoein' ain't no fun (well I can prove it)  
You ain't got no ambition  
  
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool (Shangrila, really la)  
I'm wishin' I could be that kind of fool (should I twist your arm?)  
I'd say no more work for mine (welcome to the club)  
On my door I'd hang a sign  
Gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'  
  
Papa Bing (yeah Louis)  
I stopped by your place a time or two lately  
And you aren't home either  
Well, I'm a busy man Louis. I got a lotta deals cookin'  
I was probably tied up at the studio  
You weren't tied up you dog  
You was just plain old  
  
Gone fishin' (bah-boo-bah-boo-bah-boo-bah-boo-bah)  
There's a sign upon your door (Pops, don't blab it around, will you?)  
Gone fishin' (keep it shady, I got me a big one staked out)  
Mmm, you ain't workin' anymore (I don't have to work, I got me a piece of
Gary)  
Cows need milkin' in the barn (I have the twins on that detail, they each take
a side)  
But you just don't give a darn (give 'em four bits a cow and hand lotion)  
You just never seem to learn (man, you taught me)  
You ain't got no ambition (you're convincin' me)  
  
Gone fishin' (bah-boo-dah-do-dah-do-dah-do)  
Got your hound dog by your side (that's old Cindy-Lou goin' with me)  
Gone fishin' (mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)  
Fleas are bitin' at his hide (get away from me boy, you bother me)  
  
Mmm, folks won't find us now because  
Mister Satch and Mister Cros  
We gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'  
Bah-boo-baby-bah-boo-bah-bay-mmm-bo-bay  
Oh yeah!


Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you  
Fine, fine, fine, that's you, that's you  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
Your tasty lips are sweeter than a lollipop  
And every time I kiss you oh I hate to stop  
Keep talkin'  
I wrack my brain to find the proper adjective  
A sentimental compliment to give you.  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you  
Fine, fine, fine, that's you, that's you  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you.  
Yum, yum, yum, that's you, that's you  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, that's you, that's you  
Yum, yum, yum, that's you, that's you.  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
I never went to Eaton University  
Therefore I have a limited vocabulary  
  
And so I use the language that I have on hand  
While making love to you on your veranda  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you.  
Fine, fine, fine, that's you, that's you  
  
Good, Good, Good,  
Serweet.  
Fine, fine, fine  
Yum, yum, yum  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you!


I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do  
I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why, you just do  
  
You never seem to want my romancing  
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
I don't know why, why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do  
  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do  
I don't know why, why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why but you do  
  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Why the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do


We've played the game of 'stay away'  
But it costs more than I can pay  
Without you I can't make my way  
I surrender, dear  
  
Little mean things we were doin'  
Must have been part of the game  
Lending a spice to the wound  
Oh, but I don't care who's to blame  
  
When stars appear and shadows fall  
Why then you'll hear my poor heart call  
To you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender, dear  
  
Oh, to you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender, dear


I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve'll find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams


I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces all day through  
In that small cafe, the park across the way  
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you  
  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you


I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen  
Across the ocean wild and wide  
To where your heart has ever been  
Since first you were my Bonnie bride.  
The roses all have left your cheek.  
I've watched them fade away and die  
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak  
And tears bedim your loving eyes.  
  
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!  
  
I know you love me, Kathleen, dear  
Your heart was ever fond and true.  
I always feel when you are near  
That life holds nothing dear, but you.  
The smiles that once you gave to me  
I scarcely ever see them now  
Though many, many times I see  
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.  
  
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!  
  
To that dear home beyond the sea  
My Kathleen shall again return.  
And when thy old friends welcome thee  
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.  
Where laughs the little silver stream  
Beside your mother's humble cot  
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam  
There all your grief will be forgot.  
  
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!


I'll walk alone  
But to tell you the truth, I'll be lonely  
I don't mind being lonely  
When my heart tells me you are lonely, too  
  
I'll walk alone  
They'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather  
There are dreams I must gather  
Dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight  
  
I'll always be near you wherever you are each night  
In every prayer  
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
  
Please walk alone  
And send your love and your kisses to guide me  
Till you're walking beside me  
I'll walk alone  
  
I'll always be near you wherever you are each night  
In every prayer  
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
  
Please walk alone,  
And send your love and your kisses to guide me  
Till you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone  
I'll walk alone


I got a gal who's always late  
Any time we have a date  
But I love her  
Yes I love her  
  
I'm gonna walk right up to her gate  
And see if I can get it straight  
'Cause I want her  
I'm gonna ask her  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Way you're acting lately makes me doubt  
Youse is still my baby, baby  
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out  
  
A woman is a creature that has always been strange  
Just when you're sure of what you'll find  
She's gone and made a change  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Maybe baby's found somebody new  
Or is my baby still my baby true  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Maybe baby's found somebody new  
Or is my baby still my baby true


Why do I do just as you say?  
Why must I just give you your way?  
Why do I sigh?  
Why do I try to forget?  
  
It must have been that something lovers call "Fate"  
Kept on saying I had to wait  
I saw them all  
Just couldn't fall till we met  
  
It had to be you, it had to be you  
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who  
Could make me be true, could make me be blue  
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you  
  
Some others I've seen might never be mean  
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill  
With all your faults, I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you


When a bird young and free  
Hangs around a certain tree  
Singing serenades that tell his love is true  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
And when a cat on a fence  
Keeps his darling in suspense  
And he's brave enough to face a well-aimed shoe  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
And you know every dove  
Has its heart set on love  
Rabbits, too, pet and pat  
And there's nothing wrong with that  
  
When a boy such as I  
Tries so hard to qualify  
With a very lovely lady such as you  
Can't you see it's the natural thing to do  
  
And then the girl she acts demure  
The boy he feels proud and sure  
So proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous  
Fine thing  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
But the girl she just won't agree  
She whimpers and she simpers  
And he begs on bended knee  
But she runs away because she knows full well he'll pursue  
The chump  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
Then the boy in despair  
Waves his arms, tears his hair  
Stamps his feet and he acts like mad  
Then you know that he's got it bad  
  
Then the girl she ought to fall  
If she's got a heart at all  
She should take him in her arms  
And kiss him too  
Oh! Oh! Just the natural thing to do


Happiness comes with success  
And that I guess is true  
But success is more or less  
A point of view  
  
I'm no millionaire  
But I'm not the type to care  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams  
It's my universe  
Even with an empty purse  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams  
  
I wouldn't take the wealth of Wall Street  
For a road where nature trods  
And I calculate that I'm worth my weight  
In goldenrods  
  
Lucky, lucky me  
I can live in luxury  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams


Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh,  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
Dashing through the snow  
In a one-horse open sleigh  
Through the fields we go  
Laughing all the way.  
Bells on bob-tail ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight.  
  
Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh, brruup  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
Dashing through the snow  
In a one-horse open sleigh  
Through the fields we go  
Laughing all the way.  
Bells on bob-tail ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight.  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh,  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh,  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh.


A clouded moon creeps across the clouded sky  
Winds of January sigh and moan  
And yet it's June.  
I can see a sky of blue  
Dear the miracle is due to you.  
Just you.  
It's June in January  
Because I'm in love  
It always is spring in my heart  
with you in my arms.  
The snow is just white blossoms  
that fall from above.  
And here is the reason, my dear,  
Your magical charms.  
The night is cold  
The trees are bare  
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air.  
It's June in January  
Because I'm in love.  
But only because I'm in love with you.  
  
Oh the night is cold!  
Won't it be too bare  
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air.  
It's June in January  
Because I'm in love  
But only because I'm in love with you.


There's a girl I'm wild about, every time I take her out  
I hurry, I scurry, I worry so  
And we always can be found, where there's no one else around  
If I lost her, what a blow, I love her oh-wo-oh  
Yes, I love her in the morning and I love her at night  
I love her, yes, I love her when the stars are shining bright  
I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last night on the backporch, I love her best of all  
Oh, I love her in the morning and I love her at night  
First time that I dug this chick, it was true love at first sight  
I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last time, gave her my frat pin, then I loved her best of all  
Oh, I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last night Maw went shopping and then I loved her best of all

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate to go out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


Oh, little Jack Frost get lost, get lost,  
Little Jack Frost get lost  
You know you don't do a thing  
But put a bite on the toes  
  
There's lots of cold feet all the lovers complain  
You turn up the heat down on lover's lane  
The bench in the park is alone in the dark  
So, little Jack Frost get lost, get lost,  
Little Jack Frost get lost  
  
So, little Jack Frost get lost, get lost  
Little Jack Frost get lost, get lost  
You don't do a thing but put the bite on my toes  
Freeze up the ground and take the bloom from the rose  
So, little Jack Frost go away, go away  
And don't you come back another day, get gone, go way  
  
There's lots of cold feet, all the lovers complain  
You turn off the heat down in lover's lane  
The fence in the park is all alone in the dark  
So, little Jack Frost get lost, get lost,  
Little Jack Frost get lost  
Get lost, get lost, get lost, get lost  
L. J. Frost get lost  
(Lost)


Blue night and you, alone with me  
My heart has never known such ecstasy  
Am I on earth, am I in heaven?  
  
Can it be the trees that fill the breeze with rare and magic perfume?  
Oh, no, it isn't the trees, it's love in bloom  
Can it be the spring that seems to bring the stars right into this room?  
Oh, no, it isn't the spring, it's love in bloom  
  
My heart was a desert  
You planted a seed  
And this is the flower  
This hour of sweet fulfillment  
  
Is it all a dream, the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom?  
You know it isn't a dream, it's love in bloom  
  
My heart was a desert  
But you planted a seed  
And this is the flower  
This hour of sweet fulfillment  
  
Is it all a dream, the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom?  
You know it isn't a dream, it's love in bloom


Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,  
Can't you see? Oh, you have captured me!  
Being so glamorous, now can't you be amorous just with me,  
Make it soon, Cop a look at that moon.  
  
Love is just around the corner,  
Any cozy little corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
When I'm around you.  
  
I'm a sentimental mourner,  
And I couldn't be forlorner,  
When you keep me on that corner,  
Just waiting for you.  
  
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,  
But strictly between us,  
You are cuter than Venus,  
And what's more you've got arms!  
  
Let's go cuddle in a corner,  
Any cozy little corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
And I'm around you.  
  
Love is just around the corner,  
Any cozy corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
When I'm around you.  
  
I'm ten times as faithful,  
As all your other men,  
They all are true to no one but you,  
But me I'm true to ten.  
  
Oh, let's go cuddle in a cozy corner,  
Any cozy little corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
And I'm around you.


Love thy neighbor,  
Walk up and say "How be ya  
Gee! But I'm glad to see ya, pal,  
How's tricks? What's new?"  
Love thy neighbor,  
Offer to share his burden,  
Tell him to say the word "n"  
You will see him through  
Especially if there should be  
a beautiful girl next door,  
Say to that girl next door,  
don't think I'm bold  
But my mother told me to  
Love thy neighbor  
And you will find your labor,  
A great deal easier,  
Life'll be breezier  
If you Love Thy Neighbor


Uh-huh, Uh-huh  
Lay way back you cats, Dig in  
Live a while, yes, Mr Mack is movin' in  
  
Though the shark has, pretty teeth, dear  
And he shows 'em pearly whites  
Just a jackknife has MacHeath, dear  
And he keeps it, well out of sight  
  
When the shark bites, with his teeth, dear  
Scarlet billows start to spread  
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, dear  
So there's not a trace of red  
  
On the sidewalk, Sunday mornin'  
Lies a body oo-oozin' life  
Someones sneakin' 'round the cor-or-orner  
Is that someone Mack the Knife?  
  
From a tugboat, by the river  
A cement bags drooppin' down  
The cement, that's just for the weight, dear  
I'll bet you Mackys back in tow-own  
  
Mr Miller, disappeared, dear  
After drawin' out all of his cash  
Went tap city, and MacHeath spends like a sailor  
Did our boy do, somethin' rash?  
  
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver  
Polly Peacham, Miss Lucy Brown  
Oh, the line forms on the right, dear  
Now that Mackys back in town


Oh, me name is MacNamara, I'm the leader of the band  
Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land  
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball  
And when we play the funerals, we play the March from Saul  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair  
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there  
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand  
Says he, "I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band"  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come  
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum  
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand  
They shout, "There's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band!"  
  
Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green  
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen  
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland  
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
That's MacNamara


You're mean to me  
Why must you be mean to me  
Dear, honey, it seems to me  
You like to see me cryin'  
  
I don't know why I stay home each night  
When you say you'll phone, you don't  
And I'm left alone singing the blues inside  
  
You treat me coldly  
Each day in a year  
You always call me  
Whenever somebody is near  
  
Dear, it must be great fun  
To be mean to me  
You shouldn't, for can't you see  
What you mean to me  
  
You treat me coldly  
Each day in a year  
You always call me  
Whenever somebody is near  
  
Dear, it must be great fun  
To be mean to me  
You shouldn't, for can't you see  
What you mean to me


Mexicali Rose stop crying  
I'll come back to you some sunny day  
Every night you'll know that I'll be pining  
Every hour a year while I'm away  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please don't sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me  
Mexicali Rose, goodbye  
  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please don't sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me  
Mexicali Rose, goodbye


Come to me my melancholy baby  
Cuddle up and don't be blue  
All your fears are foolish fancies, baby  
You know dear that I'm in love with you  
Every cloud must have a silver lining  
Wait until the sun shines through  
Smile, my honey dear while I kiss away each tear  
Or else I shall be melancholy too  
Every cloud must have a silver lining  
Wait until the sun shines through  
Smile, my honey dear while I kiss away each tear  
Or else I shall be melancholy too  


Now is the hour  
When we must say goodbye.  
Soon you'll be sailing  
Far across the sea.  
  
While you're away  
Oh, then, remember me.  
When you return  
You'll find me waiting here.  
  
Sunset glow fades in the west.  
Night o'er the valley is creeping.  
Birds cuddle down in their nest  
Soon all the world will be sleeping.  
  
Now is the hour  
When we must goodbye.  
Soon you'll be sailing  
Far across the sea.  
  
While you're away  
Oh, then, remember me.  
When you return  
You'll find me waiting here.


Adeste fideles  
Laeti triumphantes  
Venite, venite in Bethlehem  
  
Natum videte  
Regem angelorum  
Venite adoremus  
Venite adoremus  
Venite adoremus  
Dominum  
  
Oh, come, all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
Oh come, ye  
Oh come, ye to Bethlehem  
  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of angels  
Oh, come, let us adore him  
Oh, come, let us adore him  
Oh, come, let us adore him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
Oh, come, let us adore him  
Oh, come, let us adore him  
Oh, come, let us adore him  
Christ, The Lord


Oh, little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless  
Sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all  
The years are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep  
The angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
Oh, morning stars together  
Proclaim the Holy birth  
And praises sing  
To God the King  
And peace to men on Earth  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls  
Will receive him still  
The dear Christ enters in  
  
Oh, holy child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
We hear the christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emanuel


There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye,  
An' it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a beautiful mornin',  
Oh, what a beautiful day.  
I got a beautiful feelin'  
Ev'rything's goin' my way.  
  
All the cattle are standin' like statues,  
All the cattle are standin' like statues,  
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,  
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree,  
And a ol' weepin' willer is laughin' at me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, what a beautiful mornin',  
Oh, what a beautiful day,  
I got a beautiful feelin'  
Ev'rything's goin' my way.  
Oh, what a beautiful day


Ol' man river  
That ol' man river  
He don't say nothing  
But he must know something  
Cause he just keeps rolling  
He keeps rolling along  
Rollin' along  
He don't plant tators  
He don't plant cotton  
Them that plants 'em is soon forgotten  
But ol' man river  
He keeps rolling along  
You and me  
We sweat and strain  
Body all aching  
And wracked with pain  
Tote that barge  
Lift that bale  
Get a little drunk  
And you land in jail  
I gets weary  
Sick of trying  
I'm tired of living  
Feared of dying  
But ol' man river  
He's rolling along


I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore  
Leave all your lovers weeping on the faraway shore  
  
Out on the briny with the moon big and shinny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Out on the briny with the moon big and shinny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
On a slow boat to China, all to myself alone


Once in a while will you try to give  
One little thought to me  
Though someone else may be  
Nearer your heart?  
  
Once in a while will you dream  
Of the moments I shared with you  
Moments before we two  
Drifted apart?  
  
In love's smoldering ember  
One spark may remain  
If love still can remember  
That spark may burn again  
  
I know that I'll be contented  
With yesterday's memory  
Knowing you think of me  
Once in a while  
  
In love's smoldering ember  
One spark may remain  
If love still can remember  
The spark may burn again  
  
I know that I'll be contented  
With yesterday's memory  
Knowing you think of me  
Once in a while


(There's a pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
And I walk up and down 'neath the clock  
(By the pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
But I ain't got a thing left to hock  
  
She was peaches, she was honey, and she cost me all my money  
'cause a whirl 'round the town was her dream (was her dream)  
Took her dancin', took her dinin' till her blue eyes were shinin'  
With the sights that they never had seen (never seen)  
If you should run into a golden-haired angel  
And ask her tonight for a date  
She'll tell you somewhere there's a rich millionaire  
Who is calling again about eight  
  
(There's a pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
And I've just gotta get five or ten (five or ten)  
(From the pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
Gotta be with my angel again  
  
She was peaches, she was honey, and she cost me all my money  
'cause a whirl 'round the town was her dream (was her dream)  
(Took her dancin', took her dinin' till her blue eyes were shinin')

Gotta be with my angel again


Won't you play some simple melody  
Like my mother sang to me  
One with a good old fashioned harmony  
Play some simple melody  
  
Musical demon set your honey a dreaming  
Won't you play me some rag  
Just change that classical nag  
To some sweet beautiful drag  
If you will play from a copy  
Of a tune that is choppy  
You'll get all my applause  
And that is simply because  
I want to listen to rag


Round and round the Christmas tree  
Presents hanging there for you and me  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
  
A-ring around the Christmas tree  
Children making up a melody  
Grown-ups laughing happily  
Christmas a day away  
  
Wishing, hoping, boxes to open  
But we agree it's right to wait  
Turkey and dressing, after the blessing  
And there's just a night to wait  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Opening presents with the family  
One for you and two for me  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
  
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong,  
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong  
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Presents hanging there for you and me,  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
  
Wishing, hoping, boxes to open  
But we agree it's right to wait  
Turkey and dressing, after the blessing  
And there's just a night to wait  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Opening presents with the family  
One for you and two for me  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day


You know dasher and dancer and prancer and vixen  
Comet and cupid and donder and blitzen  
But do you recall  
The most famous reindeer of all  
  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
And if you ever saw it  
You would even say it glows  
  
All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games  
  
Then one foggy christmas eve  
Santa came to say  
Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?  
  
Then how the reindeer loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
You'll go down in history  
  
Hang your nose down rudy  
Hang your nose and cry


The leaves of brown came tumblin' down, remember  
In September in the rain  
  
The sun went out just like a dying ember  
That September in the rain  
  
To every word of love I heard you whisper  
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain  
  
Though spring is here, to me it's still September  
That September in the rain  
  
To every word of love I heard you whisper  
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain  
  
Though spring is here, to me it's still September  
That September in the rain  
That September in the rain


Small fry, struttin by the pool room  
Small fry, should be in the school room  
My, my put down that cigarette  
You ain't grown up high and mighty yet  
Samll fry, dancin for a penny  
Small fry, countin up how many  
My, my just jlisten here to me  
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea  
You practice peckin all day long to eome old radio song  
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes  
You better listen to your (maw, pay)  
and someday practice the law  
and then you'll be a real success  
Ys, small fry, (you) kissed the neighbor's daughter  
Small fry, (should) stay in shallow water  
Seems I should take you cross my knee  
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea  
You've got your feet all soakin wet  
You'll be the death of me yet  
Oh me, oh my, small fry  


Soft breeze, whispering trees  
The summer winds are sighing  
The leaves are lullabying  
Violins are all around you  
I can hear the chords resound  
Of sounding brass  
That seems to say I've found  
I've found you, I've found you.  
  
Strange music in my ears  
Only now as you spoke, did it start.  
Strange music of the sphere  
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?  
You appear and I hear song sublime  
Song that I'm incapable of.  
So Dear, let me hold you near  
While we treasure ev'ry measure,  
So that time can never change  
The strange, new music of love.  
  
So Dear, let me hold you near  
While we treasure ev'ry measure,  
So that time can never change  
The strange, new music of love.


Sunday, Monday or Tuesday  
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday  
I want you near  
Every day in the year  
  
Oh, won't you tell me when  
We will meet again  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
If you're satisfied  
I'll be at your side  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
No need to tell me now  
What makes the world go 'round  
When at the sight of you  
My heart begins to pound and pound  
  
And what am I to do  
Can't I be with you  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
Always and forever I must be with you  
Beginning Sunday and Monday and then forever  
  
Oh, won't you tell me when  
We will meet again  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
If you're satisfied  
I'll be at your side  
Sunday, Monday or always  
  
No need to tell me now  
What makes the world go 'round  
When at the sight of you  
My heart begins to pound, pound, pound  
  
What am I to do  
Can't I be with you  
Sunday, Monday or always


She just got here yesterday,  
Things are hot here now they say,  
There's a new gal in town.  
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt.  
All the guys just rave about  
Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.  
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.  
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.  
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
  
All you gals will get the blues,  
All you pals will surely lose.  
And, there's but one excuse.  
Now I've told you who she was,  
And I've told you what she does,  
Still, give this gal her dues.  
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown  
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.  
Fellas, won'tcha tip your hats.  
Oh boy, ain't she the cats?  
Who's that mister, ain't her sister, it's Sweet Georgia Brown.


Sweet you in the moonlight  
Sweet is the word for you  
For all that you have done for me  
The one for me is you  
  
Sweet you in the starlight  
Sweet is the word for you  
But all the stars that glow above  
Seem to know of my love for you  
  
Because of you the wind is wine tonight  
My heart sings with ev'ry beat  
Are you a dream here in the moonlight,  
Sweet is the word for you  
  
And yet you seem divine tonight,  
You're mine tonight  
My Sweet


Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew  
And then she placed them in a bower  
  
It was the start of you  
Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
I dreamed of paradise for two  
  
You are my paradise completed  
You are my dream come true  
  
Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
Tropic skies are jealous as they shine  
I think they're jealous of your blue eyes  
  
Jealous because you're mine  
Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
I dreamed of paradise for two  
  
You are my paradise completed  
You are my dream come true  
  
You are my paradise completed  
You are my dream come true


Everybody hand in hand  
Swingin' down the lane  
Everybody's feelin' grand  
Swingin' down the lane  
  
That's the time I miss that bliss  
That we might have known  
Nights like this when I'm all alone  
  
When the moon is on the rise  
Honey, I am so blue  
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes  
Like we used to do  
  
When the moon is on the way  
Still I'm waitin' all in vain  
Should be swingin' down that lane with you  
  
When the moon is on the rise  
Honey, I am so blue  
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes  
Like we used to do  
  
When the moon is on the way  
Still I'm waitin' all in vain  
Should be swingin' down that lane with you


Would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a mule  
  
A mule is an animal with long funny ears  
Kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny but his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And by the way, if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a pig  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He has no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a fish  
  
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook  
He can't write his name or read a book  
To fool the people is his only thought  
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
You could be swingin' on a star


We used to dwell in love's own palace  
A palace of dreams come true  
Now that we're through I bear no malice  
Though we've called it a day  
All I can say is  
Thanks for all the lovely delights  
I found in your embrace.  
I'm thankful though I know  
It's ending all too soon  
And thanks for unforgettable nights  
I never can replace  
And memories that linger like a haunting tune  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes it's better, for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our road, but still I must convey our thanks  
  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes, its better, for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our way but still I must convey my thanks


What do you say to the dead  
Will you forgive me for living  
Can't believe the things that they said  
Wonderful day for a killing  
It's killing me  
  
What do they do with your soul  
Is it just lying there busted  
When did you lose all control  
Is there someone to be trusted  
With my mind  
  
Oh there's insufficient evidence  
Of what just might come after  
But sometimes out of nowhere  
There's demented sounds of laughter  
  
Are we all haunted by  
The ghost - imagination  
It just can't be  
I've seen them there  
Howling at the moon  
  
Is it just me  
Or does somebody else believe this  
Well I'm not alone  
And I'm not afraid  
There's just one way to see  
  
Chorus:  
After all etc.  
  
What do you say to the dead  
Is there a place where it's burning  
It says in a book I once read  
Yes there's a chance of returning  
Turn to me  
  
The fundamental principles  
Say nothing of forever  
But those are voices that I hear  
Or I'm just not so clever  
  
It can't be me  
I know somebody else believes this  
Well I'm not alone  
I'm not afraid  
Just one way to see  
  
After all etc.


Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?  
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave  
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?  
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?  
  
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?  
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a
fool?  
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways  
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days  
  
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say  
If they knew you believe in God above?  
They should realize before they criticize  
that God is the only way to love  
  
Is your mind so small that you have to fall  
In with the pack wherever they run  
Will you still sneer when death is near  
And say they may as well worship the sun?  
  
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ  
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced  
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?  
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve  
  
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone  
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one  
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate  
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.


She sits in silence, in her midnight world  
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls  
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time  
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind  
  
In days of romance  
She was the queen of dance  
She'd dance the night away  
  
And as the seasons turn the days to years  
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers  
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen  
And now she dances only in her dreams  
  
In days of romance  
She was the queen of dance  
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away


Everybody's looking at me, feeling paranoid inside  
When I step outside I feel free, think I'll find a place to hide  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  
Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be  
Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see  
So tell me people, am I going insane?  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  
So I'm telling all you people, listen while I sing again  
If I don't sound very cheerful, I think that I'm a schizophren  
So tell me people, am I going insane?  
Tell me people, am I going insane?  


I'm just another back street kid  
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig  
Can't stop the music going round inside my head  
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead  
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me  
  
Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine  
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been  
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room  
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom  
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me  
  
Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going  
Got to see yourself in other's eye's, surprised?  
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying  
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise  
  
Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land  
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands  
So listen to the music, want to see you get so high  
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die  
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me


What is this that stands before me?  
Figure in black which points at me  
Turn around quick, and start to run  
Find out I'm the chosen one  
Oh nooo!  
  
Big black shape with eyes of fire  
Telling people their desire  
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling  
Watches those flames get higher and higher  
Oh no, no, please God help me!  
  
Child cries out for his mother  
Mother's screaming in the fire  
Satan points at me again  
Opens the door to push me in  
Oh nooooo!  
  
Is it the end, my friend?  
Satan's coming 'round the bend  
people running 'cause they're scared  
The people better go and beware!  
No, no, please, no!


Revolution in their minds - the children start to march  
Against the world in which they have to live  
And all the hate that's in their hearts  
They're tired of being pushed around  
And told just what to do  
They'll fight the world until they've won  
And love comes flowing through  
  
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today  
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?  
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?  
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?  
  
So you children of the world,  
Listen to what I say  
If you want a better place to live in  
Spread the words today  
Show the world that love is still alive  
You must be brave  
Or you children of today are  
Children of the Grave, Yeah!


In the misty morning, on the edge of time  
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign  
As the misty morning rolls away to die  
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky  
  
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly  
We thought that it could never end  
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run  
Now it seems our world has come undone  
  
Oh they say that it's over  
And it just had to be  
Ooh they say that it's over  
We're lost children of the sea, oh  
  
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played  
Hiding in our corner of the world  
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore  
Threw away the key and locked the door  
  
Oh they say that it's over, yeah  
And it just had to be  
Yes they say that it's over  
We're lost children of the sea  
  
In the misty morning, on the edge of time  
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign  
As the misty morning rolls away to die  
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky  
  
Oh they say that it's over, yeah  
And it just had to be  
Oh they say that it's over  
Poor lost children of the sea, yeah  
  
Look out! The sky is falling down!  
Look out! The world is spinning round and round and round!  
Look out! The sun is going black, black  
Look out! It's never never never coming back, look out!


Born in a graveyard adopted by sin  
I cultivate evil that's living within  
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul  
Possessed by a demon that had full control  
  
The time it is coming when all life will end  
With doomsday approaching to hell we'll descend  
Religion won't save me, the damage is done  
The future has ended before it's begun  
  
Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day  
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray  
God of the almighty never answers their call  
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him  
  
I don't mind dying 'cause I'm already dead  
Pray not for the living I'll live in your head  
Dying is easy it's living that's hard  
I'm losing the battle between Satan and God


Can you hear, the people sing their song,  
To tunes of glory, they move as one.  
Refugees of liberation marching on,  
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.  
  
When you take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's  
Left is humanity.  
  
It's getting closer, change is bound to come.  
There's someone out there, holding candles to the  
Sun.  
Then an answer, says that peace will come around,  
Stand in line, take your time and be proud.  
  
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is  
Humanity,  
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you  
And me.  
  
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,  
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.  
  
Refugees of liberation marching on,  
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.  
  
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is  
Humanity,  
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you  
And me.  
  
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,  
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.  
  
Hear them call you, dying for love, those who know  
You, dying for love.  
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners,  
Dying for love,  
Dying for love.


Hello, can you hear me? I might not be alone  
Don't see anyone near me but I just won't go home again  
Let's meet in the morning, I just can't speak tonight  
This is more than a warning, be silent 'till it's light  
  
And then you know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me  
Remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl  
I've seen an ear in the wall  
  
This time, it could prove it but you've heard this all before  
Cry wolf and you're moving to a special kind of danger zone  
I need a witness, somebody just like you  
So bring an exorcist, a wizard and the holy ghost  
  
You know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me  
Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl  
I've seen an ear in the wall  
  
One more reason, one more time  
Someone's searching through my mind  
Now where am I supposed to go  
It's not who you are, it's who you know  
What's it gonna be?  
  
I knew you would answer, I'm the curiosity  
You could miss a chance because the fool might see reality  
There it is, in the corner, you must be going blind  
What's wrong? Were you born before your God invented eyes?  
  
It's got to be there, grinding away at my secrets  
It's growing so dark and you can't see it all  
I'll turn on some lights so you're sure not to fall  
It's next to the eye in the wall


Reflex in the sky warn you you're gonna die  
Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide  
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties  
Turns people into clay, radiation minds decay  
  
Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage  
Plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon  
Dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration  
Burning globe of oxy'n fire, like electric funeral pyre  
  
Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground  
Rivers turn to wood, ice melting to flood  
Earth lies in death bed, clouds cry water dead  
Tearing life away, here's the burning pay  
  
Electric Funeral  
Electric Funeral  
Electric Funeral  
Electric Funeral  
  
And so in the sky shines the electric eye  
Supernatural king takes earth under his wing  
Heaven's golden chorus sings, Hell's angels flap their wings  
Evil souls fall to Hell, ever trapped in burning cells!


Goin' home, late last night  
Suddenly I got a fright  
Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw  
A fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf,  
All right now!  
  
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies  
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes,  
Oh all right now!  
  
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies  
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes,  
All right now!  
  
So I went to the doctor  
See what he could give me  
He said Son, son, you've gone too far.  
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do.


Step back and look at you, and tell me that is what you want to be,  
You realise that what you're seeing, is a replica of me.  
Inside my world is pretty grim, that even I can't survive in,  
I wouldn't try 'cause I know you.  
  
Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell.  
Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell.  
  
You realise that what you're seeing is just a replica of me,  
Only me.  
  
Oh it makes no difference if you're the only one,  
It doesn't matter when all is said and done,  
Gonna feel the same, God will put the blame on you.  
Oh yeah.  
  
If I was you, If I was you,  
I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see inside my head,  
I'd wanna know if I was fuckin dead,  
I'd wanna know what's going on,  
Someone tell me the truth.  
  
There's no fear in a fallen Angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone,  
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming,  
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell.  
There's no fear in a fallen Angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone,  
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming.  
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell.  
You're guilty.


Whatcha gonna do?  
Time's caught up with you  
Now you wait your turn  
You know there's no return  
  
Take your written rules  
You join the other fools  
Turn to something new  
Now it's killing you  
  
First it was the bomb  
Vietnam napalm  
Disillusioning  
You push the needle in  
  
From life you escape  
Reality's that way  
Colours in your mind  
Satisfy your time  
  
Oh you, you know you must be blind  
To do something like this  
To take the sleep that you don't know  
You're giving death a kiss, oh, little fool now  
  
Your mind is full of pleasure  
Your body's looking ill  
To you it's shallow leisure  
So drop the acid pill,  
  
Don't stop to think now  
  
You're having a good time baby  
But that won't last  
Your mind's all full of things  
You're living too fast  
  
Go out enjoy yourself  
Don't bottle it in  
You need someone to help you  
To stick the needle in, yeah  
  
Now you know the scene  
Your skin starts turning green  
Your eyes no longer seeing  
Life's reality  
  
Push the needle in,  
Face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin,  
Caused by deadly pin  
  
Head starts spinning 'round  
You fall down to the ground  
Feel your body heave  
Death's hands starts to weave  
  
It's too late to turn  
You don't want to learn  
Price of life you cry  
Now you're gonna die!


I'm looking through a hole in the sky  
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie  
I'm getting closer to the end of the line  
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine  
  
I'm living in a room without any view  
I'm living free because the rent's never due  
The synonyms of all the things that I've said  
Are just the riddles that are built in my head  
  
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven  
Window in time, through it I fly  
  
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun  
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun  
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars  
I don't believe there's any future in cause  
  
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven  
Window in time, through it I fly  
Yeah  
  
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast  
I've seen the western world go down in the east  
The food of love became the greed of our time  
But now I'm living on the profits of pride


So you lie awake and think about tomorrow,  
And you try to justify the things you've done,  
But there's no one here, to hear your tears falling,  
When you turn around, you find out, that you're the lonely one.  
  
And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,  
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure,  
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.  
  
So I won't cry for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you,  
And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you.  
Ain't gonna cry for you.  
  
So you lie awake and think about the sorrow,  
Does it really still the fears in your mind,  
And you try to realise the things you wanted,  
But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind.  
  
And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,  
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure,  
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.  
  
So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you,  
And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you.  
Ain't gonna cry  
  
I ain't gonna cry for you, I ain't gonna cry.  
  
So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you,  
No I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you,  
Ain't gonna cry, ain't gonna cry for you no more,  
Ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna die for no more,  
Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie for no more,  
  
Ain't gonna cry, I ain't gonna cry for you no more.


There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air  
And the blood in my vein's running colder.  
The Eastern sky is beginning to silver  
And the words that you speak start to falter.  
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,  
In the house of the dead there's a taker.  
Some say that this is the ultimate sin  
When the spirit world turns to the alter.  
  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
  
Behold the dead, clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever  
"In glory die" calls the voice from the void  
You assasin has cursed every spectre  
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,  
And the house of the dead seeks the master  
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end  
And the kiss on the wind whispers murder, (murder)  
  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
  
When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain  
Blood kill in the spirit world ah  
  
Did ya see another in black  
Is the blood in your veins running colder?  
If ya did, then there's no turing back  
As the spirit world turns to the alter.  
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,  
And the house of the dead seeks the master  
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end  
And a kiss on the wind whispers murder  
  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
  
Oh here it comes, no no no-oh oh  
Your seal is broken, the Eastern sky is beginning to silver, oh oh oh.  
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air, ah.  
You feel the evil, I feel the evil.  
Oh somebody whispers murder.  
  
A kiss on the wind whispers murder


It's a long way to nowhere  
And I'm leaving very soon  
On the way we pass so close  
To the back side of the moon  
Hey join the traveler if you got nowhere to go  
Hang your head and take my hand  
It's the only road I know  
Oh! Lonely is the word, yeah yeah yeah!  
I've been higher than stardust  
I've been seen upon the sun  
I used to count in millions then  
But now I only count in one  
Come on, join the traveler  
If you got nowhere to go  
Hang your head and take my hand  
It's the only road I know  
Yeah, lonely is the word  
Got to be the saddest song I ever heard  
Yeah, lonely is the name  
Maybe life's a losing game


You're searching for your mind don't know where to start  
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart  
You think you know but you are never quite sure  
Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure.  
  
Your world was made for you by someone above  
But you chose evil ways instead of love.  
You made me master of the world where you exist  
The soul I took from you was not even missed.  
  
Lord of this world  
Evil possessor  
Lord of this world  
He's your confessor now!  
  
You're searching for your mind don't know where to start  
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart  
You think you know but you are never quite sure  
Your soul is I'll but you will not find a cure  
  
Your world was made for you by someone above  
But you choose evil ways instead of love  
You made me master of the world where you exist  
The soul I took from you was not even missed  
  
Lord of this world  
Evil possessor  
Lord of this world  
He's your confessor now!  
  
You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear  
You don't know me you say, but isn't it clear?  
You turn to me in all your wordly greed and pride,  
But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die?.


I hide myself inside the shadows of shame  
The silent symphonies were playing their game  
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul  
This god is something that I could not control  
  
Where can I run to now?  
The joke is on me  
No sympathizing god is insanity, yeah  
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?  
Why don't you just get out of my life now?  
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?  
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?  
  
Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes  
I mixed reality with pseudogod dreams  
The ghost of violence was something I seen  
I sold my soul to be the human obscene  
  
How could this poison be,  
The dream of my soul  
How did my fantasies take complete control, yeah?  
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah?  
Why don't you just get out of my life now?  
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?  
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah?  
  
Well I feel something's taken me I don't know where  
It's like a trip inside a separate mind  
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream  
Is telling me to leave it all behind  
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow  
Got to get to happiness, want no more of sorrow  
  
How I lied, went to hide  
How I tried to get away from you now  
Am I right if I fight?  
That I might just get away from you now  
Sting me!  
  
Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return  
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul  
Beating the demigod, I'm fading away  
I'm going backwards but I'm in control  
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow  
Getting back to sanity, providence of sorrow  
  
Was it wise to disguise  
How I tried to get away from you now  
Is there a way that I could pay  
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?  
  
How I lied, went to hide  
How I tried to get away from you now  
Am I right if I fight?  
That I might just get away from you now  
Suck me!  
  
I'm really digging schizophrenia the best of the earth  
I've seized my soul in the fires of hell  
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it's all mine  
I set the trap, but it was me who fell  
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow  
Now I've found my happiness, providence of sorrow  
  
No more lies, I got wise  
I despise the way I worshipped you yeah  
Now I'm free, can't you see  
And now instead I won't be led by you now  
Free!


Oh yeah!  
  
Some people say my love cannot be true  
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you  
I will give you those things you thought unreal  
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Follow me now and you will not regret  
Leaving the life you led before we met  
You are the first to have this love of mine  
Forever with me 'till the end of time  
  
Your love for me has just got to be real  
Before you know the way I'm going to feel  
I'm going to feel  
I'm going to feel  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Now I have you with me, under my power  
Our love grows stronger now with every hour  
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am  
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Follow me now and you will not regret  
Leaving the life you led before we met  
You are the first to have this love of mine  
Forever with me 'till the end of time  
  
Your love for me has just got to be real  
Before you know the way I'm going to feel  
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!  
  
Now I have you with me, under my power  
Our love grows stronger now with every hour  
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am  
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand


Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight  
The silence is over, he's shattered the night  
No other hunter has the power or the grace  
He is the master of this place  
  
Tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
So listen my friend  
Nightwing flies again  
  
They say he comes for those whose souls are weak  
And call his name upon the wind  
The night is cold and thick with mystery  
Oh I can feel his beating wings  
  
Tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
Nightwing flies again  
  
Tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
Nightwing flies again  
  
Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight  
The silence is over, he's shattered the night  
Life ain't for giving and forgiving ain't free  
No soul will rest while the hunted run free  
  
So tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
Listen my friend  
Nightwing flies again


I wish somebody would empty my head  
I am so sorry for the things that I've said  
This hopeless feeling that's living inside  
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find  
Some peace of mind  
  
I ain't no hero who's gonna save you  
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through  
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride  
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find  
Some peace of mind  
  
Read in between the lines  
Truth that is neither black nor white  
Black nor white  
Just give me something real  
Broken man still searching for the light  
In the night  
  
Caught In the middle as the front line falls  
It looks like I don't stand a chance  
If only I could turn my life around  
Or is this just the circumstance


You've seen life through distorted eyes  
You know you had to learn  
The execution of your mind  
You really had to turn  
The race is run the book is read  
The end begins to show  
The truth is out, the lies are old  
But you don't want to know  
  
Nobody will ever let you know  
When you ask the reasons why  
They just tell you that you're on your own  
Fill your head all full of lies  
  
The people who have crippled you  
You want to see them burn  
The gates of life have closed on you  
And now there's just no return  
You're wishing that the hands of doom  
Could take your mind away  
And you don't care if you don't see again  
The light of day  
  
Nobody will ever let you know  
When you ask the reasons why  
They just tell you that you're on your own  
Fill your head all full of lies  
You bastards!  
  
Where can you run to  
What more can you do  
No more tomorrow  
Life is killing you  
Dreams turn to nightmares  
Heaven turns to hell  
Burned out confusion  
Nothing more to tell  
  
Everything around you  
What's it coming to  
God knows as your dog knows  
Bog blast all of you  
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  
Nothing more to do  
Living just for dying  
Dying just for you


Man of madness who lives in my head  
Keeping me awake at night he sits on my bed  
He drives me crazy, he won't go away  
Playing his game every night and everyday, yeah-ah  
  
My mind feels heavy, my body feels weak  
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep  
Impending doom is what I'm about  
Think I'm going mad without a shadow of doubt  
  
I search for serenity yeah  
Is it really out there?  
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere  
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control  
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul  
Selling My Soul  
  
I search for serenity yeah  
Is it really out there?  
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere  
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control  
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul  
Selling My Soul  
  
Yeah-ah  
For Selling My Soul  
Yeah-ah  
Selling My Soul  
Yeah-ah  
For Selling My Soul


I've been gone a long long time, waiting for you  
I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no  
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?  
I wanted you to be my wife  
  
The days are passing slowly, since you've gone  
Your memories are all I have, yes I have  
I sit here waiting but you'll never show  
Without you I can't carry on, oh my baby  
  
You said you'd always love me, all of my life  
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye  
Why the sudden changes, why all the lies?  
I should have seen it in your eyes  
  
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you  
My summer love has turned to rain, all the pain  
The silent emptiness of one sided love  
My life means nothing now you're gone, ooh my baby


I am the crazy man  
Who lives inside your head  
But I think I'm breaking through the wall  
  
You are the innocent  
Convicted of the crime  
No one was ever there  
To catch you when you fall  
  
I see the diamonds  
But you only see the rock  
I need to run  
But you only crawl  
  
It's time to open up  
All the doors that you keep locked  
Nobody gives without a take  
Let's take it all  
  
You've been twisted into pieces  
By the hands of your emotions  
How much longer are you gonna pay  
For yesterday  
Sins of the father  
  
One more crucifixion  
One more cross to bear  
You're a hole in a photograph  
  
Go on lose it in the city  
The city can feel no shame  
See the world with electric eye  
  
They call it mystery  
But any fool could see  
You thought he walked on the water  
  
And if the pain was gone  
And you were free to run away  
And get out  
  
Would you get out of there  
Or do you really care  
It's not safe or easy  
And maybe when you're gone  
You just won't belong at all  
  
You're the only witness  
To the murder of an angel  
How much longer are you gonna pay  
For yesterday  
Sins of the father  
  
It's just another crucifixion  
One more cross to bear  
Go on lose it in the city  
Take a look at the world  
You've got electric eyes


The way I feel is the way I am  
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you  
Just to you  
  
What kind of people do you think we are?  
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you  
Just for you  
  
The faithful image of another man  
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you  
Yeah for you  
  
The shot troopers laying down on the floor  
I wish they'd put an end to my running war with you  
Yeah with you  
  
Are you metal, are you man?  
You've changed in life since you began  
Yeah began  
  
Ladies digging gold from you  
Will they still dig now you're through  
Yeah you're through  
  
You bought and sold me with your lying words  
The voices in the deck that you never heard came through  
Yeah came through  
  
Your folly finally got to spend with a gun  
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son, that's you  
Yeah that's you  
  
I beg you please don't let it get any worse  
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you  
Yeah curse you  
  
All of the promises that never came true  
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true  
Ah, that's true  
  
Are you Satan, are you man?  
You've changed in life since it began  
It began  
  
Vultures sucking gold from you  
Will they still suck now you're through  
  
(Cats, Rats)  
  
The search is on, so you just better run  
And find yourself another way  
Probably dead, they don't feel a thing  
To keep them living for another day  
  
(Rats, Rat)  
  
You are nonentity, you have no destiny  
You are a victim of a thing unknown  
A mantle picture of a stolen soul  
A fornication of your golden throne  
  
A smiling face, it means the world to me  
So tired of sadness and of misery  
  
My life it started some time ago  
Where it will end, I don't know  
I thought I was so good  
I thought I was fine  
I feel my world is out of time  
  
But everything is gonna work out fine  
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind  
  
I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know  
Listen to me while I sing this song  
You might just think the words are wrong  
Too many people advising me  
But they don't know what my eyes see  
  
But everything is gonna work out fine


Well, I don't want no Jesus freak to  
Tell me what it's all about  
No black magician telling me  
To cast my soul out  
Don't believe in violence  
I don't even believe in peace  
I've opened the door  
Now my mind has been released  
  
Well I don't want no preacher  
Telling me about the god in the sky  
No I don't want no one to tell me  
Where I'm gonna go when I die  
I wanna live my life, I don't want  
People telling me what to do  
I just believe in myself  
'Cause no one else seems true  
  
Every day just comes and goes  
Life is one long overdose  
People try to rule the nation  
I can see through their frustration  
  
People riding their real peace  
keep on running their rat race  
Behind each flower there grows a weed  
In their world of make-believe  
  
So believe what I tell you  
It's the only way to fight in the end  
Just believe in yourself you know you really  
shouldn't have to pretend  
Don't let those empty people  
Try and interfere with your mind  
Just live your life  
And leave them all behind


Say you don't know me, you'll burn  
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me  
Say you don't want me, you'll learn  
Nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through  
  
Call me a liar, you knew  
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right  
Call me the Devil, it's true  
Some can't accept but I crept inside you  
  
So if a stranger calls you  
Don't let him whisper his name  
'Cause it's Voodoo, oh!  
  
Fade into shadow, you'll burn  
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good  
Never look back, never turn  
It's a question of time 'till your mine and you learn  
  
So if a stranger sees you  
Don't look in his eyes  
'Cause he's Voodoo!  
  
Say you don't know me, you'll burn  
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me  
Say you don't want me, you'll learn  
Nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through  
  
Voodoo!  
  
Bring me your children, they'll burn!  
Never look back, never turn!  
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo!!


Who Are You  
  
  
Yes I know the secret  
That's within your mind  
You think all the people  
Who worship you are blind  
You're just like Big Brother  
Giving us your trust  
And when you have played enough  
You'll just cast our souls  
Into the dust  
Into the dust  
  
You thought that it would be easy  
from the very start  
Now I've found you out  
I don't think you're so smart  
I only have one more question  
Before my time is through  
Please I beg you tell me  
In the name of hell  
Who are you?  
Who are you?


The world today is such a wicked thing  
Fighting going on between the human race  
People give good wishes to all their friends  
While people just across the sea are counting the dead  
  
A politician's job they say is very high  
For he has to choose who's got to go and die  
They can put a man on the moon quite easy  
while people here on earth are dying of old diseases  
  
A woman goes to work every day after day  
She just goes to work just to earn her pay  
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder  
he doesn't even know who is his father


(Die young)  
Go to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all,  
Your back's to the wall  
  
Then chase the sun, n it tears away and breaks you as you run, you run, you
run  
  
Behind the smile, there's danger n a promise to be told, you never get old  
Life's fantasy, to be locked away n still you think you're free, you're free,
we're free  
  
So live for today tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young die young  
Can't you see the writting in the air  
Die young gonna die young  
Someone stopped the faith  
  
Go to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Then chase the sun, n it tears away n it breaks you as you run you run you run  
  
Live for today tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young  
Young  
Die young  
Young die you die young  
Young  
Die young die young die young die young


Astral engines in reverse  
I'm falling through the universe again  
Down among a dead mans vision  
Faded dreams and nuclear fissions span  
  
The strings of fear they are holding up the race  
The puppets falling to the ground  
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space  
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found  
  
On this sinking ship I travel  
Faster than the speed of life  
Not so super nova burns  
The black holes turn and fade from sight  
  
The strings of fear they hide within the human race  
The answers buried underground  
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space  
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found  
  
And very soon  
The boundless moon  
Will show us light  
And as we crash  
We'll pray and kiss  
And say goodnight  
Goodnight


Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you  
It's all served up on a gold plated plate  
And we don't even have to talk to you  
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred  
And that's the way you're going to stay  
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel  
But someone else's finger's on the control panel  
  
What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero  
Don't you want to be brother - Zero the hero  
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero  
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero  
  
You sit there watch it all burn down  
It's easy and breezy for you  
You play your life to a different sound  
No edge no edge you got no knife have you  
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere  
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there  
Where the heroes sit by the river  
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver  
  
You stand there captain we all look  
You really are mediocre  
You are the champion in the Acme form book  
But I think you're just a joker  
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity  
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around  
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing  
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing


Picked up the girl  
And he sailed around the world  
Why not?  
What else have you got?  
  
If you're not  
Anyone that I like  
Love Will give me the moon  
Whoops  
  
And beyond these voices  
And danced on the groove  
In a dream forever  
Starts when you wake up  
  
Starts when you wake up  
Picked up the girl  
And he sailed around the world  
What?  
  
Oh yeah sorry  
Around the world  
Why not?  
What else has he got?  
  
I don't know  
And I know  
I don't know  
Love will give me the moon  
  
Oh dear  
And beyond these voices  
And danced on the groove  
In a dream forever  
  
Starts when you wake up  
Starts when you wake you


I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of,  
No I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No I ain't got  
Anything to be scared of  
?Cos I love you  
  
I was born out of love  
It's the only way to come into this world  
I know I'm not all there  
But I'm getting, getting, getting there  
If you let me live my life  
I'll stay with you to the end  
And I know, lord  
I'm nearly there  
I want to tell you this  
  
I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of, no  
No I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of, no  
No I ain't got  
Anything to be scared  
Cause I love you  
  
I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of  
  
I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared of  
No I ain't got  
Nothing to be scared  


So far I've not really stayed in touch  
Well you knew as much it's no surprise that today  
I'll get up around two from a lack of anything to do  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
  
And you have not really stayed in touch  
Well I knew as much it's no surprise that today  
I'll get up around two with nothing to do  
Except get a touch of flu  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case I'd rather wear it  
It's like a badhead in the morning  
  
And I know  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case I'd rather wear it  
It's like a badhead in the morning  
  
So I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case I'd rather wear it  
Your like a badhead in the morning  
  
And I know


Sitting in an S.D.T.  
Waiting for an underground train  
To rumble underneath my feet  
  
Bang goes another day  
Where it went I could not say  
Now I'll have to wait another week  
  
When all is said and all is done  
What was said was never done  
Don't panic, it's not really worth your while  
  
Bang goes another year  
In and out of one ear  
Everybody's doing it, so do it too  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't need anyone  
But a little love would make things better  
But a little love would make things better  
  
Sitting on the early bus  
Passing through the morning rush  
It makes no difference that I'm not with you  
  
Bang goes another year  
In and out of one ear  
Everybody's doing it, so do it too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't need anyone  
But a little love would make things better  
I don't need anyone  
But a little of your love can make things better


Grandma has got new dentures  
To eat the crust on pizza  
Been taken out by her daughter  
Because she thought she ought'a  
The kids are eating snickers  
Because they're so delicious  
Then there's sticky fingers  
And mother looses her knickers  
  
[Chorus]  
Bank holiday comes six times a year  
Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers  
Bank holiday comes with a six package beer  
Then its back to work a.g.a.i.n.  
  
Bar-b-que is cooking  
Sausages and chicken  
The patio is buzzing  
The neighbors they are looking  
John is down the fun pub  
Drinking lots of lager  
Girls and boys are on the game  
All the high streets look the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back to work a.g.a.i.n.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bank holiday


This is a ballad for the good times  
So put a battery in your leg  
Put a rock beat over anything  
Get it stuck there in your head  
You can be with me  
  
I got nothing to rely on  
I've broken every bone  
Everybody's stop believing  
But you know you're not alone  
You can be with me  
  
This is a ballad for the good times  
And all the dignity we had  
Don't get het up on the evil things  
You ain't coming back  
You can be with me  
If you want to be  
You can be with me?


Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle  
Battle Someone. . .oooh

Completion Search  
Here I love the bow  
See me walk on down to  
Adorn myself, it's a new song glory  
Cos. see me, what do you think of now?  
  
Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle

Take your last one now  
  
Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle  
Battle Someone. . .oooh  
Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle, Battle  
Battle Someone. . .oooh  


The point at which you looked at me  
Has always being part of my brain  
Now my mind is in a whirl  
And it seems  
  
I am not the same  
My dear and special friend  
There's never a point at which we ever loved  
I'm in mine, and mine is fine  
  
I'm wrapped up in shining days  
Blackbirds in summer time  
They find a low  
I end up being you  
  
My dear and special friend  
There's never a point at which we ever loved  
The point at which I looked at you  
Has always being part of my brain  
  
Now my mind is in a whirl  
And it seems  
I am not the same  
My dear and special friend  
  
There's never a point at which we ever loved


Beetlebum  
What you've done  
She's a gun  
Now what you've done  
Beetlebum  
Get nothing done  
You beetlebum just get numb  
Now what you've done  
Beetlebum  
  
And when she lets me slip away  
She turns me on all my violence is gone  
Nothing is wrong  
I just slip away and I am gone  
Nothing is wrong  
She turns me on  
I just slip away and I am gone  
  
Beetlebum  
Because you're young  
She's a gun  
Now what you've done  
Beetlebum  
She'll suck your thumb  
She'll make you come  
Coz, she's your gun  
Now what you've done  
Beetlebum  
  
And when she lets me slip away  
She turns me on all my violence is gone  
Nothing is wrong  
I just slip away and I am gone  
Nothing is wrong  
She turns me on  
I just slip away and I am gone


Bow bells say goodbye to the last train  
Over the river they all go again  
Out into leafy nowhere hope someone  
Waiting out there for them  
Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun  
He works nights but it's not much fun  
Picks up the London yo-yo's, all on their own down Soho  
Please take me home  
  
Other people wouldn't want to hear you  
If you said that these are the best days of their lives  
Other people would turn around an d laugh at you  
If you said that these were the best days of our lives  
  
Trellick Tower's been calling  
I know she'll leave me in the morning  
  
In hotel cells listening to dial tones  
Remote controls and cable moans  
In his drink he's been talking  
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home


Put away my black book  
Throw it on the fire  
Getting out the side door  
You are my one desire  
Baby when you hold me  
I feel see you're everything  
Baby when you touch me  
I need nothing no more  
Put away my black book  
  
Put in on the fire  
Don't give up on me Lord  
Take my spirit higher  
Nothing can behold me  
  
Don't put me on the fire  
Baby when you hold me  
I will see no fear  
Baby when you touch me  
You see it in my eyes  
Put away my black book  
  
Put it on the fire  
I've made up my mind  
I got nothing to hide  
I've made up my mind  
I got nothing to hide  
  
Give me my soul [Repeat: x7]  
Give you my soul  
Give me my soul  
Give you my soul [Repeat: x10]  
Give you  
Give you my soul [Repeat: x4]


Air cushioned soles  
I bought them on the Portbello Road on a Saturday  
I stop and stare awhile  
A common pastime when conversation goes astray  
  
And don't think I'm walking out of this  
She don't mind  
Whatever I say, whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
  
Blue, blue jeans I wear them every day  
There's no particular reason to change  
My thoughts are getting banal, I can't help it  
But I won't pull out hair another day  
  
And don't think I'm walking out of this  
She don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
If you don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
  
You know it's to be with you  
Don't give up on me yet  
Don't think I'm walking out of this  
She don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
If you don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
  
You know it's to be with you


When you see in see you dancing  
Own reflection was never bent  
Be a man can shaking bone bag  
One day up is another down  
I don't want to hurt you, no not ever  
No not ever  
This is my street, I stay here and sleep  
You're outside on sunny days  
Nicotine flow stops a pain grow  
Stay a while, so nearly there  
I don't want to hurt you, no not ever  
No not ever  
This is my street I stay here and sleep  
You're outside on sunny days  
Be a man can shaking bone bag  
One day up is another day  
I don't want to hurt you, no not ever  
No not ever


I am an ex offender  
They let me out in the summer

I didn't know what to do  
Oh no

He makes an inner arm block  
Then kicks off from behind  
The lights they go off  
But he can fight blind  
Cause he got the touch  
But he won't live long  
Cause he comes from Hong Kong  
Where people are strong  
  
Chinese bombs, millions jump,  
Chairman's junk USA  
Won't somebody, won't somebody  
Sink this place  
  
Got a cab to go to Soho  
The dragon says go  
Let everyone know  
You got the touch  
You come from Hong Kong  
Where people are strong  
And you won't live long  
  
Chinese bombs, millions jump  
Chairman's junk, USA  
Won't somebody, won't somebody  
Bruce Lee comes to save the day  
Bruce Lee comes to save Chinese way  


Gonna sail a bird like a private jet  
You're the one, you're the one  
In my head, oughta get us clear  
You'll find a song before too long  
I've got a healthy feeling,  
A sleepy feeling, a sleepy feeling  
Today is gone, the day is gone, today is gone  
Go to a store, to the golf floor  
A cowboy's song, a cowboy's song  
You're the one, you're the one  
A cowboy's song, you're the one  
I've got a healthy feeling,  
A sleepy feeling, a sleepy feeling  
It's all gone, today is gone, it's all gone  
I've got a sleepy feeling,  
A new slept feeling, a sleepy feel  
It's all gone, today is gone, today is gone


Meanie Leanie come on down  
Come and entertain the town  
It's friday night and we're all bored  
Time's been called there is no more  
Time's been called it's such a bore  
  
Dan Abnormal not normal at all  
It's not his fault we made him this way  
He'll imitate you try to ape you  
But it's not his fault Dan watches T.V.  
  
The meanie Leanie stays up late  
Mopes around gets in a state  
He the killer in your arcade  
Killing gangstas ready made  
Cause that is where the future's made  
  
Tele port me  
  
Dan went to his local burger bar  
I want McNormal and chips  
Or I'll blow you to bits  
Give us it  
  
It's the miseries at half past three  
Watching video nasties  
He has dirty dreams while he's asleep  
Dan's just like you and me  
He's the Meanie Leanie  
  
Dan Abnormal not normal at all  
It's not his fault we made him this way  
He'll imitate you try to ape you  
But it's not his fault Dan Abnormal's me


The death of the party  
Came as no surprise  
Why did we bother?  
Should have stayed away  
Another night  
And I thought "Well, well"  
Go to another party and hang myself  
Gently on the shelf  
The death of the teenager  
Standing on his own  
Why did he bother?  
Should have slept alone  
Another night  
And I thought "Well, well"  
Go to another party and hang myself  
Gently on the shelf  
Another night  
And I thought "Well, well"  
Go to another party and hang myself  
Gently on the shelf


I pump poison  
Into my body  
To forget  
That I am me  
  
feels good  
Wonderful  
I forget I have feelings at all  
You're dizzy  
  
I floated up  
Fifteen miles high  
Stuck my head through  
All the holes in our sky  
  
I looked out across the universe  
And thought of you  
You're dizzy  
And I am dizzy too  
  
I became lunatic  
With rolling eyes  
Squirming on the ground  
Frozen in ice  
  
Called to my mother  
Said "Mother, please  
Feed me before the sky  
Falls in on me"  
  
You're dizzy


You and me we try  
to change  
  
We try so hard it's all the same  
I'm just waiting for it to begin again  
Ahhhh  
I'm forgetting who I am  
That makes me wonder who I am  
Trying so hard to find sense when there's none at all  
Ahhh  
Down  
Staring at the sun all day  
If you stare too long you get burned away  
Now there's nothing left of me so have it all  
Ahhh  
Forgetting again I blame  
My past has just faded away  
Now I can tell you everything there is to know about  
Ahhh  
Down


This isn't the first time  
I've left it too late  
To get on top  
I made that mistake  
To be with someone  
Never find what you need  
We don't bail out  
And I can't sleep.  
  
You left me  
Just when I needed you  
You set me back  
Just when I thought I got back  
(Whistle, Do do do's, La la la's)  
Just when I thought I got back.  
  
This is the last time  
I make this mistake  
Can't see the stars  
Yeah it's too late  
To be with someone  
Never find what you need  
We don't bail out  
Yeah I can't sleep


They stumbled into their lives  
In a vague way became man and wife  
One got the other they deserved one another  
They settled in a brand new town  
With people from the same background  
They kept themselves busy  
Long hours left them dizzy  
Now when he's in she's out  
  
All you ever do is fade away  
They are not making plans  
Because now they understand  
All you ever do is fade away  
  
He noticed he had visible lines  
She worried about her behind  
Their birth had been the death of them  
It didn't really bother them  
Now when she's in, he's out


Sorry, but I don't understand  
The things you say they make no sense at all  
Funny but I think that you mean them all  
This time don't you  
  
I know that you think I'm a fool  
But couldn't you try to forgive a fool  
One more time  
  
Sorry but I'm not really listening  
I've got my mind on something else if I'm here  
If I'm here at all  
I know that you want me to go don't you  
But it's not as easy as it seems  
I know that you think I'm not here at all  
But I'm just as fed up as you  
  
I know that you want me to leave  
I'm amazed at how cold you can be  
Well may my weak and insipid soul grow stronger in your absence


Wake up straight, caught out by the sun.  
On the first day of April.  
Out of bed, thought there was a plane crash.  
But I'm sure that I was  
Dreaming  
TV on, of course caffeine.  
A science of submission again  
Another day, on this little island, just a bell hangs on.  
  
Porridge done, I take my kid to school past the pound shop, Woolworth's  
Under bridge, where the subway the daytime, and the Westway flies by  
Then on my bike, down the Ladbroke Grove, to the forthcoming dramas  
A studio, and a love of all sweet music, we just can't let go  
Let go, let go, let go, let go  
  
So meditate, on what we've all become, on a cold day in springtime  
Civil war, is what were all born into, raise your left hand, right, sing.  
Don't capitulate to the forces of the marketplace, they've long departed  
Consolidate, the love we have together, on a cold day in springtime.


He's a twentieth century boy  
With his hands on the rails  
Trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
London ice cracks on a seamless line  
He's hanging on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
La, la la l-la, la, la la, l-la l-la la-la-la  
La, la la l-la, la, la la, l-la l-la la-la-la  
La, la la l-la, la, la la, l-la l-la la-la-la  
Holding on for tomorrow  
  
She's a twentieth century girl  
With her hands on the wheel  
Trying not to be sick again  
Seeing what she can borrow  
London's so nice back in your seamless rhymes  
But we're lost on the West way  
So we hold each other tightly  
And we can wait until tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
She's a twentieth century girl  
Holding on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
(Jim stops and gets out of the car  
Goes to a house in Emperor's Gate  
Through the door and to his room, and then he puts the TV on  
Turns it off and makes some tea  
Says modern life is rubbish)  
I'm holding on for tomorrow  
  
(Then Susan comes into the room  
She's a naughty girl with a lovely smile  
Says, 'let's take a drive to Primrose Hill  
It's windy there, and the view's so nice.'  
London ice can freeze your toes, like anyone, I suppose)  
You're holding on for tomorrow


Oh you are so very strange  
Sometimes I think you've gone insane  
Twisted hearts you've gone insane  
In this giddy world  
Couldn't you begin to go  
Where odd lines we hardly know  
Couldn't you put in a goal  
Just for me  
  
Did I say I want to know  
Talking about a goal  
Would you please leave me alone  
Can't you see I want to be on my own  
  
Oh, I would like to give you your head  
Just to see if you are dead  
Oh, I'd like to get into that pretty head  
And it would amuse me just to see  
How you feel about me  
How you feel about always getting fried  
  
Did I say I want to know  
We're talking about a goal  
Would you please leave alone  
Can't you see I want to be on my own  
Can't you see I want to be on my own  
  
Oh,I'm going to fly [Repeat: x 3


I got a brain in left hand drive  
I don't asleep other side  
I ride a bullet like I'm Steve McQueen  
Each town I intervene  
A gram of keef and the barn is jumping  
It's alright we got time  
Got a radio hit in mind  
Can't see am I blind  
  
Every night and day  
In the U.S.A?..I DELETE MYSELF  
  
Got to know you gene by gene  
You're my jellybean  
Get out the shower  
And I'm force 15  
I'm dead I'm clean  
Fatboy and the barn is jumping  
It's alright it's just tight  
  
GOT to GET into A better Business  
DEEP down Happiness


Moscow's still red  
The young man's dead  
Gone to heaven instead  
The evening news says he was confused  
The motorways will all merge soon  
Lottery winner buys the moon  
They've come to save us  
The space invaders are here  
  
He thought of cars  
And where, where to drive them  
And who to drive them with  
And there, there was no one, no one  
  
There's panic at London Heathrow  
Everybody wants to go up into the blue  
But there's a ten year queue  
Columbia is in top gear  
It shouldn't snow at this time of year  
Now America's shot gone  
And done the lot  
  
He thought of planes and where,  
Where to fly to  
And who to fly there with  
And there, there was no one, no one


When you come here  
Which you sometimes do  
Don't think that I really want you to  
  
When you come here  
Which you always do  
Don't think that I expect you to  
  
Is that all I give you  
You talk too much  
Which you sometimes do  
Don't think that I really want you to  
  
And you talk too much  
But you always do  
Don't think that I really need you to  
Is that all I give you  
  
Is that all I give


I always knew that there would be someone somewhere  
Who had it in for me  
I always knew that there would be no-one nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
I'm all over  
All over  
All over  
I'm the only one  
I'm hanging around  
Going nowhere  
Waiting for it to happen to me  
I always knew that there would be no-one nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
I'm all over  
All over  
All over  
You're the only one  
I always knew that there would be someone somewhere  
Who had it in for me  
I always knew that there would be no-one nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
I'm all over  
All over  
All over  
You're the only one


Your man is always flaming  
He's hitting his head against the wall  
He do it to you  
He do it again, he knows to do  
I've always found you complicated  
A boy tried to shut you up  
I do what I do  
I do it again, again, again  
And I'd like you to know  
It's alright  
There's a world around us  
I need you to know  
I'm alright  
No need to worry about me  
'Cause I'm just fine  
Your man has lost his meaning  
Smash his head against the wall  
He do it to you  
He do it again  
He's coming back to you  
You give me the strangest feeling  
You shut me of myself  
You do it to me  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
And I'd like you to know  
It's alright  
There's a world around us  
I need you to know  
I'm alright  
No need to worry about me  
'Cause I'm just fine  
I'm just, I'm just fine  
And I'd like you to know I'm alright  
It's a world around us  
I need you to know  
I'm alright  
No need to worry about me  
'Cause I'm just fine  
I'm just fine  
I'm just fine  
I'm just fine


I heard a man who had no lungs  
He took me in and made me lunch  
He told me how I'd lost my friend  
He smiled at me it was the end  
I said  
  
I'm just a killer for your love  
I'm just a killer for your love  
I'm just a killer for your love  
I'm just a killer for your love  
  
I cut my hair off in the road  
I take my coat off dropped my load  
I wipe my hands on the grass  
Cause I know that nothing ever lasts  
And I said  
  
I'm just a killer for your love  
I'm just a killer for your love  
I'm just a killer for your love  
I'm just a killer for your love


It starts feeling now  
It makes no inference of difference  
It still won't see it's his  
Faint from lack of air  
It makes a whistle with a twistle  
But no one can hear  
I didn't stay long  
I had to go away to stay  
As long as I could  
So I'm happy here  
Cause here is where the heart is  
I know you think that too  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead?  
Sleep in Harlow's bed  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead?  
Sleep in Harlow's bed  
Listening to our tune  
With headphone and volume on  
I can read your lips  
And in a clinical term  
"I hear," it said  
"Everything is beautiful, but nothing hurt"  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead?  
Sleep in Harlow's bed  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead  
Sleep in Harlow's bed


Churchill got his lucky number  
But tomorrow there's another  
Could be me could be you  
No silver spoon  
Sticky teeth they rot too soon  
You've got to have the best tunes  
Or that's it you've blown it  
  
All we want is to be happy  
In our homes like happy families  
Be the man on the beach with  
The world at his feet  
Yes, it could be you  
  
The likely lads  
Are picking up the uglies  
Yesterday they were just puppies  
Beery slurs now life's a blur  
Telly addicts  
You should see them at it  
Getting in a panic  
Will we be there  
Trafalgar Square?  
  
So don't worry  
If it's not your lucky number  
Because tomorrow there is another  
Could be you, could be me


Jubilee slouches in the settee  
He's losing all will to move  
He gone divy too much telly  
He watching 24 hours of rubbish  
He got butane he got plastic bags  
His eyes are going square oh yeah  
He no raver just anti social  
He not going to cut his hair  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen, he not mean  
Enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen,he not keen on  
Being like anyone else  
  
Jubilee's dad billy banker  
He thinks his son is a slob  
He should get out more stop scabbing  
He really should go and get a job  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not mean enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him where to go  
But he just don't get out enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him talk to girls  
But he's just too spotty  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not keen on being like anyone else  
So he just plays on his computer games  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not mean enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him where to go  
But he just don't get out enough  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him talk to girls  
But he's just too spotty  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not keen on being like  
Anyone he's not being like  
Anyone jubilee's not like  
Anyone else


One night, half a dozen tourists met together in Trafalgar Square  
A fourth nights tour on the continent was planned  
And each had his portmento in his hand  
Down the Rhine they ment to have a picnic to Joan siad I must decline  
The boys are being advised by me  
Stay away from Germany  
What's the good of going down the Rhine  
  
Chorus:  
Let's all go down the strand  
Let's all go down the strand  
I'll be leader, You can march behind  
Come with me and see what you can find  
Let's all go down the strand  
Oh what a happy land  
That's the place for fun and noise  
All amoung the girls and boys  
So let's all go down the strand  
  
One day 5 and 20 convicts  
Satted by their 20 little cells  
The bell then sounded ding-a-ding-a-dong  
To exercise the prisoners came along  
Buggler Ben exclaimed to Jacks The Warden  
To me sir, It's very strange  
The men are tired of going round  
Round and round the same old ground  
I purpose we make a little change  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Gray crowds gathered round to welcome  
Shackleton returning from the poll  
The Lord Mayor welcomed all the galant crew  
And said my lads, I've got a treat for you  
Come with me, The mansion house awaits you  
A banquet shall be supplied  
But a towering, grumbling mood  
Said we don't want any food  
Then he turned to Shackleton and sighed  
  
Repeat chorus (x2)


A malady has taken him over  
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor  
The lights are magic  
And he feels lucky  
And he's got money  
Shoots like an arrow, oh  
  
London loves  
The mystery of a speeding car  
London loves  
The misery of a speeding heart  
  
It's love you like and everyone's at it  
And words are cheap when the mind it elastic  
He loves the violence  
Keeps ticking over  
So sleep together  
Before today is sold forever  
  
London loves  
The way people just fall apart  
London loves  
The way you just don't stand a chance  
London loves  
The misery of a speeding heart  
  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
  
London loves  
The mystery of a speeding car  
London loves  
The misery of a speeding heart  
London loves  
The mystery  
  
Oh, hey, hey  
London loves  
The way people just fall apart  
London loves  
The way we just don't stand a chance  
London loves (always London loves!)  
The speeding heart


[Verse 1]  
What do you got?  
Mass produced in somewhere hot  
You'll have to go on the Underground  
To get things done here  
And then you have  
[?] service done  
This is a place to come to, or, well, it was  
I know a hot spot  
Crossing on the guillotine  
  
[Chorus]  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift  
It's got to be that time again  
And you, you will be over soon again  
  
[Verse 2]  
So get yourself up, get past [?] on your way  
There's nothing to be ashamed of  
Taking off again  
The 514 to East Grinstead  
You've set me off  
[?]  
And talking types will let us down  
Talk, talk on your arse all night  
You wanna be there  
  
[Bridge]  
Step inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that time forgot  
Oh, we're just gonna go there  
Cracks inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that crime forgot, oh no  
  
[Outro]  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street


Good morning lethargy  
Drink pepsi it's good for energy  
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom  
Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise  
And where it came from, well I don't know  
But we played last night, it was a good show  
  
Got the play out, second rate chat show  
It's a nation wide deal, so we gotta go  
Chap from the company says it will be alright  
Got an add on KRO  
And there's an in-store tonight  
Well I built things up  
And then I let them go  
Got to get time share on the radio  
  
Look inside America, she's alright, she's alright  
Sitting out the distance  
But I'm not trying to make her mine  
Looking for America  
With its kooky nights and suicide  
Where the TV says it's alright  
Coz' everybody's hung up on something or other  
  
Steppin' off in 20, so the driver says  
I should sleep tonight  
But I think I'll watch videos instead  
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end  
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again  
And the whole world could have passed through me  
But I don't know if it means much to me  
  
Look inside America  
She's alright, she's alright  
Sitting out the distance  
But I'm not trying to make her mine  
I'm looking for America  
With its kooky nights and suicide  
Where the TV says it's alright  
Coz everybody's strung out on something or other  
  
And the whole world  
Could have passed through me  
But I don't know if it means much to me


The trees are spinning oxygen  
They're the rockets we should fear  
If we go and let them off then we will disappear  
Then we will disappear, surely we will disappear  
  
The road is hot and dusty  
The desert needs a beer  
But if we go and blow it up then we will disappear  
Then we will disappear, surely we will disappear  
If we go and blow it up then we will disappear  
We will disappear surely  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  


Here we go (here we go) here we go again  
Dirty knickers pop music vodka and gin  
Your knees are sore you must?ve been in the wars  
There's something to celebrate in our lives and  
here's where it begins  
Oh well see how we've grown  
One is born every minute  
you're never never alone  
One is born - every minute of the day  
Dosey clocks to cause the volatile tots to  
Sleep together if or never we're on this then  
Oh here we go, here we go, here we go again  
Dirty knickers pop music vodka beer and gin  
Oh well see how we've grown  
One is born every minute  
you're never never alone  
One is born - every minute of the day


Where's the love song to set us free  
Too many people down  
Everything turning the wrong way round  
And I don't know what life would be  
If we stop dreaming now  
Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds  
  
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time  
To open up your mind  
And watch the world spinning gently out of time  
Feel the sunshine on your face  
It's on a computer now  
Gone to the future way out in space  
  
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time  
To open up your mind  
And watch the world spinning gently out of time  
  
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time  
To open up your mind  
And watch the world spinning gently out of time  
  
Tell me I'm not dreaming  
But are we out of time  
We're out of time  
Out of time  
Out of time  
Out of time  
Out of time


Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur  
Of what is known as  
(Parklife)  
And morning soup can be avoided  
If you take a route straight through what is known as  
(Parklife)  
  
John's got brewers croop he gets intimidated  
By the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of him  
(Parklife)  
Who's that gut lord marching?  
You should cut down on your porklife mate, get some exercise  
  
All the people  
So many people  
They all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their parklife  
Know what I mean?  
  
I get up when I want except on Wednesdays  
When I get rudely awakened by the dustman  
(Parklife)  
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea  
And I think about leaving the house  
(Parklife)  
  
I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too  
It gives me a sense of enormous well-being  
(Parklife)  
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day safe in the knowledge  
There will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife  
  
Parklife  
(Parklife)  
Parklife  
(Parklife)  
  
It's got nothing to do with  
Vorsprung durch technique you know  
(Parklife)  
And it's not about you joggers  
Who go round and round and round  
(Parklife)  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife


Now I fall to the ground  
I can't get up, well never mind  
I know you'll pull me up by my bones  
And say I'm sand to polished stone  
Today's gone and it won't be long  
Before we fall asleep and forget what we've done  
We won't get up 'cause today is fun  
We're alone  
  
Now you bite my tongue  
And when the alcohol's gone  
I won't feel a thing  
So you can't carry on  
  
Today's gone and it won't be long  
Before we fall asleep and forget what we've done  
We won't get up 'cause today is fun  
We're alone  
  
It's numb

Woo-hoo

Woo-hoo  
  
I got my head checked  
By a jumbo jet  
It wasn't easy  
But nothing is  
No  
  
Woo-hoo  
When I feel heavy-metal  
(Woo-hoo)  
And I'm pins and I'm needles  
(Woo-hoo)  
Well, I lie and I'm easy  
All the time but I'm never sure  
Why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  
  
I got my head down  
When I was young  
It's not my problem  
It's not my problem  
  
Woo-hoo  
When I feel heavy-metal  
(Woo-hoo)  
And I'm pins and I'm needles  
(Woo-hoo)  
Well, I lie and I'm easy  
All the time but I am never sure  
Why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  
  
Yeah yeah

Unemic birth-er  
Gets in the way-ey  
He never earns her  
  
Wohoo  
'Cause he did run it easy  
Wohoo  
If I will do the same  
Wohoo  
'Cause you're sick and you're easy  
All that you get when you ever say  
'Cause you're never  
pleased to see me  
  
I never taught her  
And 'cause how easy  
She's not my problem  
It's not my problem  
  
Wohoo  
'Cause I know what my name is  
Wohoo  
And I go on again  
Wohoo  
If you ever regret it  
You don't say what you never deem  
'Cause you're never  
pleased to see me  
  
Oh Yeah x4

The Universal is free  
You can find it anywhere  
Yes, the future has been sold  
Every night we are gone  
And to karaoke songs  
We like to sing along  
Although the words are wrong  
  
It really, really, really could happen  
Yes, it really, really, really could happen  
When the days seem to fall straight through you  
Just let them go  
  
No one here is alone  
Satellites in every home

(Tracy Jacks) it's a golfing fanatic  
(Tracy Jacks) but his put is erratic  
(Tracy Jacks) saw a harley street doctor  
(Tracy Jacks) who prescribed healthy living  
(Tracy Jacks) but he's getting past forty  
(Tracy Jacks) and all the seams are splitting  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But it's just so overrated

(Tracy Jacks) threw his clothes in the water  
(Tracy Jacks) and ran around naked  
(Tracy Jacks) got stopped by the police  
(Tracy Jacks) and escorted back home

I am the message centre  
Local and direct  
Room to room  
An operator  
(No calls today, dear  
They'll just have to wait, dear)  
I call  
And I collect  
(So just strike him softly  
Away from the body)  
You're made up too shiny today  
There's so much trouble  
Your thoughts are just  
Pissing away  
It's so much trouble  
I am a manager  
And I am in control  
As the local delegator  
(No calls today, dear  
They'll just have to wait, dear)  
I offer no guarantee at all  
(So don't take it lightly  
You passed your sell-by date)  
You're made up too shiny today  
It's so much trouble  
Your thoughts are just  
Pissing away  
It's so much trouble  
A new typeface  
A new day  
It's so much trouble  
You can't remember ten minutes ago  
It's so much trouble  
Too much trouble


Uncle Love just got a message from God  
That you are driving him crazy  
Tomorrow he says the doctor comes  
With a drink to make him lazy  
  
Did you realize that Uncle Love's  
Got an eight ball in his hand  
Everything sticks to you like glue  
But it just makes you lazy  
  
You should hear what they say  
About you everyday  
You should hear what they say  
Uncle Love's going to get you

There were blue skies in my city today  
Everything was sinking  
Said snow would come on Sunday  
The old school was due and the traffic grew  
Upon the Westway  
Where I stood watching comets lonesome trails  
Shining up above me the jet fuel it fell  
Down to earth where the money always comes first  
And the sirens sing  
  
Bring us the day they switch off the machines  
'Cause men in yellow jackets putting adverts inside my dreams  
An automated song and the whole world gone  
Fallen under the spell of the distance between us when we communicate  
Still picking up shortwave  
Somewhere they're out in space  
It depends how you're wired when the night's on fire  
Under the Westway  
  
Now it's magic arrows hitting the bull  
Doing one eighty still standing at last call  
When the flags coming down  
And the Last Post sounds  
Just like a love song  
For the way I feel about you  
Paradise not lost it's in you  
On a permanent basis I apologize  
But I am going to sing  
  
Hallelujah  
Sing it out loud and sing it to you  
Am I lost out at sea  
'Til a tide wash me up off the Westway


We have a random on the west side  
Personality malfunction  
He says I can't give you anything at all  
Just a room with a bad view of you  
  
He sent a letter to a downstat  
Saying sorry that I missed you  
But I can't think of anything to do  
He's addicted to the time track  
  
Oo-oo-oo, we have a technical (x2)  
  
He's in the hotel where they all go  
Saying me, I've lost my memory  
It's so surprising just how quickly things can end  
Like a hero on a platform of friends  
  
This table is so crowded  
With people that I don't know  
And I never really turn my thoughts on you  
So the image breaks down again  
  
Oo-oo-oo, we have a technical (x2)  
  
I suppose it's very shady  
At least until the lights go out  
Advertising posters on the wall  
And the young ones singing softly  
  
Do they ever come back (do they ever come back)  
Or is it always at the wrong time (is it always at the wrong time)  
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real  
And move a hand in front of my eyes  
  
Oo-oo-oo, we have a technical (x6)


Good morning  
Wake up  
  
Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency  
Stuff vitamin pills down your half guarantee  
A kiss and cuddle with a lucky girl  
You get fed and watered  
Makes your hair curl  
  
And when the day draws in  
You put on a record  
Put on something gentle  
And wait for the cows to come home  
  
Wake up a little voice says  
Do you eagerly  
You mustn't let yourself sink financally  
Don't listen to the accusation that you're tight  
You could be the first man on your street to get it right  
  
And when the day draws in  
You going to go into waltz time  
For once it was good time  
Wait for the cows to come home  
  
Ha da de da da  
Ha da de da da  
Ha da de da da  
Ha da de da da da  
  
Wake up in porpuse and polite efficiency  
So you get fed and watered with good company  
And when the day draws in  
You go into waltz time  
Wait for the cows to come home  
All your life


When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"  
I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, "What else you got left?"  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, "Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get."  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, "Don't get cute."  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, "No, dear."  
I said, "Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum."  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.


How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.


By Bob Dylan  
  
Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
Come on brother, join the band,  
Come on sisters, clap your hands,  
Tell everybody that's in the land,  
You ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
Brown and blue and white and black,  
All one color on the one-way track,  
We got this far and ain't a-goin' back  
And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
I ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
We're gonna notify your next of kin,  
You're gonna raise the roof until the house falls in.  
If you get knocked down get up again,  
We ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
I ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
We'll sing this song all night long,  
Sing it to my baby from midnight on.  
She'll sing it to you when I'm dead and gone,  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more.  
  
Well, I ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more, no more  
I ain't a-gonna grieve no more


By Bob Dylan  
  
Well, if I had to do it all over again,  
Babe, I'd do it all over you.  
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years,  
Babe, I'd even do that too.  
Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley,  
A cat, she's got nine lives,  
A millionaire's got a million dollars,  
King Saud's got four hundred wives.  
Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'  
That they're lookin' forward to.  
I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again  
And babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,  
Babe, I'd run circles all around.  
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.  
When my time arrives you better run for your life  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny,  
Baby, and my days are gonna come.  
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant  
When you hear me yellin', "Fee-fi-fo-fum."  
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,  
You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.  
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady  
A-doin' what I want to do,  
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late  
And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf.  
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there  
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.  
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,  
After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.  
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.


My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
"Oh, please put me away,"  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?


Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
And his cabin brokin' down.  
  
You looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
You looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they don't know how to smile.  
  
Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve  
Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and wonder why  
With every breath you breathe.  
  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
If there's anyone that knows  
Is there anyone that cares?  
  
You prayed to the Lord above  
Oh please send you a friend  
You prayed to the Lord above  
Oh please send you a friend  
Your empty pocket tell you  
That you ain't a-got no friend.  
  
Your babies are crying louder now  
It's pounding on your brain  
Your babies are crying louder now  
It's pounding on your brain  
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you  
Like the dirty drivin' rain.  
  
Your grass is turning black  
There's no water in your well  
Your grass is turning black  
There's no water in your well  
Your spent your last lone dollar  
On seven shotgun shels.  
  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shortgun  
That's hangin' on the wall.  
  
Your brain is a-bleedin'  
And your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain is a-bleedin'  
And your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shortgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand.  
  
There's seven breezes a-blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes a-blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the ocean's pounding roar.  
  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
There's seven new people born.


One evening for pleasure I rambled to view  
The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
"Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?".  
  
"Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle".  
  
"Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.  
  
I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle".


Oh well, I love you pretty baby  
You're the only love I've ever known  
Just as long as you stay with me  
The whole world is my throne  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing we can call our own  
  
Well, I'm moving after midnight  
Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said


Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you


I woke in the mornin', wand'rin',  
Wasted and worn out.  
I woke in the mornin', wand'rin',  
Wasted and worn out.  
Wishin' my long-lost lover  
Will walk to me, talk to me,  
Tell me what it's all about.  
  
I was standin' at the side road  
Listenin' to the billboard knock.  
Standin' at the side road  
Listenin' to the billboard knock.  
Well, my wrist was empty  
But my nerves were kickin',  
Tickin' like a clock.  
  
If I got anything you need, babe,  
Let me tell you in front.  
If I got anything you need, babe,  
Let me tell you in front.  
You can come to me sometime,  
Night time, day time,  
Any time you want.  
  
Sometimes I'm thinkin'  
I'm too high to fall.  
Sometimes I'm thinkin'  
I'm too high to fall.  
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm  
So low I don't know  
If I can come up at all.  
  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway.  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway.  
Though it's funny, honey,  
I just don't feel much like a  
Scarecrow today.


Seen the arrow on the doorpost  
Saying, "This land is condemned  
All the way from New Orleans  
To Jerusalem. "  
I traveled through East Texas  
Where many martyrs fell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing  
As they were taking down the tents  
The stars above the barren trees  
Were his only audience  
Them charcoal gypsy maidens  
Can strut their feathers well  
But nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
See them big plantations burning  
Hear the cracking of the whips  
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming  
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships  
I can hear them tribes a-moaning  
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell  
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
There's a woman by the river  
With some fine young handsome man  
He's dressed up like a squire  
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand  
There's a chain gang on the highway  
I can hear them rebels yell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, God is in heaven  
And we all want what's his  
But power and greed and corruptible seed  
Seem to be all that there is  
I'm gazing out the window  
Of the St. James Hotel  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell


How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you can call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
Yes, how many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
Yes, how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it's washed to the sea?  
Yes, how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
Yes, how many times can a man turn his head  
Pretending he just doesn't see?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
Yes, how many times must a man look up  
Before he can really see the sky?  
Yes, how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
Yes, how many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.


Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto  
They are ridin' down the line  
Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles  
Ev'rybody's 'cept mine  
Somebody musta tol' 'em  
That I was doin' fine  
  
Oh you five and ten cent women  
With nothin' in your heads  
I got a real gal I'm lovin'  
And Lord I'll love her till I'm dead  
Go away from my door and my window too  
Right now  
  
Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track  
See no sports car run  
I don't have no sports car  
And I don't even care to have one  
I can walk anytime around the block  
  
Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me  
Up and down the street  
With my hat in my hand  
And my boots on my feet  
Watch out so you don't step on me  
  
Well, lookit here buddy  
You want to be like me  
Pull out your six-shooter  
And rob every bank you can see  
Tell the judge I said it was all right  
Yes!


While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.


By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, "I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. "  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
"Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. "  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.


Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel,  
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel.  
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.  
  
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke,  
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke,  
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been sold.  
  
Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord,  
Lordy, Lord.  
  
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees,  
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees,  
I ain't cryin' for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.  
  
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,  
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,  
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.  
  
Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord,  
Lordy, Lord.  
  
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?  
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?  
Now you hear me tappin', tappin' across your floor.  
  
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,  
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all.  
What make me love my woman, she can really do the Georgia Crawl.  
  
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,  
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,  
If you're a real hot momma, come take away Daddy's weeping spell.


By Bob Dylan  
  
I'm goin' down south,  
'Neath the borderline.  
I'm goin' down south,  
'Neath the borderline.  
Some fat momma  
Kissed my mouth one time.  
  
Well, I needed it this morning  
Without a shadow of doubt.  
My suitcase is packed,  
My clothes are hangin' out.  
  
San Francisco's fine,  
You sure get lots of sun.  
San Francisco is fine.  
You sure get lots of sun.  
But I'm used to four seasons,  
California's got but one.  
  
Well, I got my dark sunglasses,  
I got for good luck my black tooth.  
I got my dark sunglasses,  
And for good luck I got my black tooth.  
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin',  
I just might tell you the truth.


He sits in your room, his tomb with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursin' the dead that can't answer him back  
You know he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.


Wise men say only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you.  
Shall I stay, will it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you?  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.  
Take my hand, take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you.  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.  
Take my hand, take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you.


Lazy stadium night  
Catfish on the mound.  
"Strike three," the umpire said,  
Batter have to go back and sit down.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm  
But the old man wouldn't pay  
So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An' one day he just ran away.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Come up where the Yankees are,  
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,  
Smoke a custom-made cigar,  
Wear an alligator boot.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Carolina born and bred,  
Love to hunt the little quail.  
Got a hundred-acre spread,  
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Reggie Jackson at the plate  
Seein' nothin' but the curve,  
Swing too early or too late  
Got to eat what Catfish serve.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Even Billy Martin grins  
When the Fish is in the game.  
Every season twenty wins  
Gonna make the Hall of Fame.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.


Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.


How'd ya like to spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to spend the holiday  
Away across the sea?  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to hang a stocking  
On a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late  
Like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail  
In with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true

Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust  
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is  
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made him a killer  
That's what they did.  
  
He was on the basketball team, he was in the marching band  
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said, "Listen boy, you're just a pup"  
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.  
  
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills  
A jeep to drive, blood to spill.  
  
They said, "Congratulation, you got what it takes"  
They sent him back into the race without any brakes.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt  
Only game he could play was Russian Roulette.  
  
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread  
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.  
  
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole  
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar  
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.  
  
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust.  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about.  
  
He had a steady job, he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him That's what they did.


After a while we took in the clothes,  
Nobody said very much.  
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants  
Which nobody really wanted to touch.  
Mama come in and picked up a book  
An' Papa asked her what it was.  
Someone else asked, "What do you care?"  
Papa said, "Well, just because."  
Then they started to take back their clothes,  
Hang 'em on the line.  
It was January the thirtieth  
And everybody was feelin' fine.  
  
The next day everybody got up  
Seein' if the clothes were dry.  
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,  
Mama, of course, she said, "Hi!"  
"Have you heard the news?" he said, with a grin,  
"The Vice-President's gone mad!"  
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night."  
"Hmm, say, that's too bad!"  
"Well, there's nothin' we can do about it," said the neighbor,  
"It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget."  
"Yes, I guess so," said Ma,  
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.  
  
I reached up, touched my shirt,  
And the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"  
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em."  
He said, "Ya always help out around here with the chores?"  
I said, "Sometime, not all the time."  
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose  
Just as papa yelled outside,  
"Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes."  
Well, I just do what I'm told,  
So, I did it, of course.  
I went back in the house and Mama met me  
And then I shut all the doors.


Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil  
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak  
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too  
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.


Just like old Saxophone Joe  
When he's hot ,the hogshead up on his toe  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
Listen to the fiddler play  
When he's playin' 'til the break of day  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime  
What do I care?  
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum  
Call me for dinner,  
Honey, I'll be there.  
  
Saddle me up on my big white goose  
Tie me on 'er turn her loose  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
I don't need much and that ain't no lie  
Ain't runnin' any race  
Give to me my country pie  
I won't throw it up in anybody's face.  
  
Shake me up that old peach tree  
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.


Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith  
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony I didn't want to have to
be dealin' with  
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I don't carry dead weight - I'm no flash in the pan  
All right, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?  
I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Feel like a fighting rooster - feel better than I ever felt  
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to
melt  
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls  
It must have been Don Pasquale makin' a two a.m. booty call  
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control  
Some people they ain't human, they got no heart or soul  
Well, I'm crying to The Lord - I'm tryin' to be meek and mild  
Yes, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, there's preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs  
I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs  
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey - I'll die before I turn senile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way  
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day  
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial  
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile


Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside  
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide  
I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.


Dear landlord,  
Please don't put a price on my soul.  
My burden is heavy,  
My dreams are beyond control.  
When that steamboat whistle blows,  
I'm gonna give you all I got to give,  
And I do hope you receive it well,  
Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please heed these words that I speak.  
I know you've suffered much,  
But in this you are not so unique.  
All of us, at times, we might work too hard  
To have it too fast and too much,  
And anyone can fill his life up  
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please don't dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue,  
I'm not about to move to no other place.  
Now, each of us has his own special gift  
And you know this was meant to be true,  
And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

Denise, Denise,  
Gal, what's on your mind?  
Denise, Denise,  
Gal, what's on your mind?  
You got your eyes closed,  
Heaven knows that you ain't blind.  
  
Well, I can see you smiling,  
But oh your mouth is inside out.  
I can see you smiling,  
But you're smiling inside out.  
Well, I know you're laughin'  
But what are you laughin' about.  
  
Well, if you're tryin' to throw me,  
Babe, I've already been tossed.  
If you're tryin' to throw me,  
Babe, I've already been tossed.  
Babe, you're tryin' to lose me.  
Babe, I'm already lost.  
  
Well, what are you doing,  
Are you flying or have you flipped?  
Oh, what are you doing,  
Are you flying or have you flipped?  
Well, you call my name  
And then say your tongue just slipped.  
  
Denise, Denise,  
You're concealed here on the shelf.  
Denise, Denise,  
You're concealed here on the shelf.  
I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe,  
And all I can see is myself.


Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide  
Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
Well, I been praying for salvation  
Laying round in a one-room country shack  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
'Til there's nothing left to see  
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed  
But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above  
looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above  
Rolling through the rain and hail  
Looking for the sunny side of love  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name


There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right down the highway straight down the line  
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind  
Nothing about it that's sweet  
The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.


I wish I was in the land of cotton  
Old times there are not forgotten  
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land  
  
[Chorus]  
In Dixie Land where i was born  
Early on one frosty morn  
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land  
  
I wish I was in Dixie  
Away, away  
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand  
To live and die in Dixie  
Away, away, away down south in Dixie  
Away, away, away down south in Dixie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wish I was in Dixie  
Away, away  
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand  
To live and die in Dixie  
Away, away, away down south in Dixie  
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

Said the night wind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say!  
Pray for peace, people, everywhere  
Listen to what I say!  
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light


Just a minute before you leave, girl  
Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Who've lost all ray of hope  
You know, it ain't even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Come over here from over there, girl  
Sit down here, you can have my chair  
I can't see us going anywhere, girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there  
I wish I'd have been a doctor  
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world  
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
I ain't too good at conversation, girl  
So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.


It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter, anyhow  
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
That light I never knowed  
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talkin' anyway  
So don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
Like you never did before  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
I can't hear you any more  
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can't tell  
But goodbye's too good a word, gal  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But don't think twice, it's all right


"Oh, help me in my weakness,"  
I heard the drifter say,  
As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong."  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
"You fail to understand," he said,  
"Why must you even try?"  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
"Oh, stop that cursed jury,"  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
"The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse."  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.


by Bob Dylan  
  
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.


Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun  
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one  
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind the closed door  
But I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
Come baby, rock me, come baby, locl me into the shadows of your heart  
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start  
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for  
And I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
It's like my whole life never happened  
When I see you, it's if I never had a thought  
I know this dream, it might be crazy  
But it's the only one I got. Okay.  
  
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied  
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide  
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores  
But I will always be emotionally yours.


Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'  
  
Well look over yonder, to that buryin' ground  
Look over yonder, to that buryin' ground  
Sure seems lonesome, Lord when the sun goes down  
  
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die  
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'  
  
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head, up above
my head  
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head  
Can tell Jesus, "Make up my dyin' bed"  
  
Well I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die  
Yes I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die,
fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'


Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.


I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack  
Just a little shanty by the railroad track  
Freight train was it taught me how to cry  
Hummin' of the driver was my lullaby  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my old ma here,  
She was the only daughter of the engineer  
My sweetheart loved a brakeman and it ain't no joke  
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again  
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train  
Every place I want to go  
I never can go, because you know  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.


By Bob Dylan  
  
You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,  
One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:  
"Get your rocks off!  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)"  
  
Well, you know, there late one night up on Blueberry Hill,  
One man turned to the other man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he
said:  
"Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)"  
  
Well, you know, we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek,  
One man said to the other man, he began to speak, he said:  
"Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)"  
  
Well, you know, we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus.  
All kinds-a children in the side road, they was hollerin' at us, sayin':  
"Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! "


If you're travelin' in the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  
If you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin' winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
For that's the way I remember her best  
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
So if you're travelin' the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  


I've just reached a place  
Where the willow don't bend.  
There's not much more to be said  
It's the top of the end.  
I'm going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
I'm closin' the book  
On the pages and the text  
And I don't really care  
What happens next.  
I'm just going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
I been hangin' on threads,  
I been playin' it straight,  
Now, I've just got to cut loose  
Before it gets late.  
So I'm going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart  
And you'll be fine at the end of the line.  
All that's gold isn't meant to shine.  
Don't you and your one true love ever part."  
  
I been walkin' the road,  
I been livin' on the edge,  
Now, I've just got to go  
Before I get to the ledge.  
So I'm going,  
I'm just going,  
I'm gone.


Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,  
I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.  
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.  
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room  
With a golden loom.  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.  
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.


Gonna change my way of thinking,  
Make myself a different set of rules.  
Gonna change my way of thinking,  
Make myself a different set of rules.  
Gonna put my good foot forward,  
And stop being influenced by fools.  
  
So much oppression,  
Can't keep track of it no more.  
So much oppression,  
Can't keep track of it no more.  
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers,  
And old men turning young daughters into whores.  
  
Stripes on your shoulders,  
Stripes on your back and on your hands.  
Stripes on your shoulders,  
Stripes on your back and on your hands.  
Swords piercing your side,  
Blood and water flowing through the land.  
  
Well don't know which one is worse,  
Doing your own thing or just being cool.  
Well don't know which one is worse,  
Doing your own thing or just being cool.  
You remember only about the brass ring,  
You forget all about the golden rule.  
  
You can mislead a man,  
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.  
You can mislead a man,  
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.  
But there's only one authority,  
And that's the authority on high.  
  
I got a God-fearing woman,  
One I can easily afford.  
I got a God-fearing woman,  
One I can easily afford.  
She can do the Georgia crawl,  
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord.  
  
Jesus said, "Be ready,  
For you know not the hour in which I come."  
Jesus said, "Be ready,  
For you know not the hour in which I come."  
He said, "He who is not for Me is against Me,"  
Just so you know where He's coming from.  
  
There's a kingdom called Heaven,  
A place where there is no pain of birth.  
There's a kingdom called Heaven,  
A place where there is no pain of birth.  
Well the Lord created it, mister,  
About the same time He made the earth.


Mary wore three links of chain  
Every link was Jesus name  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.  
  
Mary, Mark, Luke and John  
All these prophets are dead and gone  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.  
  
Well, I've never been to heaven  
But I've been told streets up there  
Are lined with gold  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.


Well, I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.  
While sailing 'round the ocean,  
While sailing 'round the sea  
I'd think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be.  
Don't you remember, molly  
You gave me your right hand?  
You said whenever you'd marry  
I would be the man.  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease.  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin' by  
I could tell her mind was changin'  
By the rovin' of her eye.  
I go down to the river  
Though everyone's asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An' I begin to weep.  
So I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.


Handy dandy, controversy surrounds him  
He been around the world and back again  
Something in the moonlight still hounds him  
Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy  
  
Handy dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it  
He got an all girl orchestra and when he says  
"Strike up the band", they hit it  
Handy dandy, handy dandy  
  
You say, "What are ya made of?"  
He says, "Can you repeat what you said?"  
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"  
He'll say, "Nothin' neither 'live nor dead"  
  
Handy dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money  
He says, "Darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"  
She says, "You got all the time in the world, honey"  
Handy dandy, Handy dandy  
  
He's got that clear crystal fountain  
He's got that soft silky skin  
He's got that fortress on the mountain  
With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in  
  
Handy dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feelin' kind of lazy  
He says, "Ya want a gun? I'll give you one." She says, "Boy, you talking
crazy"  
Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy  
Handy dandy, pour him another brandy  
  
Handy dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full or sorrow  
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table he says,  
"Okay, boys, I'll see you tomorrow"  
Handy dandy, handy dandy, just like sugar and candy  
Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy


Well met, well met, my own true love  
Well met, well met, cried she  
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea  
And it's all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a King's daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there  
It's all for the love of thee  
  
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there  
I'm sure you're the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And I'm sure he's a fine young man  
  
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
I'll take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses, one, two, three  
Saying "take good care of your daddy while I'm gone  
And keep him good company."  
  
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck  
Sayin' she wants company  
  
"Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?  
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?"  
"Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter  
I'm weepin' for my babies three."  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven, my love  
You and I'll never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea


[Chorus]  
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind  
When I try I 'm just wastin' my time  
Lord I've tried and I've tried  
and all night long I've cried  
But I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
Didn't think you would leave me behind  
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind  
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool ev'ry new love you find  
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies  
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.  
  
[Chorus]


Well I'm lookin' the world over  
Looking far off into the east  
And I see my baby comin'  
She's walking with the village beast  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the last part of the day's already gone  
  
We got so much in common  
We strive for the same old ends  
And I just can't wait  
Wait for us to become friends  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well life is for love  
And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby, pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I don't have one single rose  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone


Listen to me, baby,  
There's something you must see.  
I want to be with you, gal,  
If you want to be with me.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm questionin' you.  
To take part in any quiz.  
It's just that I ain't got no watch  
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
I am just a poor boy, baby,  
Lookin' to connect.  
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'  
That I ain't got any respect.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
You know I'd have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience, too,  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm wantin'  
Anything you never gave before.  
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,  
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.


I was in your presence for an hour or so  
Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.


Well, I ride on a mailtrain, babe  
Can't buy a thrill  
Well, I've been up all night  
Leanin' on the window sill  
Well, if I die  
On top of the hill  
And if I don't make it  
You know my baby will.  
  
Don't the moon look good, mama  
Shinin' through the trees?  
Don't the brakeman look good, mama  
Flaggin down the "Double E"?  
Don't the sun look good  
Goin' down over the sea?  
Don't my gal look fine  
When she's comin' after me?  
  
Now the wintertime is coming  
The windows are filled with frost  
I went to tell everybody  
But I could not get across  
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby  
I don't wanna be your boss  
Don't say I never warned you  
When your train gets lost.


All twinklin' lee  
Can't see the right roads when the streets are paved  
The old slave men might grind slow  
But it grinds fine, yeah

Just concentrate, 'cause heaven lives on  
Retired slave men will look with a scorn  
With a transplanted heart (yes, how quick they had to part)

(Stairway To Heaven - Led Zeppelin)  
  
There's a lady who goes  
To the store that won't close  
And she's shopping at 7 Eleven  
  
Down the aisle she sees  
Ding-dongs, beer, and Friskies  
And a Snickers really satisfies her  
  
Ooooh make my Slurpy

You can use it  
Please pay inside before pumping gas

They've been robbed eight times in a row  
And the fluorescent lights glow  
Microwave your burrito  
  
And she's shopping at 7 Eleven

Beers In Heaven  
(Tears In Heaven-Eric Clapton)  
  
Won't it be a shame  
If there's no beers in Heaven?  
Is God the one to blame  
If there's no beers in Heaven?  
  
I must confess  
That I'll be pissed  
If God says He won't allow  
Beers in Heaven  
  
Is the preacher wrong?  
He says there's no beers in Heaven  
How can you party on  
If there's no beers in Heaven?  
  
No Michelob  
No Bud, No Stroh's  
Then I know I just can't go  
There to Heaven  
  
Beer is a friend to Man  
Beer helps you take command  
  
Beer makes things ok  
Beer helps to get you laid  
Get you laid  
  
It's gonna be a shame  
If there's no beers in Heaven  
I'm not the one to blame  
If there's no beers in Heaven  
  
What will I do  
Without cold brew  
Now I know I just can't go  
There to Heaven

(Jamie's Got A Gun-Aerosmith)  
  
Dick Cheyney's got a gun  
Dick Cheyney's got a gun  
The safety's come undone  
Squinting in the Texas sun  
  
What did our leader do?  
Who'd he put a bullet through?  
  
They say when Cheyney goes to Texas  
You'll find him hunting fish and game  
His buddy had it coming 'cause  
When Cheyney's got a gun he's just  
Not that good at taking aim  
  
Cheyney's got a gun  
Dick Cheyney shot someone  
Cindy Sheehan better run  
Gotta watch her liberal buns  
  
Tell him that the war's not through  
He'll probably put a hole in you  
  
He tracked a little bitty birdie  
Hoping to blow out it's brains  
They say the spell that he gets under  
From double-barrelled thunder makes his  
Eyes bug out like he's insane  
  
Run away, run away from the Vice President Yeah Yeah Yeah  
Run away, run away, run from dick Chey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ney  
  
Dick Cheyney's got a gun  
The safety's come undone  
Cindy Sheehan better run  
He's a weapon of mass destruction  
Dick Cheyney shot someone


I Shot The White House  
(I Shot The Sherrif - Eric Clapton)  
  
I shot the White House  
But I did not hit the President  
I shot the White House  
But I did not hit the President  
  
Firing rounds at the compound  
'til a tourist dragged me down  
Bill Clinton was a-watching his tv  
When I strolled right past security  
So I shot, I shot his house  
I swear  
  
I shot the White House  
But I never got inside the fence, oh no no  
I shot the White House  
Guess I must have been a little tense  
  
(Attention! You, with the automatic weapon...  
Uhh... I'm not sure but I don't think you're  
Supposed to have that.)  
(Will agent Moe and agent Larry please proceed  
Immediately to the emergency area)  
(Soi-tainly.)(Ehhh... Grab that gun, numbskull)  
(whoo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)

Watchin' food go by.  
My, my, my.  
I'm a Weight Watcher,

Here comes a cream pie  
Mmmm, mmm, mmm.  
I was just a boy  
When I tried to eat my toy.  
Couldn't reacy my toes  
To put my shoes on.  
But now I'm 28,  
I'm big, fat, and overweight.  
I've got a new pastime to chew on.  
I'm a Weight Watcher,  
I'm a plate watcher.  
Watchin' food go by,

Plate of cheese nachos.

Mmm...I shouldn't, I really shouldn't.  
You make these yourself?  
Well, maybe just two.


(It's In His Kiss, Shoop Shoop Song - Betty Everett)  
  
Is he drug-free?  
I wanna know  
How can I tell  
If he's strung out on dope?  
(Is it bloodshot eyes? )  
Oh no he's got Visine  
(Is he getting' high? )  
His urine won't be clean  
  
If you wanna know  
If he's smokin' dope  
It's in his piss  
(That's where it is)  
It's in his whiz  
(Check out his piss)  
Oh yeah  
  
Piss in  
This plastic cup  
We'll find out what we want to know  
If it's drugs like we think that it is  
It's there in his whiz  
  
(Oh is he smokin' crack)  
Oh my it's hard to say  
But it's certain that twitchin'  
All night and day  
  
If you want to know  
If it's in his nose  
It's in his piss  
(That's where it is)  
Oh yeah  
It's in his whiz  
(And if it is)  
He'll be dismissed  
(No slap on the wrist)  
Oh no  
Because of his piss  
(Pack up your shit)


Ho Ho Ho  
Ho Ho Ho  
Like Guns N Roses with Axel Rose spittin'  
Ozzie's black eyes and the bats that he's bitten  
Big Marshall stacks and a broken E-string  
These are a few of my favorite things  
Ho Ho Ho  
Penthouse apartments and twelve in a hot tub  
Drinking Jack Daniels while getting a backrub  
Little gold chains pinned to brass nipple rings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
We like bar fights  
We like nose rings  
We like eating snails  
We always indulge in our favorite things  
No wonder our skin's so pale  
Girls in black leather with tight little tushes  
Tattoos on big bosoms of prickly rose bushes  
Silver stretch limos that come when I ring  
These are a few of my favorite things  
We like bar fights  
We like nose rings  
We like eating snails  
We always indulge in our favorite things  
No wonder our skin's  
Jingle hell's bells  
Ho Ho Ho


(Baba O'Riley - The Who)  
  
I eat Mrs. Fields  
I snack between meals  
You can see my crack above my Levis  
I don't need to diet  
To prove I'm light  
And I don't peel the skin off of my chicken  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Deep fry  
Don't exercise  
And grow that middle age waistline  
  
It salivates my glands  
To smell a fresh roast ham  
So put out the butter and pass the rolls right over  
A second helping here  
A hefty mug of beer  
Let's get some dinner before the food gets colder  
  
Middle age waistline  
I got a spandex waistband  
Middle age waistline oh yeah  
Not a crumb gets wasted  
  
My belts busted!


Got a flat in Timbuktu  
Waiting for AAA  
And I saw that single headlight through the rain  
Flagged the geezer in the car down,  
He was going the wrong way  
We sped away and left rubber on all four lanes  
He pulled a quick you-turn,  
And hit a pickup from Montana  
While plowin' down a fire hydrant too  
Windshield wipers slappin' time  
As he committed several traffic crimes  
This man's like a one man wreckin' crew  
Speedin's just a little bit of what he put me through  
He went off the road and hit a tree  
Yeah drivin' can't be easy when you're 4 foot 2.  
Drivin's not that difficult to do,  
But it's difficult to do if you're Mr. Magoo  
When we drove right through a coal mine  
And hit a school bus filled with nuns  
We dragged along a string of traffic poles  
Through all kinds of weather  
Through eighteen hit and runs  
I still love that baby  
Kept us on the run  
One day he lost his specs  
Oh lord! He let 'em slip away  
Still lookin' for them glasses  
I hope he finds them.  
Well I'd trade all of my tomorrows for some Dramamine today  
I just hope they know which body bag is mine.  
Speedin's just a little bit of what he put me through  
His drivin', you know it scared the pee right out of me, yeah  
He' s swervin' and he's weaving', and he doesn't have a clue  
You know divan's not that difficult to do  
But it's difficult to do if you're Mr. Magoo  
Oh, lucky for us I know a little used shortcut  
Oh look out, oh look out,  
Oh look out, oh look out,  
Oh look out, watch out now  
Mr. Magoo.


Oh come all ye Grateful  
Deadheads to the concert  
Oh come Grateful Deadheads  
And camp in the street  
Bring rolling papers  
Don't forget your sleeping bags  
Oh come get us some floor seats  
We followed them for four weeks  
Oh come get us some floor seats  
To see the Lord  
  
Come all ye hippies  
Throwbacks to the '60's  
Paint flowers on your van  
And don't wash your feet  
Wear your bell-bottoms  
And your tie-dyed t-shirts  
Oh come let us adore them  
We quit our day jobs for them  
Oh come let us adore them  
Garcia's the Lord  


O. J., O. J.  
O. J., I think you did it.  
But I wanna know for sure.  
You expect people to believe that there are people actually playing golf at
ten o' clock at night?  
Ya wanna know what I think?  
I think you're gonna get passed around like Madonna in an nba locker room.  
O. J. You slime.  
O. J. You gave the devil the ball, you whore.  
O. J. You love it!  
O. J., O. J.  
Well, we've all had enough O. J. Coverage in our lives.  
Me, you, nobody cares any more  
And O. J. You're just sitting there looking bored,  
Spending two hundred thousand dollars an hour on legal fees.  
I'm not impressed.  
I just want you off my T. V.  
Get off my T. V.  
O. J. Nobody uses a cellular phone 20 feet away from their house. Come on!  
O. J., How much did you pay Rosa?  
And now you're going to hell and some loser named Kato has a career.  
You make Ike Turner look like a pussy.  
O. J. Get the hell off my T. V.  
Maybe you'll get an endorsement from Slice.  
O. J. You bastard.  
Get off my T. V


(Horse With No Name - America)  
  
In the aftermath of the jihad  
We were looking for lowlife scum  
There were bombs and guns  
In caves and things  
But Osama must have sprouted some wings  
  
The next thing we saw was a videotape  
And the proof  
It left no doubt  
The heat was hot  
But the trails been cold  
And Bin-Laden has not been fun  
  
He could be ridin' through the desert  
On a horse with Hussein  
It felt good to get out of the caves  
In the desert you can make up a fake name  
And there ain't no bombs  
For to give you no pain  
  
With his beard shaved  
In the desert sun  
Osama begins to turn to red  
In the sun's rays  
You know It ain't no fun  
He's gonna need a another towel for his head  
Some Groucho Marx glasses  
And a nose that sticks out  
Is the perfect disguise  
It's been said  
Avoid the city life  
And don't make a sound  
Or the Marines will fill you with lead  
  
He could be ridin' through the desert  
On a horse with Hussein  
It felt good to get out of the caves  
In the desert you can make up a fake name  
And there ain't no bombs  
For to give you no pain

I bet you're wondering how I knew  
That Prince Charles and Lady Di were through.  
Was waiting in line at the grocery store.  
Took a peek at the dirt about Demi Moore.  
And it took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out the Pope was gay.  
I read it in the tabloids.  
Elvis Presley's doing just fine.  
They put it in the tabloids.  
Got a look at Fergi's boobs, my my.  
Honey, honey, yeah.  
You know JFK didn't really die.  
They got a picture and he looks all right.  
And Ross Perot's hanging out with ET.  
This woman had a kid at a hundred and three.  
And you could have seen it all for yourself  
'Cause it's right there upon the shelf.  
Oh, I read it in the tabloids.  
You know Madonna used to be a boy.  
I saw it in the tabloids  
Right next to a cure for hemorrhoids.  
Honey, honey, yeah.


Dashing through the snow In my rusty Chevrolet  
Down the road I go, Sliding all the way  
I need new piston rings I need some new snow tires  
My car is held together By a piece of chicken wire  
  
Rust and smoke the heater's broke  
The door just blew away  
I light a match to see the dash  
And then I start to pray... hey!  
The frame is bent, the muffler went,  
But the radio's OK  
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet  
  
I went to the store To get some Christmas cheer  
I just passed up my left front tire and it's getting  
Hard to steer  
Skidding down the highway Right past the county cops  
I had to drag my swampers To get the car to stop  
  
Rust and smoke the heater's broke  
  
The door just blew away  
I light a match to see the dash  
And then I start to pray... hey!  
The frame is bent, the muffler went,  
But the radio's OK  
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet  
  
Bouncing through the snow drifts In a big blue cloud of  
Smoke  
People laugh as I drive by I wonder what's the joke  
I got to get to Wal-Mart To pick up the layaway  
Cause Santa Clause is coming soon In his big old rusty  
Sleigh.  
  
Rust and smoke the heater's broke  
The door just blew away  
I light a match to see the dash  
And then I start to pray... hey!  
The frame is bent, the muffler went,  
But the radio's OK  
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet


Station Mir to ground control...  
Station Mir to anyone...  
Send a rescue ship and bring our asses home.  
Station Mir to ground control...  
Systems broke down, engines gone...  
End this mission or we'll all end up marooned...  
This is ground control to Station Mir.

Their engine doesn't cruise, We should send them up some booze


The restroom door said gentlemen  
So I just walked inside  
I took two steps and realized  
I'd been taken for a ride  
I heard high voices turned and found  
The place was occupied  
By two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse  
What could be worse  
Than two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse?  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen  
It must have been a gag  
As soon as I walked in there  
I ran into some old hag  
She sprayed me with a can of mace  
And smacked me with her bag  
I could tell this just wouldn't be my day  
What can I say?  
It was just turning out to be day  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen  
And I would like to find  
The crummy little creep who had the nerve  
To switch the signs  
'Cause I got two black eyes  
And one high heel up my behind  
Now I can't sit with comfort and joy  
Boy oh boy  
No I'll never sit with comfort and joy  


If God had long hair  
And a goatee,  
And if his eyes looked pretty glazed...  
If He looked spaced out  
Would you buy his story?  
Would you believe he had an eye infection?  
And yeah, yeah, God he looks baked  
And yeah, yeah, God He smells good,  
And yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah...  
What if God smoked cannabis?  
Hit the bung like some of us?  
Drove a tie-dyed microbus,  
And he subscribed to Rolling Stone?  
When God made this place,  
In the beginning,  
Did He plant any seeds?  
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve,  
So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake  
Was always offering?  
And yeah, yeah... God rolls great,  
And yeah, yeah, God he smells good,  
And yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah...  
What if God smoked cannabis?  
Do you suppose he had a buzz  
When he made the platypus  
When he created earth, our home?  
Does He like Pearl Jam or the Stones?  
And do you think He rolls His own  
Up there in heaven on the throne?  
And when the saints go marching home,  
Does he just sit and smoke a bone


Well I'm looking for a woman  
About five foot six  
Who ain't into glamour  
She's just into kicks  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Who's gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby

Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love

And my heart's feeling heavy  
Swaying with the beat  
'Cause I'm more than just ready  
She's looking at me  
I can feel it in my bones  
Step right on up  
And I'll be taking you home  
Don't turn away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lot of love  
A whole lot of love  
Well I'm looking for a woman  
Who's looking for a man  
Who's looking for a time  
Like she ain't ever had  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Who's gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby don't run away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love


Words and music by bob seger  
  
Have you heard the news  
It's all over town  
If you ain't heard it boys  
You better sit down  
  
I got the story here  
It's hot off the press  
Brace yourself now  
And take a deep breath  
Grob a hold of something  
Hold on tight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
  
First heard the rumor down on 12th and main  
  
The poor druggist he was going insane  
His stuff is selling out like never before  
He finally had to up and close the store  
  
All the boys were getting ready to fight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
She was bad  
Her momma got mad  
But now her momma said it's all right  
All the boys are getting ready and right  
Betty lou's gettin'out tonight  
  
Betty lou  
Betty lou  
It's all true  
It's really true  
What do you think about that boys


He'll seem to come on with a vengeance,  
You'll think that you've been wasting time.  
You'll think that you've been discussing history  
And he'll have left you far behind.  
Ah, but you must realize he needs you  
To keep himself from going blind,  
And when the black night falls upon you,  
You'll find it easy to be kind... Kind.  
The stars may shimmer in the black sky,  
The wind may rustle in the trees.  
You may be worried he may psych you,  
You might be praying on your knees.  
Ah, but when you realize he needs you  
And when you finally take some time,  
The cool black night will fall upon you,  
You'll find it easy to unwind.  
Hey, the moon may rise on the misty mountain,  
You'll wish you never made the climb.  
But when the black night's finally with you,  
You'll find it easy to be kind,  
You'll find it easy to unwind,  
You'll find it easy to be blind.  


Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard

I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire  
Use a cobra snake for a necktie  
Got a brand new house on the roadside child  
Made out of rattlesnake hide  
Brand new chimney on top  
Made out of human skulls  
Come and take a little walk with me, Arlene  
Tell me, who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
  
Arlene took me by my hand  
Said, "Cool it, Robert, you know you're my man."  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
  
Night was dark, the sky was blue  
Down the alley we was swingin' through  
  
Lord, I heard just what I seen  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?


Southern sun  
Ridin' high  
Winter nights  
Warm and dry  
You've earned your space buddy  
You've done your time  
How come you've got no  
Peace of mind  
  
Lots of work  
Everywhere  
Lots of money honey  
Gettin' your share  
The folks back home say  
They'd love to be in your shoes so  
How come you've got those  
Boomtown blues  
  
You can't miss that freezin' rain  
You'd have to be insane  
To head back north  
And go through all that again  
  
No chill in the air  
No morning dew  
No change of seasons  
The sky always seems so blue  
The earth ain't black and  
The wind ain't cold  
All of a sudden now  
You feel so old  
  
Somethin's wrong  
And it's cuttin' deep  
You're feelin' restless and it's  
Hard to sleep  
Look what you win but  
Look what you lose  
Stuck here in Heaven  
With these Boomtown blues


I was walkin' by the river  
I held my hand out to feel the rain  
  
Just a light rain  
Almost a sun shower  
Makin'all things shine again  
  
And I felt like I belonged  
I felt so strong  
As I walked on  
  
There was rhythm  
And there was order  
There was a balance  
There was a flow  
  
There was patience  
Indulgence  
There was a power  
I could not know  
  
And I felt it all made sense  
The innocence  
The permanence  
  
I took my young son to the river  
I held his hand out to feel the rain


Daughter, daughter, don't do that, don't do that  
But daddy, I said don't do that, alright  
  
Little cat, all alone, somewhere in the midwest  
Where'd you go, who'll you be,  
Maybe you'll turn out to be the best  
Who knows, who knows, come on, yeah yeah  
Cat cat cat cat  
  
Every day, new day, every way, wrong way  
Who'd have seen, who'd have thought  
Nothing but, your tomorrow  
Where and when  
It doesn't matter  
As long as we do it again  
Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat

Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat

That's wonderful  
No I have no hangups

How about you  
You like to do it  
Nothing wrong with that  
What do you mean you hate your mother  
Oh well come on little more a litlle more

Be my cat...  
Cat cat oh oh ahhh


You can change the way you live  
You can make it ?  
You can turn it up or down  
You can change the things you're told  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
Oh oh oh  
You can lie to every face  
You can use a stranglehold  
You can lose or win the chase  
You can sell your very soul  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
Oh oh oh  
You can steal the things you need  
You can keep the people down  
You can take the best there is  
To the shelters underground  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold

There's a highway  
A lonesome stretch of gray  
It runs between us  
And takes me far away  
Out in the distance  
Always within reach  
There's a crossroad  
Where all the victims meet  
I close my eyes  
And see her face  
It's all I want to see  
And deep inside  
It still amazes me  
  
Even now  
She's all that I want  
She's all that I need  
Even now  
She's givin' it all  
She's givin' it free  
Even now  
When everything's right  
When everything's wrong  
Even now  
She's keepin' me straight  
She's keepin' me strong  
She gets to me  
Somehow  
Even now  
  
And through the darkness  
Through all the endless days  
Through all the changes  
The pointless one act plays  
I can still make it  
I can still stand tall  
Cause I've got my girl  
To get me through it all  
Through all the doubt  
And all the fear  
And all that I can't say  
Still somehow  
She'll help me find my way  
  
Even now  
She's still in my heart  
She's still in my soul  
Even now  
She's still on my mind  
Wherever I go  
Even now  
Through all of my days  
And all of my nights  
Even now  
She's keepin' it real  
She's keepin' it right  
  
She gets to me  
Somehow  
Even now  
She's all that I want  
She's all that I need  
Even now  
  
She's givin' it all  
She's givin' it free  
When everything's right  
When everything's wrong  
She's keepin' it real  
She's keepin' it strong  
Even now


I've been down in the Delta workin' these fields  
Breakin my back, I need a better deal  
So long Mississippi, so long Alabam  
I want to face the promise of the Promised Land  
I've got fevered dreams, mighty plans  
I need a black top road, I need a wheel in my hands  
So long Arizona, so long desert sands  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
I'm tired of this river, these nothin' nights  
I'm small towned out, I need city lights  
So long Allegany, so long Olean  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
I'll need a world of changes, I need a  
Brand new space  
I need an Eldorado, that's got to be someplace  
There's a line inside I think I've crossed  
You better watch out now I'm gonna  
Be my own boss  
So long Massachusetts, so long Framingham  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
So long North Dakota you must understand  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  


I take my card and I stand in line  
To make a buck I work overtime  
Dear Sir letters keep coming in the mail  
I work my back till it's racked with pain  
The boss can't even recall my name  
I show up late and I'm docked  
It never fails  
I feel like just another  
Spoke in a great big wheel  
Like a tiny blade of grass  
In a great big field  
To workers I'm just another drone  
To Ma Bell I'm just another phone  
I'm just another statistic on a sheet  
To teachers I'm just another child  
To irs I'm just another file  
I'm just another consensus on the street  
Gonna cruise out of this city  
Head down to the sea  
Gonna shout out at the ocean  
Hey it's me  
And I feel like a number  
Feel like a number  
Feel like a stranger  
A stranger in this land  
I feel like a number  
I'm not a number  
I'm not a number  
Dammit I'm a man  
I said I'm a man


Words and music by bob seger  
  
Here comes old rosie she's looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot nancy she's steppin' right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Here come the men faces hidden from the light  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop  
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
That's when they come and go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in vegas happens in moline  
On the blue blood streets of boston  
Up in berkeley and out in queens  
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight  
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right  
  
And he's looking out for rosie and she's looking mighty fine  
And he's walking the streets for nancy  
And he'll find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the midnight  
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below


Words and music by bob seger  
  
There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight  
There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied  
The fire inside


Day after day I'm more confused  
But I look for the light through the pouring rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
Oh I'm feeling strange, ain't it a shame  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
  
I'm getting the feelin that I'm wasting my time  
You don't understand the things I do  
The World outside looks so unkind  
I'm countin' on you, to carry me through  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
  
And when my mind is free  
No melody can move me  
When I'm feelin blue  
I guess I'm coming through and soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to klnow I believe in your soul  
Let me rhyme in harmony  
You helped me along, you're makin me strong  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll  
And drift away


In your time  
The innocence will fall away  
In your time  
The mission bells will toll  
All along  
The corridors and river beds  
There'll be sign  
In your time  
  
Towering waves  
Will crash across your southern capes  
Massive storms  
Will reach your eastern shores  
Fields of green  
  
Will tumble through your summer days  
By design  
In your time  
  
Feel the wind  
And set yourself the bolder course  
Keep your heart  
As open as a shrine  
You'll sail the perfect line  
  
And after all  
The dead ends and the lessons learned  
After all  
The stars have turned to stone  
There'll be peace  
Across the great unbroken void  
All benign  
In your time  
You'll be fine  
In your time


Innervenus eye, the fool performs the sky  
Innervenus eye, cause every little heartache whines  
Lord, she looked, she looked, she looked so good

Looked so good, looked so good to me yeah  
Cause you see, I'm free  
Well I'm swimmin' in a sea, Ohhh  
  
She makes her story short for double standard listeners  
Deep inside of me, she knows  
The mirror of her heart is sort of like her sister  
And aviating rhyme and role  
  
Innervenus chain  
Pills won't ease the pain  
Innervenus brain  
Cause the universe is sane  
  
Oh but she looked so good, looked so good to me  
She's all alone, she's on her own  
The wind has blown the heart has grown

You've been dressed in a vest, every minute of your day

When Jesse James was a lad  
He killed many a man  
And he roamed over the Scarsdale range  
Robbin' from the rich  
And givin' to the poor  
He was dark and cold and full of rage  
Oh yes he was, sing with me  
Poor Jesse had a wife  
To mourn for his life  
And three children  
They were oh so brave  
But that dirty little coward  
He went and shot Mr. Howard  
Laid poor Jesse in his grave yeah  
  
It was on a Saturday night  
When Jesse was at home  
Talking to old railroad Jed  
Along come Robert Ford  
Like a theif in the night  
And he shot poor Jesse in the back  
  
Poor Jesse had a wife  
To mourn for his life  
Three children  
They were oh so brave  
But that dirty little coward  
He went and shot Mr. Howard  
Laid poor Jesse in his grave yeah  
He lays  
Six feet under the ground


Hey, got my hands in my back pocket  
I'm a jumpin'  
Unscrewing the light from the socket  
And I'd rather stand than sit  
Puttin' all the people in the dark  
Tellin' everyone good night bye bye  
I put the sound  
  
Carryin' the truth in my back pocket  
My hands are holdin' me down  
I've been waiting for people to ask me  
What have you found  
  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I was dead before a gypsy  
She held my head and  
Fought with my boots till my eyes turned red  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
Oh I'd rather stand than sit  
I've been down to the gutter  
Hopin' I've lived on honey and butter  
But with me a life's a game  
I call insane  
I'm not the one to blame  
I'm called insane  
  
I was hung when I was young  
I was named insane  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I broke all the laws before my age  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
Yeah I'd rather stand than sit  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I turn around to see the clown  
But with me a life's a game  
I call insane  
I'm not the one to blame  
I'm called insane  
  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I'd rather stand than sit  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I'd rather stand than sit  
I put the sound


Here we go tape rolling  
Sgt. Pepper take 6  
  
He doesn't know which way to go  
Even though he's made the dough  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
He's lost his mind  
??????????????  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
  
He spent his time with words of rhyme  
He's rang the chime  
We must find  
  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
He's lost his mind  
He had it yesterday  
Lennie Johnson's lost his way  
  
An apple a day keeps the doctor away  
I've heard them say  
Not today


In the heat of the day, down in mobile, alabama  
Workin' on the railroad with a steel drivin' hammer  
Tryin' to get some money, get some brand new shoes  
Tryin to find a lady, chase away my blues  
Hot and wasted lord sweatin' in the sun  
'cause I'm not a foreman 'till my work is all done  
Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low  
I'll be out there waitin' for the whistle to blow  
Sittin' in the teepee smokin' out on the track  
Rollin' them bones (meaning dice) till my foreman get back  
Suddenly I hear the breakman up and shout  
There's a non-stop train comin' two miles out  
Everybody jumpin' and a scrambling around  
Tryin to get the line an get the teepee down  
Railroad owner's 'bout to go insane  
Tryin' to get the workers out the way of the train  
Here come the engineer honk his horn  
He got a non-stop train, we got to let it roll on!  


Stood there boldly  
Sweatin', in the sun  
Felt like a million  
Felt like number one  
The height of summer  
I',d never felt that strong  
Like a rock  
  
I was eighteen  
Didn't have a care  
Working for peanuts  
Not a dime to spare  
But I was lean and  
Solid everywhere  
Like a rock  
  
My hands were steady  
My eyes were clear and bright  
My walk had purpose  
My steps were quick and light  
And I held firmly  
To what I felt was right  
Like a rock  
  
Like a rock, I was strong as I could be  
Like a rock, nothin', ever got to me  
Like a rock, I was something to see  
Like a rock  
  
And I stood arrow straight  
Unencumbered by the weight  
Of all these hustlers and their schemes  
I stood proud, I stood tall  
High above it all  
I still believed in my dreams  
  
Twenty years now  
Where',d they go?  
Twenty years  
I don',t know  
I sit and I wonder sometimes  
Where they',ve gone  
  
And sometimes late at night  
When I',m bathed in the firelight  
The moon comes callin', a ghostly white  
And I recall  
I recall  
  
Like a rock, standin', arrow straight  
Like a rock, chargin', from the gate  
Like a rock, carryin', the weight  
Like a rock  
  
Like a rock, the sun upon my skin  
Like a rock, hard against the wind  
Like a rock, I see myself again  
Like a rock


When your baby up and leaves you  
Up and leaves you flat  
Don't you laugh my friend sometimes it happens just like that  
First you feel the anger then the sorrow will soon take control  
And there'll be hard times for sure  
Long cold lonely nights  
  
It might not sound like much  
But it'll mean a lot you'll see  
Every hour you survive will come to be  
A little victory  
Little victory  
  
As you struggle through each day  
Each strange new day  
Feelin' lost and wounded tryin' hard to find your way  
No one there to talk it out with  
Learnin' how to sleep alone  
Overcomin' each new doubt  
Tryin' hard just to accept it all  
  
Everytime you keep control when you're cut off at the knees  
Everytime you take a punch and still stand at ease  
Little victories  
Little victories  
  
And when night falls and there's no one around  
The cruelest time of all and not one sound  
Listenin' to the wind blow  
Listenin' to the tickin' of the clock  
Tryin' hard to forget  
Tryin' hard to just accept it all  
  
As you step out in the night take a lesson from the trees  
Watch the way they learn to bend with each breeze  
Little victories  
Everytime you make it through  
It's another little victory  
Day by day minute by minute  
Little victories


I was the baby brother,  
I was the quiet other,  
And I remember mother so well.  
I was the little stranger,  
I never was in danger,  
I could 'a had a manger, pray tell.  
Oh, how she could control me,  
When I was bad she'd scold me,  
Sometimes she wouldn't hold me,  
And I'd cry.  
But momma she never told me a lie -  
Momma she never told me a lie.  
I used to stay out evenings,  
Stay out too late some evenings,  
And momma would be there seething,  
Back home.  
Momma, she sat and waited,  
Sat in the hall and waited,  
Now I know why she hated  
That phone.  
And when I'd come in she'd grab me,  
Right by the arm she'd grab me,  
Lord, when she was finished with me,  
I'd cry ... Oh, I'd cry.  
But momma she never told me a lie.  
Momma she never told me a lie.  
Momma she could control me,  
And when I was bad she'd scold me,  
Sometimes she wouldn't hold me,  
And I'd cry.  
Momma she never told me a lie.  
Momma she never promised me the sky.  
Momma she never told me a lie.  


No matter who you are no matter what you do  
There's gonna be someone wants something else from you  
Yeah  
This is an ancient test, it's a shiny lie  
Discover somethin' pure then sit and watch it die  
Yeah  
No matter who you are no matter where you've been  
No matter what you've done you'll have to start again  
No matter who you are  
Between the soaring dreams and the bottom line  
So much is given up so much is left behind  
Yeah  
This is the price you pay, this is the beast you feed  
When you abandon hope and you give in to greed  
No matter who you are no matter who you've been  
You'll have to sort it out and start again  
No matter who you are  
No matter who you are  
Don't take this wrong don't let it bring you down  
It's just the way things work in this great big town  
  


Paint them a picture Jane  
And you can hang it on the wall  
Tell them it's me they see  
Don't tell them why I'm small  
  
If they ask you why I'm crying  
Just tell them someone is dying  
And that he was just a friend  
Don't let em see that you pretend  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Put it in a frame  
One with lots of colors  
Sign it with your name  
Sign your name  
Sign your name  
  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Like the one you painted for me  
Tell them that I'm in love  
But don't tell them they will see  
If they ask you why I'm crying  
Just tell them someone is dying  
And that he was just a friend  
Don't let em see that you pretend  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Put it in a frame  
One with lots of colors  
Sign it with your name  
Sign your name  
Sign your name


Jan would climb up so high on the foul screen  
Down below I would yell to watch out  
When we'd play ? was always the winner  
He was brave never listened to me shout  
Afternoons playin' ball by the old wall  
Hidin' out and of course be the star  
Kept my records in old looseleaf notebooks  
And today I think I still know where they are  
Oh, Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When I was young, in my prime  
On my way  
When the rain never got in my way  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
Some nights, Drifters playin' on the hi-fi  
Talkin' 'bout girls, or preposterous lies  
Laughin hard, watchin' Soupy at eleven  
Skonkin' down, one of Mom's lemon pies  
Ten o'clock, bringin' groceries from the market  
Singin songs, to the darkness of the night  
Even sang the parts the instruments were playing  
Life was freer, dreams were really quite all right  
Oh, Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When the sun seemed to smile on it's way  
When the darkness was easier to play yeah  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
Yesterday, I heard they shut the trains down  
The ones than ran, by the field where I would play  
Said the folks want new and faster transportation  
It's just like me, I'll be obsolete one day  
Oh, Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When I was young, in my prime  
On my way  
When the rain never got in my way  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
  
  


Yeah, gonna tell my tale  
Come on,  
Come on.  
Give a listen,  
Cause I was born lonely  
Down by the riverside.  
Learned to spin fortune wheel  
And throw dice.  
And I was just thirteen  
When I had to leave home.  
Knew I couldn't stick around,  
Had to roam.  
I ain't good lookin',  
But you know I ain't shy.  
Ain't afraid to look a girl  
In the eye.  
So if you need some lovin'  
And you need it right away,  
Just take a little time out  
And maybe I'll stay.  
  
Then I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
Lord I got to gamble,  
Gamblin' man.  
Ahh I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
And I was born a ramblin' gamblin' man.  
  
I hope you got money,  
Sho gonna need some.  
Ain't gonna run on lovin'  
And I got to run.  
I got to keep movin',  
Never gonna slow down.  
You can have your funky world,  
See ya 'round.  
  
I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
Yeah I got to gamble,  
Gamblin' man.  
Ahh I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
I was born a ramblin' gamblin' man.


I still remember how I fell for you  
There wasn't one thing I would not do  
I still recall the love in your eyes  
Blue like the sky on a clear sunrise  
And it was Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
I was yours you were mine  
It was Real At The Time  
  
You were a lioness tall and lean  
You were the best thing I'd ever seen  
I heard a loneliness in your voice  
I charged ahead I had no choice  
Cause it felt Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
Like a mountain you climb  
It felt Real At The Time  
  
And babe you meant so much to me  
I never will forget your face  
I never will forget those nights  
Those nights  
Those nights  
  
Lost in the pettiness and the fights  
Lost in the battle for bragging rights  
We were a couple of kindred souls  
Fighting for childish things like control  
  
But it was Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
Like the scene of a crime  
It was Real At The Time  
It was Real At The Time  
I was yours you were mine  
We got way out of line  
But it was Real At The Time


Words and music by bob seger  
  
I think I've found the real love  
Genuine and true  
I think it's really come my way today babe  
I think it's really you  
  
I remember moments looking in your eyes  
Could have sworn I saw the spark of love babe  
Flickering inside  
  
I've been around this track  
And the only thing I lack  
Is the real love  
  
Every time I see you, every time we touch  
I can feel the way you feel for me babe  
And it means so much  
  
And every time you look at me  
It's just the way it all should be  
In the real love  
  
Oh darlin' darlin' darlin'  
Stay with me stay  
I long to see you in the morning sun  
Everyday everyday  
  
So until that moment  
When I take your hand  
I'm gonna try to do my very best babe  
To prove that I'm your man  
  
I'm gonna do my very best  
I'm not gonna rest  
Until we've got the real love  
  
Real love  
Until we've got the real love


No man ever sounded so lonesome  
No man ever made you feel such pain  
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you sing that way  
The stories you told about prison  
'Bout a young man gone astray  
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you write the songs that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It's a miracle you're standin' here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
You spent most all your life with strangers  
With a ramblin' fever in your veins  
Hag, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you write the songs that way, oh, yeah  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It's a miracle we're standin' here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
Must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  


I saw them standing on a corner  
Bathed in ordinary light  
They turned away and started walkin'  
And faded off into the night  
Some years ago they were in fashion  
Tonight they couldn't get a seat  
They've got themselves a brand new history  
From Revisionism Street  
Written on Revisionism Street  
  
The years of sacrifice and struggle  
The arc of stardom's natural course  
The inevitable decline  
The wolves waiting at the door  
"Let's dig up something really nasty"  
"Let's get some clay around their feet"  
"No ones memory is sacred 'round here  
On Revisionism Street"  
  
"We'll never be in the arena"  
"Hey, we'll never have to compete"  
"We'll never write a classic novel"  
"And we'll never have to be discreet!"  
  
Alfred Hitchcock, Isaac Newton  
Elvis Presley, Captain Bligh  
They're heroic or pathetic  
Depending on which book you buy  
Charles Dickens, Jackie Gleason  
Burn 'em all, turn up the heat  
If there's no truth, use innuendo  
This is Revisionism Street  
  
"Let's find ourselves some old acquaintance"  
"Let's see what they have to say"  
"Some disgruntled ex-employee"  
"Presto! Payday!"  
  
A tree falls in the forest  
A million copies go to print  
Some parasitic little feeder  
Sits back and makes a mint  
Somewhere a baby's softly sleeping  
Lt's innocence complete  
Unaware they're workin' late tonight  
On Revisionism Street


It's the age of reason for the anarchist  
It's a change of venue for the lobbyist  
It's a dream of justice buried in the grist  
  
It's a secret briefing based on need to know  
It's a condescending rationale from command control  
Feel the sense of wonder at the overthrow  
  
It's a rite of passage through a hurricane  
Through a rolling thunder through a screaming rain  
Hear the shriek of Abel hear the cry of Cain  
  
And Abraham will take his son  
Five billion years from now the cruelty will be done  
  
Make a destination  
Of the greater truth  
Make 'em hang their heads and eat their words  
When you find the proof  
This is all you're given  
It's your only move  
  
It's a rite of passage for the everyman  
To a higher ground  
To a brighter light  
To a promised land  
You can feel the power  
Of the master's hand  
  
It's a rite of passage


Simplicity it works for me  
It keeps me runnin' hard, and sharp and true  
I focus on the basic stuff  
And pretty soon I'm comin up on you  
So much clutter clouds our way  
Fundamentals win the day  
I break you down size you up  
I see a path and then I bust a move  
Before you know we'll hit you babe  
I finish and I'm on to somethin' new  
Complex theories have their place  
I like throwdowns in your face  
Its clear, when it's really really near  
And its everything you need  
Rise and be worthy of the prize  
Get exactly what you need  
Simplicity in everything  
In every single thing you say and do  
Don't get lost, in foggy stuff  
Stay on track and let it come to you  
Keep your focus on your goal  
Use that iron hard control  
Use your power and your speed  
Get exactly what you need  


Dressed up to the nines  
Dancin' three-quarter time  
The champagne is on ice  
No one's gonna guess  
In your brand new dress  
Girl, you sure look nice  
  
Have a good time  
Honey, don't look back  
Stone in the middle of the aftermath  
  
Don't wink, don't blink  
Don't let 'em think  
His leavin's got you down  
Stand straight, hang tough  
When they bring it up  
Baby hold your ground  
  
If they pry, don't sigh  
Pass it off with a laugh  
It's all part of living through the aftermath  
  
You can do it honey  
Keep that smile so sunny  
You can show them what they want to see  
Yes, you can  
  
It's a cold, hard scene  
The singles thing  
Losers everywhere  
And it hurts to the bone  
Headin' home alone  
When someone used to be there  
  
So you take a few falls  
And you learn to bounce back  
It's all part of living through the aftermath  
  
Living through the aftermath  
Baby, don't look back  
It's the aftermath


Words and music by bob seger  
  
Think in terms of bridges burned  
Think of seasons that must end  
See the rivers rise and fall  
They will rise and fall again  
Everything must have an end  
Like an ocean to a shore  
Like a river to a stream  
Like a river to a stream  
It's the famous final scene  
And how you tried to make it work  
Did you really think it could  
How you tried to make it last  
Did you really think it would  
Like a guest who stayed too long  
Now it's finally time to leave  
Yes, it's finally time to leave  
Take it calmly and serene  
It's the famous final scene  
It's been coming on so long  
You were just the last to know  
It's been a long time since you've smiled  
Seems like oh so long ago  
Now the stage has all been set  
And the nights are growing cold  
Soon the winter will be here  
And there's no one warm to hold  
Now the lines have all been read  
And you knew them all by heart  
Now you move toward the door  
Here it comes the hardest part  
Try the handle of the road  
Feeling different feeling strange  
This can never be arranged  
As the light fades from the screen  
From the famous final scene


Don't you know it doesn't matter  
Who you are or what you'd really like to be  
Cause it's all without your mind  
And you weren't born blind  
  
And you don't have to see  
Just keep it in your heart  
And if it takes you far  
It's a start man  
It's a start  
Women were sent from heaven above  
And love needs to be loved  
Needs to be loved  
  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved


The silent fall of evening snow  
Another thing you can't control  
Does it chill or warm you soul tonight  
You've become a mystery  
Will I earn your honesty  
I'll never know if we agree  
If you're not here  
And we travel separate roads  
And we carry different loads  
And in the end we stay or go  
The long goodbye continues on  
Through fog and rain and far beyond  
You stay awhile and then you're gone again  
I look into your restless eyes  
You turn away it's no surprise  
I wonder if it's even wise but I'm still here  


By the light of the moon  
To a 50's tune  
He pledged his love to her  
A girl so rare  
A girl so fair  
The girl for him for sure  
He could see himself getting up every mornin'  
For the rest of his life  
Just to look in those eyes so blue  
It was all he ever wanted to do  
She was all he'd ever need to see him through  
  
They were still in their teens  
When he gave her the ring  
They were married late one May  
And they moved into a little house  
On the far end of town  
Out by the big highway  
And all through the days  
And all through the nights  
The cars and trucks rolled on by  
And he slept through it all just fine  
Every night he slept just fine  
  
Sometimes she'd stare at the stars out the window  
Sometimes she'd walk 'neath the moon  
Sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping  
Hoping the dawn would come soon  
  
She'd done well in school  
She'd followed the rules  
And she'd always stood out from the rest  
She'd go off to college  
And work her way through  
Then move to some city out west  
She had it all planned  
She'd have her career  
She'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked  
  
She'd wake up one morning all packed  
And leave here and never look back  
  
Most of her friends thought it soon would be over  
Not many thought it would last  
Most seemed to think they were all wrong for each other  
And soon it would pass - soon it would pass  
  
Now twenty years have gone  
And her kids have moved on  
And she's still on the far end of town  
Her youngest - she's livin' somewhere in L. A.  
And her oldest - he works on a nearby farm  
Her husband comes home  
And they talk over supper  
He's usually the first to turn in  
Another day comes to an end  
Another day just ends  
  
And sometimes in the wee hours when the traffic dies down  
She'll hear the sound of some bird on the wing  
And she'll look out the window and she'll look at his picture  
But not at the ring - not at the ring  
She never looks at the ring


Without a warning you took my heart,  
You took it darling, tore it apart  
You left me sittin in the dark, cryin'  
Said your love for me was dyin'  
I don't believe it, I think you outta turn it up  
Turn on your love light  
turn it on up  
just a little bit  
  
I get a little lonely  
In the middle of the night  
I need your lovin'  
Make it all right  
I need your love girl  
Or else I ain't all right  
I need your lovin'  
Or else I ain't all right  
Bring it to me now  
Bring it to me now  
Bring it home darlin'  
An turn it on up now  
Just a little bit  
A little bit  
Turn it up a bit


On a long and lonesome highway  
East of Omaha  
You can listen to the engine  
Moanin' out his one note song  
You can think about the woman  
Or the girl you knew the night before  
But your thoughts will soon be wandering  
The way they always do  
When you're ridin' sixteen hours  
And there's nothin' much to do  
And you don't feel much like ridin',  
You just wish the trip was through  
  
Here I am  
On the road again  
There I am  
Up on the stage  
Here I go  
Playin' star again  
There I go  
Turn the page  
  
Well you walk into a restaurant,  
Strung out from the road  
And you feel the eyes upon you  
As you're shakin' off the cold  
You pretend it doesn't bother you  
But you just want to explode  
  
Most times you can't hear 'em talk,  
Other times you can  
All the same old cliches,  
"Is that a woman or a man?"  
And you always seem outnumbered,  
You don't dare make a stand  
  
Here I am  
On the road again  
There I am  
Up on the stage  
Here I go  
Playin' star again  
There I go  
Turn the page  
  
Out there in the spotlight  
You're a million miles away  
Every ounce of energy  
You try to give away  
As the sweat pours out your body  
Like the music that you play  
  
Later in the evening  
As you lie awake in bed  
With the echoes from the amplifiers  
Ringin' in your head  
You smoke the day's last cigarette,  
Rememberin' what she said  
  
Here I am  
On the road again  
There I am  
Up on the stage  
Here I go  
Playin' star again  
There I go  
Turn the page  
Here I am  
On the road again  
There I am  
Up on the stage  
Here I go  
Playin' star again  
There I go  
Turn the page  
There I go  
There I go


I wanna be a lawyer  
Doctor or professor  
A member of the umc  
I want an air conditioner  
Cottage on the river  
And all the money I can see  
I wanna drive a Lincoln  
Spend my evenings drinking  
The very best burgandy  
I want a yacht for sailing  
Private eye for tailing  
My wife if She's a bit too free  
I've been told ever since a boy  
That's what one aught to be  
A part of the umc  
I want a pool to swim in  
Fancy suits to dress in  
Some stock in gm and ge  
An office in the city  
Secretary pretty  
Who'll take dictation on my knee  
I want a paid vacation  
Don't want to have to ration  
A thing with anyone but me  
And if there's war or famine  
Promise I'll examine  
The details if they're on tv  
I'll pretend to be liberal but I'll still support the gop,  
As part of the umc  
I wanna be a lawyer  
Doctor or professor  
A member of the umc


It seems like only yesterday  
I didn't have a clue  
I stood alone not knowing where to turn  
Now suddenly I look around  
And everything looks new  
I don't know why but I think I'm starting to learn  
  
They call it understanding  
Understanding  
A willingness to grow  
I'm finally understanding  
Understanding  
There's so much I could know  
  
Until the day you came along  
I used to just get lost  
I only heard the things I wanted to hear  
It always seemed like no cared  
Then you took the time  
And now I look and everything seems clear  
  
You've got me understanding  
Understanding  
You've really helped me see  
I'm finally understanding  
Understanding  
It's meant so much to me  
You've got me understanding  
Understanding  
  
You've given me some pride  
I'm finally understanding  
You're really on my side  
Really on my side  
Got me understanding  
Understanding  
  
Understanding  
You've got me understanding  
Understanding  
Understanding  
You've got me understanding  
  
For the first time  
You've got me understanding  
You've got me understanding  
  
Understanding...


Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
There aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure  
Cupid was a blind man  
He must have missed his mark  
Shot an arrow in the air and hit me in the heart  
I went to see Saint Valentine  
Said Whats come over me?  
Daddy must have missed the chapter about the birds and bees  
You can be the King of diamonds  
You can cash in all your gold  
You could hire Johnnie Cochran  
Its too late to save your soul  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
Now someone call my lawyer  
I'm going to see my shrink  
I found myself in the jewelry store buying a diamond ring  
I went to see my doctor  
Said Wont you help me please?  
He said Son I'm sorry, its a terminal disease  
Can't get no love insurance  
Cupid draws his bow  
I aint waving boys, I'm drowning  
Its a damn good way to go  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
You can be the King of Diamonds  
You can cash in all your gold  
You can hire Johnnie Cochran  
Its too late to save your soul  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
No aspirin  
No ambulance  
Or Voodoo you can think up  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
There aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love


Feel me like I feel you  
Won't you let me come inside  
Heal me like I heal you  
Let your mind, body, soul, come alive  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey Hey I'm Alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new day  
And I feel fine  
  
Here to say I'm alive  
Want me like I want you  
That's my heart you hold in your hands  
Touch me like I touch you  
Make me feel like superman  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey hey I'm alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new  
And I feel fine  
  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Like the wind run with me  
Take my hand come with me  
Those bastards ain't bringing us down  
For all the dreams that died  
And all of the tears they cried  
If there's one thing I've learned  
Life is now  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey hey I'm alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Her to stay I'm alive (Didn't think I'd make it)  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new day  
And I feel Fine  
Here to say I'm alive (It's here you got to take it)


Looking at the pages of my life  
Faded memories of me and you  
Mistakes you know I've made a few  
I took some shots and fell from time to time  
Baby, you were there to pull me through  
We've been around the block a time or two  
I'm gonna lay it on the line  
Ask me how we've come this far  
The answer's written in my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time  
When I look at what my life's been comin' to  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
I've lived, I've loved, I've lost, I've paid some dues, baby  
We've been to hell and back again  
Through it all you're always my best friend  
For all the words I didn't say and all the things I didn't do  
Tonight I'm gonna find a way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time  
When I look at what my life's been comin' to  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
You can take this world away  
You're everything I am  
Just read the lines upon my face  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
[Guitar Solo]  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time  
When I look at what my life's been comin' to  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
All about lovin' you


Working hard eight days a week  
Most days we've got no time to speak  
Feels like I'm chasing after my own life  
Girl can't you see you're my only vice  
  
Take the phone off the hook  
Turn the lights down low  
We'll play some old Sam Cooke  
Baby, let yourself go  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't care what kinda clothes you wear  
It doesn't matter how you do your hair  
I don't need no champagne on ice  
Girl, can't you see that you're my only vice  
  
Turn the whole world off  
Keep your high heels on  
Take it nice and slow  
And make it last 'til dawn  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't wanna eat, I don't wanna sleep  
Don't wanna sit around and watch TV  
When you're next to me it's where I wanna be  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I, I wanna do  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to, but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna do  
All I wanna do now, all I wanna do is you  
Baby is you


Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch  
Just half-past noon, trying to figure out just what he's doing  
Why he had to grow up so soon  
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?  
There's got to be some way out of here  
He says, "Man, this life is cruel"  
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life  
She changed her name, her face  
Because the grass looked greener on the other side  
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night  
Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything  
My next door neighbor Donnie  
Died in his room just the other day  
His brother come home  
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein  
Cops come down with a body bag  
They said Donnie was a casualty  
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out  
He couldn't handle reality  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr. I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything  


First time I saw you girl,  
I knew that it wouldn't be long  
I tried holding back my feelings  
But you came on so strong  
No one told me about her  
But I know they all knew  
That I know all about the girls  
That do the things you do  
  
Cause you're all talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
  
You're playing those games with me baby,  
But one of us has got to win  
Someday all the boys are gonna find out  
That you won't even play it with them  
You're running out of numbers baby  
You won't say no, you just say maybe  
One of these days you're gonna get  
What's coming to you  
  
Cause you're all talk, no action  
All talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
You better stop this fooling around  
You're all talk no action  
You turn it up to cool me down, cool me down, cool me down  
  
Sticks and stones will break my bones  
But their names could never hurt me  
Cause I ain't afraid of you running away  
If you love me tonight then desert me  
  
Cause you're all talk, and no action  
You're all talk, but no action  
You're all talk, but no action  
You're all talk  
You're all talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
All talk, no action  
All talk, no action


This Romeo is bleeding, but you can't see his blood  
It's nothing but some feelings  
That this old dog kicked up  
It's been raining since you left me  
Now I'm drowning in the flood  
You see I've always been a fighter  
But without you I give up  
  
Now I can't sing a love song  
Like the way it's meant to be  
Well,I guess I'm not that good anymore  
But baby, that's just me  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
  
Now we're picture's that you left behind  
Are just memories of a different life  
Some that made us laugh  
Some that made us cry  
One that made you have to say goodbye  
  
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair  
Touch your lips, to hold you near,  
When you say your prayers, try to understand  
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man  
  
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near  
When he says the words  
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him  
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you  
'Til the end of time  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
If you told me to cry for you, I could  
If you told me to die for you, I would  
Take a look at my face  
There's no price I won't pay  
To say these words to you  
  
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice  
But baby, if you give me just one more try  
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,  
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
Always


The clock strikes ten  
Out on the streets again  
I been looking for something to please me since I don't know when  
Out on the dark side of town  
Another rumbles gone down  
And life on the high side isn't what this boys about  
  
She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me  
I stand accused  
That I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run  
  
To a heart of chrome  
And a soul of steel  
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal  
And when I give her the gun  
You know she feels so right  
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight.  
  
She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me.  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run  
  
And when the morning comes and I go to sleep  
When I close my eyes she's waiting for me  
I know that tonight she'll satisfy me.  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run


America the beautiful  
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies  
For amber waves of grain  
For purple mountain's majesties  
Above the fruited plain  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
Oh, beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea


I used to see you on every tv  
Your smiling face looked back at me.  
I used to see you on every tv  
Your smiling face looked back at me.  
  
Then they caught you with the girl next door,  
People's money piled on the floor,  
Accusations that you try to deny,  
Revelations and rumours begin to fly.  
  
Now you think about reaching out  
Try to get some help from above.  
Now you think about reaching out  
Try to get some help from above.  
  
Reporters crowd around your house.  
Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds,  
Speculating what they may find out,  
It don't matter now, you're all washed up.  
  
You wake up in the middle of the night.  
Your sheets are wet and your face is white,  
You tried to make a good thing last,  
How could something so good, go bad, so fast?  
  
American dream, American dream,  
American dream, American dream.  
  
Don't know when things went wrong,  
Might have been when you were young and strong. (X 2)  
  
Reporters crowd around your house.

Love lives in New York City  
He got a place off of the park  
Heard he was standing in the ruins  
And in his hands a broken heart  
He called an army of his angels  
I heard they had to hide their wings  
It was them who brought you water  
If you listen closely I know you can hear  
The choir singing  
  
Chorus  
Hey, hallelujah, baby  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
I saw him down south of Canal Street  
Right there in a mother's eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn baby's cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round  
  
Chorus  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
It's different than it was before  
Now we need it even more  
Fire's falling from the sky  
Innocence just said goodbye  
It may never be the same  
Maybe it was time to change  
A time to grieve  
A time to cry  
A time to live  
A time to fly


I'm in this world  
I've got no fun  
Still standing strong  
In army of one  
So sign me up  
I'm a soldier  
  
I've got a voice  
It's all on me  
A beating heart inside of me  
I'm an army of one  
I'm a soldier  
  
These eyes don't know disguise  
They're fighting for their all lives  
They're all trying to get back home tonight  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never give up  
Never let up, Ever  
Never give in  
You're an army of one  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never forget  
Where you're from  
Never give up  
You're an army of one  
  
I can't hurt but I still feel  
I know that life's a battlefield  
When a time get tough  
I'm a soldier  
  
When it's time to the fight  
It's just my side right on my side  
I'm an army of one  
I'm a soldier  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never give up  
Never let up, Ever  
Never give in  
You're an army of one  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never forget  
Where you're from  
Never give up  
You're an army of one  
  
No apologize  
Defend for being alive  
We're all trying  
To get it right tonight  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never give up  
Never let up, Ever  
Never give in  
You're an army of one  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never forget  
Where you're from  
Never give up  
You're an army of one

(sambora, morolda)  
  
Growing up today  
Theres many mountains you must climb  
Youre not the only one  
Cause everybodys on that line  
Hey mister know it all  
What do you recommend  
You think you know the answers  
But the questions never end  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Born outta passion  
To a world gone cold  
Ya wear it on your shoulders  
Its a heavy, heavy load I know  
Love and its emotions  
Come knocking at your door  
Young hearts will be broken  
And times the only cure  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Temptation makes us fall from grace  
But the angels were sinners  
And the sinners saints  
Forgive yourself cause were all the same  
Everybody rides on the karma train  
  
Young hearts  
Better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
Look in your mirror  
Itll tell you the truth  
Don't waste your time away  
Don't waste your life away, no, no  
Live today  
Theres no time to lose  
Cause when tomorrow comes  
Its all just yesterdays news  
  
All just yesterday news


I went to see the preacher  
To teach me how to pray  
He looked at me and smiled  
Then the preacher turned away  
He said if you want to tell him something  
You ain't gotta fold your hands  
Say it with your heart  
Your soul and believe it  
And I'd say amen  
  
Bang a drum for the sinners  
Bang a drum for the sins  
Bang a drum for the losers  
And those who win  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for yourself son  
And a drum for me  
  
I called upon my brother just the  
Other day, he said: John I'm gonna  
Die if I don't start to live again  
I work each day and night like clockwork  
Just trying to make ends meet  
I could kick this bad world's ass  
If I could just get on my feet  
  
I'd bang a drum for the dying  
Bang a drum for the truth  
Bang a drum for the innocence  
Lost in our youth  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for you brother  
And a drum for me  
  
I don't know where all the rivers run  
I don't know how far, I don't know how come  
But I'm gonna die believin'  
Each step that I take  
Ain't worth the ground that  
I walk on  
If we don't walk it our  
Own way  
  
No I don't claim to be a wise man  
A poet or a saint  
I'm just another man who's searching  
For a better way  
But my heart beats loud as thunder  
For the things that I believe  
Sometimes I wanna run for cover  
Sometimes I want to scream  
  
Bang a drum for tomorrow  
Bang a drum for the past  
Bang a drum for the heroes  
That won't come back  
Bang a drum for the promise  
Bang a drum for the lies  
Bang a drum for the lovers  
And the tears they've cried  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
But as long as my heart keeps on bangin'  
I got a reason to believe


Sitting here wasted and wounded  
At this old piano  
Trying hard to capture  
The moment this morning I don't know  
'Cause a bottle of vodka  
Is still lodged in my head  
And some blond gave me nightmares  
I think she is still in my bed  
As I dream about movies  
They won't make of me when I'm dead  
  
With an ironclad fist I wake up and  
French kiss the morning  
While some marching band keeps  
Its own beat in my head  
While we're talking  
About all of the things that I long to believe  
About love and the truth and  
What you mean to me  
And the truth is baby you're all that I need  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
Well I'm so far away  
That each step that I take is on my way home  
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night  
Just to see through this payphone  
Still I run out of time  
Or it's hard to get through  
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you  
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,  
Baby blind love is true  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry  
The barkeeper's wig's crooked  
And she's giving me the eye  
I might have said yeah  
But I laughed so hard I think I died  
  
When you close your eyes  
Know I'll be thinking about you  
While my mistress she calls me  
To stand in her spotlight again  
Tonight I won't be alone  
But you know that don't  
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove  
For it's you that I'd die to defend  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses


I just want all those modern romances  
Always being in love  
When any girl smiled at me I went wild at the touch of her clothes  
Then bang it's off before I know it  
Poor broken hearted me  
  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
  
Jackie's all alone in her room with the TV on  
And she's crying, crying  
Wondering about how her and Joey been getting along  
All this lying, lying  
Tell her this, tell her that  
Where's these lies gonna end  
Things would be much better if her and Joey just stayed friends  
  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
  
What's in it for you?  
He's trying to shoot you down  
Long hot summer nights  
Go out now and find that girl and hold her tight  
Like she's the only girl in the world  
  
You better think twice  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love


Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Since you've been gone now, honey  
Life ain't nothing but sad luck days  
I begged on my knees now, sugar  
You acted like you never knew my name  
  
My friends saw you at the station  
I guess you must have missed your train  
  
Tell me is it 'cause you love me, Billy  
Or is it just because you love the pain?  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
How come you're sad when I get happy?  
Why do you laugh when I want to cry?  
Tell me why when I say I need you  
You turn around and you say goodbye?  
  
Why do you think that a heart's so fragile?  
Can you tell me why love's so blind?  
Just like a magnet you pull me under  
I can't resist you, we're two of a kind  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
Billy, Billy  
Can we be lovers and friends?  
Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend  
There really have to be a happy end  
[Incomprehensible]  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
I never said you had to walk on water  
Or that I could ever stop the rain  
Sometimes we break up just to make up, baby  
And we don't care who's to blame  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
Billy, Billy  
Can we be lovers and friends?  
Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend  
There really have to be a happy end  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
Billy, Billy  
I love you just the same


We met some time ago when we were almost young  
It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from  
I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose  
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes  
  
I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind  
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes  
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat  
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell  
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
No one even cried we were one of a kind  
  
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine


Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you  
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you  
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver  
They paid you some money to sell them my blood  
  
But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
I wonder what would have happened  
If you were the killer  
And I was the hero  
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded  
Your life for my own life  
Would I have paid  
Your debts in your place  
  
But this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
Blood money  
That's what I call it  
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange  
Blood money  
Bought and then sold you  
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave


I'd give you my ring, I'd fill you with promises  
I'd give you anything you want  
If you told me that we could be more than friends  
Run with me baby, on a magic carpet ride  
Well live for tomorrow, everything I'll be alright  
Cause it don't matter what they say  
  
She's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite.  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright  
Come on, lets go  
  
When they say she's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door honey, it'll be alright now  
  
She's Bobby's girl, come on baby, come with me tonight  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright now


Rainy night and we worked all day  
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay  
We got something they can't take away  
Our love, our lives  
  
Close the door, leave the cold outside  
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side  
We got something that'll never die  
Our dreams, our pride  
  
My heart beats like a drum (all night)  
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)  
And I'll never let go cause  
There's something I know deep inside  
  
You were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we don't know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
Light a candle, blow the world away  
Table for two on a TV tray  
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK  
Our time, our way  
  
So hold me close better hang on tight  
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride  
We're two kids hitching down the road of life  
Our world, our fight  
  
If we stand side by side (all night)  
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)  
And I'll know that you'll be live  
In my heart till the day that I die  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we don't know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
My heart beats like a drum (all night)  
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)  
And I'll never let go cause  
There's something I know deep inside  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we don't know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
You were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man


This time girl i've had enough  
You're too hot to handle with kid gloves  
It's too late i hear a knock on the door  
The game's over baby i can't take it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
Breakout, breakout  
Take these chains from me  
You held my heart for ransom  
Baby, set it free  
Breakout, breakout  
Your lies can't hide what i see  
I'm better off on my own  
  
Promises made me in the heat of the night (whoa-oh-oh)  
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (whoa-oh)  
Your lips they burn your body calls my name (whoa-oh)  
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (whoa-oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say we'll meet around midnight  
You're gonna make me feel oh so right  
I'm saying oh no not tonight  
You gotta let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say we'll meet around midnight  
You're gonna make me feel oh so right  
I'm saying oh no not tonight  
You gotta let me go


Dressed up for a big date  
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now  
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face  
She was one of a kind  
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella  
And roller skates in bed  
  
Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown  
When he comes around 'cause they don't let him drive now  
Mixed up as a milkshake  
But make no mistake  
They're shooting for the stars  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
Share a toothpick, trading lipstick  
Watching traffic for days at the diner  
Holding hands, making big plans  
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner  
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
They're drunk on love as you can get  
Getting high on lust and cigarettes  
Living life with no regrets  
At least they're gonna try to fly  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
We're Sid and Nancy  
Fred and Ginger  
Clyde and Bonnie  
Liz and Richard  
Kurt and Courtney  
Bacall and Bogie  
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe  
Here's captain crash and the beauty queen from mars


(sambora)  
  
Woke up in a cold sweat  
In the middle of the night  
Seems like a lifetime  
When youre wondering whos wrong or right  
One confession would resurrect the truth  
Revenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
You never find a reason why love falls from grace  
Some kind of voodoo, like a spirit you can't embrace  
Theres a voice in the mirror, and a ghost in my heart  
That relives the passion before we were torn apart  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire


Now that you're gone, I can see what  
Was going on and how you lied  
When you'd said you'd never love again  
  
Friends telephone and they say  
You weren't out alone last night  
Can't you see that this broken heart  
Is killing me  
  
Another night is falling  
And now my heart is calling you back to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come back cause I need your love  
Come back got to have your love  
Come back bring your loving back to me  
Come back cause it's been so long  
Come back, and my love's still strong  
Come back bring your loving back to me  
  
You play with words play with love  
It's just your silly way  
I'm a fool cause I need you by my side again  
  
Now it's too late you walk by  
With another man  
And I stand alone  
Cause I know that you're not coming home  
  
Another night is falling  
And now my heart is calling you back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another night is falling  
And now my heart is calling you back to me  
  
[Chorus]


Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely  
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue  
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new.  
  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin', what in the world did I do?  
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you.  
  
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you


I light a candle  
In the garden of love  
To blind the angels  
Looking down from above  
I want, I need  
The fruit of your vine  
It tastes so bitter sweet  
'Cause I know it's not mine  
I want to go inside  
Hit the lights and I'll come crawling to your window tonight  
Come on and send the sign  
I'll be your dirty little secret  
And you'll be mine  
You got me knock, knock knocking at your door  
And I'll be coming back for more  
We made a promise and we keep it  
Our dirty little secret  
We act like strangers  
When you're holding his hand  
'Cause there's a danger  
That we both understand  
We run like thiefs  
Through the temple of sin  
Till we fall on our knees then you go back to him  
I want to feel alive  
Hit the lights and I'll come crawling to your window tonight  
Come on and send the sign  
I'll be your dirty little secret  
And you'll be mine  
You got me knock, knock knocking at your door  
And I'll be coming back for more  
We made a promise and we keep it  
Our dirty little secret  
Hit the lights and I'll come crawling to your window tonight  
Come on and send the sign  
I'll be your dirty little secret  
And you'll be mine  
You got me knock, knock knocking at your door  
And I'll be coming back for more  
We made a promise and we keep it  
Our dirty little secret  
Our dirty little secret  
Our dirty little secret  
Our dirty little secret  
Our dirty little secret  


Are. Sambora  
  
Theres a danger of getting so close to you  
There comes a time  
When the walls fade away  
And when love turns to bitter blue  
Sometimes it feels like its so hard to stay  
Last night we went to bed angry  
We didint mean what we said  
Seems we never get past forgiveness  
We try to hide, we never learn  
To swallow our pride.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Baby life has no guarantee  
Never knowing where loves gonna lead  
Even through youre a part of me  
We have to deal with our pain separately  
Sometimes we both feel like victims  
With no easy way out not, no, no  
Somehow we stand by each other  
When were desperate, and drowning in  
The shadows of doubt.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
The times we share the tenderness  
Are the times that keep us alive  
You get in my face, you rough me up  
But baby you know  
can't hurt me nough, to give you up  
And make me let go  
Make me let got oh no, no.  
When youre on the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hare  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Downside of love  
Loves just a long, long road baby  
Yes theres a down side of love  
Stand by my side baby  
When youre on the downside of love  
No, no, no  
Downside of love  
cause its a long, long road baby  
Downside of love.


Welcome to the party  
Come on in and disappear  
You're feeling like a stranger  
But all your friends are here  
Little lines and cracks  
Around your eyes and mouth  
Something's trying to get in  
Something's trying to get out  
  
It's OK, to be a little broken  
Everybody's broken, in this life  
It's OK, to feel a little broken  
Everybody's broken, you're alright  
It's just life  
  
Step into the deep end  
Make yourself at home  
When you wonder why your breathing  
Know you're not alone  
It's so hard to believe  
It's easier to doubt  
You're trying to hold in  
But you're dying to scream out  
  
It's OK to be a little broken  
Everybody's broken  
In this life  
It's OK to feel a little broken  
Everybody's broken, you're alright  
It's alright, it's just life  
  
Take a look around  
Tell me what you see  
Is who you think you are  
Who you want to be  
  
It's OK, to be a little broken  
Everybody's broken, in this life  
It's OK, to feel a little broken  
Everybody's broken, you're alright  
Just keep on going  
Eyes wide open  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Yeah


I read the paper just the other day  
About a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave  
They say he went in his sleep with a smile on his face  
Bet he was dreaming 'bout better days  
  
When the crash of the drums hit like waves on a beach  
That cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams  
We were searching for a savior like anybody else  
Trying to save ourselves from ourselves  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
  
Our parents all held jobs but we had other plans  
We acted like our heroes they just didn't understand  
And we were never afraid to fall  
It was us and those four walls  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
Just us, those guitars and a Saturday night  
  
'Cause with a strap on your back, you have wings on your feet  
You felt like a king when you walked down the street  
We heard those old records and knew we belonged  
When the drums hit the groove, we'd all sing along  
  
Just a garage band  
Oh, we were livin' in Garageland  
Just a garage band, oh, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
It was us, those guitars and a Saturday night


Why, you want to tell me how to live my life?  
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?  
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand.  
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man.  
My daddy lived the lie, it's just the price that he paid.  
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away.  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
  
Take a look around you, look nothing's what it seems.  
We're living in a broken home of hopes and dreams,  
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand.  
Everybody, pray enough to take a stand,  
I knocked on every door, on every dead end street,  
Looking for forgiveness,  
What's left to believe?  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
  
When the world keeps trying, to drag me down,  
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground.  
Well I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day


So now you want to change sides  
You say the lesson's been learned  
I can tell by your voice, baby just got burned  
I can see in your eyes, and read your lips so well  
You're a master at disguise but it ain't hard to tell  
  
Anyone that's been through it before knows that look  
I can read through your mind like a story book  
And there's no happy endings to this life  
  
Cause I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of those heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night  
Calling over and over again  
  
The voices came and took advantage, now you don't want to play  
When the word got around he gave your secrets away  
Now it's too late to cry you know the damage is done  
Dry your tears say goodbye and know he wasn't the one  
  
All your life you been in and out of love  
Now you've folded your cards when push came to shove  
You're just another number, just a victim of love's lies  
  
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of your heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night  
Calling over and over again  
  
Over and over again  
You hear the cries through the night  
Over and over...  
  
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of your heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night, calling over and over  
Those heartbreak eyes  
I can feel the pain you hide deep inside  
Deep inside of those heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night, calling over and over  
Those heartbreak eyes  
I can feel the hurt inside your heartbreak eyes  
I can hear the cries at night, over and over again


Heaven help the child who never had a home,  
Heaven help the girl who walks the street alone  
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall,  
Heaven help us all.  
Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day,  
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away,  
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl,  
Heaven help us all.  
Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all.  
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call  
Oh, yeah!  
Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one,  
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun.  
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall,  
Lord, Heaven help us all.  
Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all.  
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call.  
Now I lay me down before I go to sleep.  
In a troubled world, I pray the Lord to keep, keep hatred from the mighty,  
And the mighty from the small,  
Heaven help us all.  
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!  
Heaven help us all.


When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
And you stop and you turn  
And you go for a ride  
Till you get to the bottom  
Then you see me again  
Do you, don't you want me to love you?  
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you  
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Do you, don't you want me to make you?  
Coming down fast I don't want me to break you  
Tell me , tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
Where you stop and you turn  
And you go for a ride  
Till you get to the bottom  
And I see you again  
Do you, don't you want me to love you?  
Coming down fast I'm right above you  
Tell me , tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  


Now I've always been a dreamer  
I've had these fantasies run through my mind  
The vivid memories of days we spent together  
They seem so long ago  
Why'd you have to leave me, why'd you let me go  
  
We're used to chasing rainbows, but they're not hard to find  
My baby used to love me, fame left it all behind  
Now I've become a prisoner, locked up behind four walls  
You say I've got life easy, but I've got no life at all  
So now I've made the grade, they know who I am  
I've made it to the top a lonely man  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Smile for the cameras is all they ever say  
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away  
They chase me through the streets, calling out my name  
I'm coming home to you, this life is driving me insane  
Climbing up those stairs, knocking on the door  
She don't recognize me or want me anymore  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood Dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot Lights  
The spot lights can't bring back you're love to me  
Chasing those Hollywood...


When I was just a boy  
The devil took my hand  
Took me from my home  
He made me a man  
So, don't talk to me about sympathy now  
Cause you can't dance if you  
Take a chance on your rosary  
  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On the homebound train  
  
It's been a millions years  
That I been gone  
I been everywhere, now I'm heading home  
Been a lot of girls, but  
There's a woman I know  
Said don't take no plane  
Better take a train  
Cause I like it real slow  
  
All the way back home  
On the homebound train  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On the homebound train  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm heading home  
To be with my baby  
Where I belong  
Coming down the tracks now  
See, I done my time  
I'm going back now  
To that home of mine  
Well, here I come baby  
  
Here I come baby  
Here I come baby  
  
All the way back home  
On that homebound train  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On that homebound train


Hello, is there anybody out there?  
I'm alone hanging by a thread  
Everywhere around the world  
Everybody's waiting for someday  
Calling out around the world  
Maybe someday might be tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hook me up  
I'm reaching out for you, come on  
Hook me up  
I know you can do it, come on, take me on  
  
Are you there?  
Tell me what you're feeling.  
Your fears and all your wildest dreams  
Everyone around the world  
Is feeling just the same way that we are  
Reaching out around the world  
Will someone somewhere throw me a line?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Save me, save me  
Save me, save me  
Hello, is there anybody out there?  
  
Calling out around the world  
Maybe someday might be tonite  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hook me up  
I'm hanging on the line, come on  
Hook me up  
Make me come alive, come on, take me on  
  
Save me, save me,  
Save me, save me


How you spend your minutes are what matters  
All tomorrows come from yesterdays  
When you're feeling broken, bruised and sometimes shattered  
Blow out the candles on the cake  
Like everything's a big mistake  
  
It seems you always wait for life to happen  
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break  
If all we've got is us then life's worth living  
And if you're in, you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
We're just who we are, there's no pretending  
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin  
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending  
And if you're in you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
I ain't got no halo hanging over my head  
I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you  
I am, I am  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
I am  
I am


All I know is what I've been sold  
You can read my life like a fortune told  
I've seen the dream, there's no land of Oz  
But I got my brain and I got a heart  
And courage built I won't let go  
What we need right now is, soul  
  
I can't do this, you can't do that  
They feed us lines but I won't act  
And all good things will come to pass  
But the truth is all you have to have  
And would you lie for it?  
(Do you) cry for it?  
(Would you) die for it?  
Would you  
  
I believe, I believe  
With every breath that I breathe  
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream  
I believe, I believe  
  
You know what you came here for  
You'll pay the cost,  
like it's your cross to bear  
Are we the ones that put it there  
Would you scheme for it  
scream for it, bleed for it  
Would you  
  
I believe, I believe  
Believe we're still worth  
The fight you'll see  
There's no hope for this world tonight  
I believe, I believe  
  
Don't look up on your movie screens  
In record stores or magazines  
Close your eyes and you will see  
That you are all you really need  
  
I believe, I believe  
With every breath that I breathe  
You and me can turn a  
whisper to a scream  
I believe, I believe


The silicon chip inside her head,  
Got switched to overload  
Nobodys gonna go to school today,  
Shes gonna make them stay at home,  
And daddy doesn't understand it,  
He always said she was good as gold,  
And he can see (no reasons)  
Cause there are (no reasons)  
What reason do you need to be shown  
  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
I want to shoot the whole day down  
  
The telex machine is kept so clean  
And it types to a waiting world,  
Her mother feels so shocked  
Fathers world is rocked  
And their thoughts turn to  
Their own little girl  
Well sweet 16 aint she peachy keen,  
And it aint so neat to admit defeat,  
There could be (no reasons)  
Because there are (no reasons)  
What reasons do you need, oh,  
  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
I'm gonna shoot the whole day down, down, down  
Ill shoot it all down  
  
And all the playings stopped in the playground now  
She wants to play with her toys a while  
And school is out, oh and soon we will learn that  
The lesson today is how to die  
And then the bullhorn crackles,  
And the captain tackles  
With the problems and the hows and whys  
And he can see (no reasons)  
Cause there are (no reasons)  
What reasons do you need to die, die, oh  
  
And the silicon chip inside her head  
Gets switched to overload, oh  
And nobodys gonna go to school today  
Shes gonna make them stay at home  
And daddy doesn't understand it  
He always said she was good as gold  
And he could see (no reasons)  
Cause there are (no reasons)  
What reason do you need to be shown  
  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like, I don't like  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like, I don't like  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
(tell me why) I don't like mondays  
I want to shoot the whole day down


Frank Sinatra died today  
I came home and found my mama crying  
The tv had so much to say  
Somehow I was thinking about dying  
I'm seventeen and thinking about dying  
I don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
I see my daddy in his chair  
He sits there night and day  
The tv still looks good as new  
Daddy's old and gray  
And it's scaring me to death  
I don't want to go that way  
I don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because your heart's still beating  
It don't mean that you're alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
You can see the glass half-empty  
You can see the glass half-full  
But all I see are shattered dreams  
Around this neighborhood  
My brother's girlfriend's pregnant  
And today she's moving in  
My friends all play the lottery  
And swear one day they'll win  
I'm seventeen, I'm thinking about dying  
I'm seventeen, no way I'm dying  
Don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because you're breathing  
It don't mean that you're alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Don't want to live forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Don't want to live forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever


It feels like I'm walkin' on air  
When we walk down our street  
When the neighbors stop to watch us walk by  
You can hear 'em talking (let them talk)  
  
Sometimes I think that you're the only reason  
The sun still shines (when it shines)  
And when this wicked world starts bringing me down  
I tell myself that I'm one lucky guy  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the girl (with all the cards)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)  
  
She says that someday she's gonna marry me  
When that day comes that we walk down the aisle  
She'll make me feel like a prince, a lord or a king  
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids  
And she won't brush her hair (I swear)  
She don't like wearing shoes in December  
But I don't care (I don't care)  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the girl (with all the cards)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)  
  
If I was a holy man I'd get down on my knees  
So the angels that watch over her would give a break to me  
Holy Mother of saint bubble gum and sister band-aid knees  
Won't you please pray for the ones like me  
  
But the truth is someday  
Somebody is gonna take her (you see)  
But the queen of hearts will always be  
A five-year-old princess to me (to me)  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the girl (with all the cards)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)  
  
I got the girl (she's gonna leave her mark)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (she's gonna break your heart)  
  
I got the girl


What time is it baby? Is it that time again?  
When snow will be falling, friends will be calling  
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing Silent Night  
I love when they sing, the feeling it brings  
It's warm as a fire is bright  
  
Soon there'll be toys for the good girls and boys  
And reindeer are heading our way  
Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above  
There's one thing I wanted to say  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
  
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Claus  
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was  
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say  
That is the greatest gift, one you can give everyday  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
  
Now the mistle-toe and the house a-glow  
All the world seems at ease tonight  
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass  
Is why can't every day be so bright?  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
Honest I do, yes I do now  
Very merry Christmas


I played the part of a broken heart upon a shelf  
I played that part so lonely and so well  
Thought that love belonged to someone else not me and you  
Yeah, I know that you've been shattered , you been bruised  
We both know what it feels like when you lose  
But I'd bet my life on the roll of the dice for you  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you  
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If that's what it takes  
  
I bet you counted all the tears I bet you've cried  
I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside  
'Cause it hurt you way too bad to say good-bye  
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test  
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget  
But I'm driving blind, I'll lay it all on the line for you  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
Tonite 's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you  
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If that's what it takes  
  
So, when you feel like jumping,  
Just when your heart starts pumping  
When you're standing out on that ledge-staring over the edge  
I'll be there to talk you down, I'll be there before you hit the ground  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you  
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If that's what it takes  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If we take the time to do it right, I know we'll pull through  
If it took all my life, I'd prove it to you  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do


I guess this time you're really leaving,  
I heard your suitcase say goodbye.  
And as my broken heart lies bleeding,  
they say true love is suicide.  
  
You say you've cried a thousand rivers,  
and now you're swimming for the shore.  
You left me drowning in my tears,  
and you won't save me anymore.  
Now I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl.  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for you  
  
I know you know we've had some good times,  
Now they have their own hiding place.  
I can promise you tomorrow,  
But I can't buy back yesterday.  
  
And baby you know my hands are dirty,  
But I wanted to be your Valentine,  
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby  
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for you  
  
And I wasn't there when you were happy,  
I wasn't there when you were down.  
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby  
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for...  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for you


Seven days of saturday  
Is all that I need  
Got no use for Sunday  
Cause I don't rest in peace  
Don't need no Mondays  
Or the rest of the week  
I spend a lot of time in bed  
But baby I don't like to sleep no  
  
I won't lie to you  
I'm never gonna cry to you  
I'll probably drive you wild 8 days a week  
  
Until I'm 6 feet under  
Baby I don't need a bed  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Till they roll me over  
And lay my bones to rest  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
So you're looking for some action  
I got got everything you need  
Better keep your motor running  
Cause I was built for speed  
This ain't no slumber party  
Got no time for catching z's  
If they say that that ain't healthy  
Well then living's a disease  
  
We're never going to die baby  
Come on let me drive you crazy  
We'll make every night another New Year's Eve  
  
Till I'm six feet under  
I won't need a bed  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Till they roll me over  
And lay my bones to rest  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead  
Gonna live while I'm alive,  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Seven days of Saturday  
Is all that I need  
  
Got no use for Sunday  
Cause I don't rest in peace  
I was born to live  
You know I wasn't born to die  
But if they party down in heaven  
I'll be sure to be on time  
  
Until I'm six feet under  
I don't need a bed  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Till they roll me over  
And lay my bones to rest  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
I feel like I'm exploding  
Going out of my head  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
Till I'm six feet under  
And they lay my bones to rest  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead  
Gonna live while I'm alive, sleep when I'm dead


Look at this world  
It's filled with worn out places  
Forgotten faces  
And nothing changes  
  
Whatever happened  
To that new day rising  
We're just surviving  
And living is dying  
  
Are you tired  
Of being let down  
Another day  
Another shakedown  
  
I'm with you  
We hope is gone  
All you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
when it seems no use  
I'm with you  
  
I'm with you  
If I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
  
I walk in shadows  
That seem all familiar  
I've read the papers  
A life forsaken  
  
A mumble some from  
I'm one more for sale sign  
Down on Main street  
You just walk by  
  
How many times you gotta  
Break down  
Before somebody's  
Gonna shout out  
I'm with you  
  
We hope is gone  
All you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
When it seems no use  
I'm with you  
  
If I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
  
When hope is gone  
And all you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
When it seems no use  
It seems no use, It seems no use  
  
When I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)


Imagine there's no heaven,  
It's easy if you try,  
No hell below us,  
Above us only sky,  
Imagine all the people  
Living for today...  
  
Imagine there's no countries,  
It isn't hard to do,  
Nothing to kill or die for,  
No religion too,  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer,  
But I'm not the only one,  
I hope some day you'll join us,  
And the world will live as one.  
  
Imagine no possesions,  
I wonder if you can,  
No need for greed or hunger,  
A brotherhood of man,  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing all the world...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer,  
But I'm not the only one,  
I hope some day you'll join us,  
And the world will live as one.


You want commitment, and take a look into these eyes.  
They burn with fire, Yeah, until the end of time.  
And I would do anything, I'd beg, I'd steal,  
I'd die to have you in theses arms tonight.  
  
Baby I want you like the roses want the rain,  
You know I need you like a poet needs the pain.  
And I would give anything. My blood, my love, my life.  
If you were in these arms tonight.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,  
I'd get down on my knees for you.  
And make everything alright,  
If you were in these arms.  
I'd love you, I'd please you,  
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.  
And love you till the end of time,  
if you were in these arms tonight.  
Oh, yeah.  
  
We stare at the sun, and we made a promise.  
A promise this world would never blind us.  
And these were our words.  
Our words were our songs.  
Our songs are our prayers.  
These prayers keep me strong, and I still believe.  
If you were in these arms.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,  
I'd get down on my knees for you.  
And make everything alright,  
If you were in these arms.  
I'd love you, I'd please you,  
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.  
And love you till the end of time,  
if you were in these arms tonight.  
  
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room.  
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume.  
Everything here reminds me of you.  
There's nothing I wouldn't do.  
And these were our words, they keep me strong, baby.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,  
I'd get down on my knees for you.  
And make everything alright,  
If you were in these arms.  
I'd love you, I'd please you,  
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.  
And love you till the end of time,  
if you were in these arms tonight.  
  
If you were in these arms  
Baby, like the roses need the rain.  
Like the seasons need to change.  
Like the seasons need to change.


J. Bon jovi  
  
You know your favorite old pair of shoes  
The ones with the hole in the toe you wont lose  
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used  
But still you love to play when your feeling blue  
  
That faded rose that's all dried out  
Those bukowski poems we couldn't live without  
Your high school pic when you had wild hair  
That stormy day on the beach that got us here  
  
Oh, you better believe theres just one thing you need  
Can't you see...  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
  
Just like a shadow 10 feet tall  
Standing right behind you should you fall  
Ill be the one to hold you up to walk  
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl  
  
Abd if your waves should ever break at sea  
Ill be there waiting, I'm that sandy beach  
I'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleas  
Ill be by your side, you can count on me  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks  
Every time you go away  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
And if someday some new memory comes along  
Looking shiny new, feeling really strong  
You can tell him that Ill tell him  
He can just move on  
I'm a fighter - I've been fighting for you all night long  
Its just me baby

Hey, man, it's been a while  
Do you remember me?  
When I hit the streets I was 17  
A little wild, a little green  
  
I've been up and down and in between  
After all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
I like the bed I'm sleeping in  
It's just like me, it's broken in  
It's not old -- just older  
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans  
This skin I'm in it's alright with me  
It's not old -- just older  
  
It's good to see your face  
You ain't no worse for wear  
Breathing that California air  
When we took on the world  
When we were young and brave  
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave  
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not old enough to sing the blues  
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes  
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff  
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose  
  
Well, I look in the mirror  
I don't hate what I see  
There's a few more lines staring back at me  
The nights have grown a little colder  
Hey man, I gotta run  
Now you take care  
  
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair  
It's been all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder  
  
[Chorus]


Hey mister can you help me  
I'm a loner on the run  
I'm just looking for tomorrow  
And I ain't gonna hurt no one  
  
I jumped headfirst into a bottle  
I was looking for a friend  
Came up just short of nothing  
I didn't find the truth I only found an end  
  
So tell me who's gonna save me  
Or my father or my son  
When the only justice a man can see  
Is the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
I been broke and I've been hungry  
I think they're both my middle name  
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough  
Still guess I can't complain  
  
'Cause what you get in life you take it  
You've gotta hold on and make it last  
They say good things come to those who wait  
But it's life that goes so fast  
  
And when there's just one rule you live by  
Each day you kiss the rising sun  
When you live and die by the life we breathe  
In the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night  
And a gun somewhere is burning  
With my name  
  
Winners are losers  
And losers will have to face  
All those yesterdays  
And all of the dreams they blew away  
  
So mister can you help me  
Or are you my gun  
Have the ghosts of justice  
Brought you here to me to taste  
The barrel of a loaded gun  
  
There's justice in the barrel  
Of a loaded gun


I get up every morning, drink coffee alone  
My house it's too quiet, I'm the only one home  
I let the newspapers pile up at the door  
I can't be bothered, I don't read 'em no more  
The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring  
I can't make much sense out of anything  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
  
I get in the car like I do every day  
Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way?  
It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there  
I'd do anything to be anywhere but here  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel  
  
Now the parking attendant knows my first name  
These long green hallways all look the same  
There's four elevators, one goes to that floor  
I brace myself when I get to the door  
I close my eyes and take a deep breath  
Then sit down beside your hospital bed  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel  
  
He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls  
People laughing like children through these hospital halls  
There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood  
There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel


October leaves are falling, so am I  
A harvest moon is calling me and I know why  
The traffic's like a symphony in blue  
  
In the autumn air I smell your sweet perfume  
I miss you sitting cross legged in this empty room  
Yesterdays are eating me alive  
  
I'm your angel, baby  
I've got broken wings  
I can't walk, I can't run, I can't drop  
Until you're next to me, so the only thing  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
You try to reach me but I've sailed away  
You tried to read me but my words got in the way  
The music's over but the dance has just begun  
  
I wish that I could just get back to Baltimore  
You know I'd scratch, I'd claw, I'd scream  
Till I'm raw, just to fall down at your door  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that don't come back  
'Cause the train has left the station with my pain  
Let them forget my name, oh  
  
I'm on a last chance train  
  
Sitting here I smoke my nineteenth cigarette  
Now all that's left are ashes, butts and my regrets  
It's your taste that I just can't forget  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that don't come back  
We'll be laughing at them, crying in the rain  
It's you and I again, oh  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
I'm on a last chance train  
It's gonna bring me home to you  
Oh, the last chance train  
Coming through, my babe  
This time I'm coming through  
Coming through


J. Bon jovi  
  
I was walking on a wire  
Looking down, there was no net  
Now, I'm standing at your door  
Me and my last cigarette  
  
Yeah weve been through this before  
Too late to cover up my tracks  
Damn the fool who begs for more  
Ill take my past and paint it black  
  
Now the circus has left town  
This clown has got to get his feet back on the ground  
  
I'm learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
Now I'm learning how to fall  
Yeah, I got the hang of it  
  
I was standing in the light  
There were faces all around  
I put my gloves up for a fight  
One sucker punch and I was down  
  
I'm learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
I'm learning how to fall  
Yeah, I got the hang of it  
  
I was flying through the clouds  
Pucker up, its time to kiss the ground  
  
I'm learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
I'm learning how to fall  
Now I got the hang of it


I'll be there to hold you by the hand  
When you need someone to walk you home  
You know that I'll be there to understand  
When you call me on the phone  
I'll be there to watch you when you sleep  
When you close your eyes at night  
And I'll be there to keep your secrets kept  
  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
I swear each word is true  
There's only one thing I wouldn't do  
I'll be there when you need a real friend  
I'll be there to listen to your secrets  
I'll be there and give you all I've got  
I'll be there when you paint your masterpiece  
And I'll be right beside your every move  
  
I'll give you my eyes so you can see  
And I'll help you to find the things you've lost  
When you're busting at the seams  
I swear each word is true  
There's only one thing I wouldn't do  
I ain't gonna love you  
I ain't gonna love you  
  
Nobody wants you like I want you  
Nobody needs you like I need you  
You know I would beg and plead, get down on my knees  
I'd do most anything, it's true  
But I ain't gonna love you  
I ain't gonna love you  
'Cause I love you  
I'll be there to love the things you love  
I'll be the one who knows your middle name  
  
Be the only one that you can trust  
I'll give you the blood that's in my veins  
I swear these words are true  
There's only one thing I wouldn't do  
I ain't gonna love you  
  
'Cause nobody wants you like I want you  
Nobody needs you like I need you  
You know I would beg and please, get down on my knees  
Do most anything for you  
But I ain't gonna love you  
I ain't gonna love  
'Cause I love you  
Because I love you


Levon wears his war wound like a crown  
He calls his child Jesus'cause he likes the name  
And he sends him in the finest school in town.  
  
Levon, Levon likes his money  
He makes a lot they say  
Spends his days counting  
In a garage by the motorway.  
  
He was born a pauper  
To a pawn on a Christmas Day  
When the New York Times  
Say God is dead and war's begun.  
Alvin Tostig Has a son today.  
  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man.  
And he shall be Levon.  
In tradition with the family plan  
And he shall be Levon.  
And he shall be a good man.  
He shall be Levon.  
  
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town.  
His family business thrives.  
Jesus blows up balloons all day,  
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly.  
And, Jesus he wants to go to Venus.  
Leave Levon far behind.  
Take a balloon and go sailing,  
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.  
  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man.  
He shall be Levon....


Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down  
He's gonna pay the rent  
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get  
It feels like there is a stranger standing in these shoes  
But, I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you  
  
I know I promised baby  
I would be the one to make our dreams come true  
I ain't too proud of all the struggles  
And the hard times we've been through  
When this cold world comes between us  
Please tell me you'll be brave  
  
'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away  
If you don't love me, lie to me  
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be  
Right now if you don't love me baby, lie to me  
  
Pour another cup of coffee, babe I got something to say to you  
I ain't got the winning ticket  
Not the one that's gonna pull us through  
No one said it'd be easy, let your old man take you home  
But know if you walk out on me  
That darling, I'd be gone  
  
If you don't love me, lie to me  
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be  
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me  
Baby, I can take it  
  
It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride  
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes  
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone  
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on  
  
If you don't love me, lie to me  
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be  
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me, lie to me  
Baby I can take it


Needed a car, looked around for a week  
For two dollars down I signed my name on the lease  
There was a knock on my door, old man wants his keys  
All he said was something about bankruptcy  
  
Oh no, here we go  
There ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days like these  
  
Minding my own business in a restaurant  
Trying to get some dinner but then guess what?  
Some chick got there I slept with, threw her drink in my face  
And then her ugly brother kicked my ass all over the place  
  
Oh no, here we go  
Ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days like these  
Too short baby  
  
I met her last night at quarter to three  
I couldn't believe that she came home with me  
Woke up this morning scratching now I know when to leave  
They say you lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas  
  
You know that life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days  
Life's too short for days like these  
Seems like lately baby it's all trick or treat  
I'd get up and dance if I could get on my feet  
  
Life's too short for days  
Life's too short for days  
Life's too short for days like these  
  
Life's too short for days like these  
Wish I could close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Cause life's too short  
You know that life's too short for days like these  
They say life's too short


You been robbed  
You been used  
You been crucified and  
You been abused  
You been sacrificed and  
Now you're confused  
Ain't it the truth  
  
You got a hole in your head  
And a cold empty spot  
In your big brass bed  
When you're mad at the world and  
You feel like you're losing control  
All you need to get by is  
A little bit o soul  
  
When you've lost in the flood  
And you feel like you been  
Kicked through the mud  
You know they still  
Haven't found the drug  
To pick us up  
  
Feeling down, misunderstood  
You know these times  
They ain't looking so good  
When you're mad at the world and  
You feel like you're losing control  
What we all need to get by is  
A little o soul  
  
Whoa oh  
Little bit of soul  
What we all need  
To survive  
Is just  
A little bit o soul  
  
Everyone's complaining  
Nothing but frustration  
The king has pissed in  
Your pot of gold  
It ain't entertaining spending  
So much time in the hole  
Send down  
A little bit o soul  
  
When you're mad at the world  
And you feel like  
You're losing control  
What we all need  
To get by is just  
A little bit o soul  
  
Whoa oh little bit o soul  
  
Whoa oh little bit o soul  
  
Whoa oh little bit o soul


J. bon jovi  
  
I got my call light on  
Gimme one more fare tonight  
Just get me over the bridge  
I can see those shiny bay lights  
You know Im never alone  
But Im feeling lonely tonight  
Damn, I got my last cigarette  
But I aint got not light  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
In my rear view mirror  
I see someone elses hairline  
I hear that fire in your eyes  
Is on the rock and doing hard time  
  
And the grapes of wrath, theyre on the vine  
Theres wine in this dirt  
Here love aint love  
Its just another four letter word  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
Now that cold gray fogs  
Just a rolling down the highway  
Hes come to carry me home  
Its put a little smile on my face


I don't need no license  
To sign on no line  
And I don't need no preacher  
To tell me you're mine  
I don't need no diamonds  
I don't need no new bride  
I just need you, baby  
To look me in the eye  
I know they have a hard time  
And your Daddy don't approve  
But I don't need you Daddy  
Telling us what we should do  
  
Now there's a million questions  
I could ask about our lives  
But I only need one answer  
To get me thought the night  
So, I say  
  
Baby, can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me  
Or just this world we live in  
I say we're living on love  
They say we're living in sin  
  
Is it right for both our parents  
Who fight it out most nights  
Then pray for God's forgiveness  
When they both turn out the lights  
Or wear that ring of diamonds  
When you heart is made of stone  
You can talk but still say nothing  
You stay together but alone  
  
Or is it right to hold you  
And kiss your lips goodnight  
They say the promise is forever  
If you sign it on the dotted line  
  
Oh baby, can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me or  
Just this world we live in  
I say we're living on love  
They say we're living in sin  
  
Baby, can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me or  
Just this world we live in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
I don't know where to begin  
I don't know where we fit in  
Living in sin


Tell Franie I'm sorry she didn't get to know her dad  
I'll bet he's sorry he didn't get to know you too  
Tell her there'll be people singing things that make her sad  
How her daddy felt alone how he was hurtin' bad  
I guess that won't be too far from the truth  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy is one thing it's not.  
  
I was jaded, suffocated, it got too hard to breath  
But I never got as high as I needed to be  
You know life becomes worthless when they steal your dreams  
I just couldn't live with what was left for me  
And I couldn't run far enough from the truth, what's the use  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy's one thing it's not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there can help you stop before you hit the ground  
It's lonely at the top ooh yeah  
  
Tell Franie, I'm sorry I better kiss her when she cries  
I'm sorry I left her, never said good bye  
Didn't mean to leave you all alone but then the music died  
Through the song remains the same, I couldn't live that lie  
You know that ain't too far from the truth  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy's one thing it's not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there to help you stop before you hit the ground  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
It's lonely


I need someone, I need somebody to be a friend,  
I'm not alone, but still I'm lonely in the end  
She was runnin' away on the 9 o'clock train, so very far from home,  
With a head full of schemes, a handful of dreams  
I was on my own  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
What can I do, what can I say, to get her back,  
Alone I wait before my train comes runnin' down the tracks  
Heaven knows that I'd wait if God were to say that you would come  
I guess you can say it's the price that you pay for holdin' on  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
If you want me, if you need me, I'll be there,  
If you want me, please believe me, I'll be waiting  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night


Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
In my rearview mirror  
My life is getting clearer  
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears  
These trinkets once were treasure  
Life changes like the weather  
You grow up, grow old, or you hit the road 'round here  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Watching white lines passing by  
With my plastic dashboard Jesus  
Waiting there to greet us  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, hey  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
Yeah, I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
Out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Don't know where I'm going  
But I know where I've been  
I'm afraid of going back again  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Years and miles are flying by  
And waiting there to greet us  
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh patron saint of lonely souls  
Tell this boy which way to go  
Guide the car, you've got the keys  
Farewell to mediocrity  
Kicking off the cruise control  
And turning up the radio  
Got just enough religion  
And a half a tank of gas  
Come on  
Let's go  
  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
When I'm out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
On this lost highway


She counts the days away and waits for valentines  
She says every girl in the past is just a waste of time  
You know, whoa  
She don't believe in miracles and make-believe  
If you were blind you still could see  
That she believes in me, Oh  
Feels like I found a pocket full of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lucky baby  
So lucky baby  
Lucky to be with you today  
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"  
So lucky baby  
Whenever I see your smiling face  
Lucky to be the one to be lucky  
  
Now all of heaven's angels have to wear their wings  
She likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings  
You know, oh  
She brings sunshine to a cloudy day  
When we walk on by people stop and say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lucky baby  
So lucky baby  
Lucky to be with you today  
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"  
I'm lucky baby  
  
I got lucky when you found me  
It only took one kiss to see  
What did I do to get to be so lucky baby?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lucky baby  
Whenever I see your smiling face  
Lucky to be the one to be lucky


Seems like years since I've been home  
Living this dream on the endless roads  
Faces in the crowd, they stare at me  
Yours is the only one I wanted to see  
My heart cries out for sympathy  
But I need to hold you next to me  
And it won't be long, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
These hotel rooms they're all the same  
Only the number on the door will be changed  
Lord I gotta do me one more show  
Then it's into the bus and off we go  
Should have talked to you  
Well I don't have to try  
When I find the music in your eyes  
And I'm telling myself that we'll take that ride, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
I should've talked to you  
Well I don't got to try  
Where I can find the music in your eyes  
We're all blind, two lovers, into the night  
Maybe tomorrow  
Maybe tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Maybe tomorrow  
  


Should I? Could I?  
Have said the wrong things right a thousand times  
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind  
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine  
  
You cried, I died  
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south  
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb  
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one  
I'm wasting time when I think about it  
  
[Chorus:]  
I should have drove all night,  
I would have run all the lights  
I was misunderstood  
I stumbled like my words,  
Did the best I could  
Damn, misunderstood  
  
Could I? Should I?  
Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night  
Staying out too late with all my friends  
You found me passed out in the yard again  
  
You cried, I tried  
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie  
It's not so bad when you think about it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Intentions good  
  
It's you and I, just think about it  
  
I should have drove all night  
I would have run all the lights  
I was misunderstood  
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could  
I 'm hanging outside your door  
I've been here before  
Misunderstood  
  
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could  
Damn, misunderstood  
Intentions good.


Thunder cracks, the sky is crying  
On her back she's pushing trying  
He holds her hand and kneels beside her bed  
Break the silence baby screaming  
In slow motion she ain't dreaming she closed her eyes looked  
Up to God and says  
  
Chorus  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets  
Living's hard and dying's easy  
My mistakes they won't defeat me  
I like to burn the candle at both ends  
I've broke some hearts been broken hearted  
I've run away from fires I've started  
I didn't break but tried my best to bend  
  
Chorus  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets  
  
No regrets-for things I've done  
No regrets-for wars I've won  
No regrets-for fires I've started  
No regrets-for faith departed  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I die a little more  
Should I lie a little more  
Should I get high a little more  
  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets

With a magic circle as that company

Bye bye bluebird, bye bye bluebird  
You were lots of fun to know  
But I have to let you go  
Bye bye bluebird, bye bye bluebird  
You're the flyin' saucer kind  
In and out and hard to find  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird

When you came I flipped my lid  
I never thought I'd lose you kid  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Though we were a perfect pair  
It was a flight-by-night affair  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
Oh I should have clipped your wings  
I'm not gonna do these things  
Bye bye bluebird  
Bye bye bluebird  
If you ever should be near

Bye bye bluebird

No hard feelings anyway  
It's nice to know we had our way

In the hills above Freno  
By a shiny mountain stream  
A young man laid where he fell  
In the ruins of his dreams  
He looked into the sky  
Happy to see that the dawn was slowly breaking  
And the women knelt beside him  
Consuela Biaz  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Consuela Biaz she knelt there and gently  
She bathed his wounds  
And he kissed her trembling fingers  
Consuela Biaz  
  
In the town San Domingo  
As we laughed and danced all night  
To the thrub of flamingo guitars  
Seemed a long long way from tomorrow's fight  
He came from over the sea  
Full of the passion of when  
You were born to be free  
From the Valley of Ronda  
Consuela Biaz  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Consuela Biaz from the Valley of Ronda  
To the hills above Freno  
Just to die against her shoulder  
Consuela Biaz  
  
I'm sorry if I have failed you


D - I - Z - Z - why  
D - I - Z - Z - why  
You make me dizzy  
D - I - Z - Z - why  
D - I - Z - Z - why  
You make me dizzy  
D - I - Z - Z - why  
I'm so dizzy  
My head is spinning  
Like a whirlpool  
It never ends  
And it's you girl  
Making it spin  
You're making me dizzy  
First time that I saw you girl  
I knew that I just had to make you mine  
But it's so hard to talk to you  
'cause boys are hangin' round you  
All the time  
I want you so much behind  
But you keep playing hard to get  
I'm going round in circles all the time  
Dizzy, I'm so dizzy  
My head is spinning  
Like a whirlpool  
It never ends  
And it's you girl  
Making it spin  
You're making me dizzy  
D - I - Z - Z - why  
You make me dizzy  
D - I - Z - Z - why  
I finally got to talk to you  
And told you just exactly how I felt  
And I held you so close to me  
And kissed you when my heart began to melt  
How you took coltrol of me  
'cause I'm so dizzy I can't see  
I need to call a doctor for some help  
Dizzy  
D - I - Z - Z - why

Brown girl in the ring  
Tra la la la la  
This is the story of El Lute  
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal  
Because he was poor  
But he refused to accept his fate  
And today his honor has been restored  
  
He was only nineteen  
When was sentenced to die  
For something that somebody else did  
And blamed on El Lute  
Then they changed it to life  
And so he could escape  
From then only chased him  
And searched for him day and night  
All over Spain  
But the search was in vain  
For El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
The man they called El Lute  
And he wanted a home  
Just like you and like me  
In a country where all would be free  
Though he taught himself  
To read and to write  
It didn't help El Lute  
He was one who had dared to escape overnight  
They had to find  
El Lute  
  
Soon the fame of his tale  
Spread like wild fire  
All over the land  
Were the prize on his head  
People still gave him bread  
And they gave him a hand  
For they knew he was right  
And his fight was their fight  
  
No one gave you a chance  
In the Spain of those days  
On was every place  
They had put up the face of El Lute  
And he robbed where he could  
Just like once Robin Hood  
They finally caught him  
And that seemed the end  
But they caught him in vain  
Cause a change came for Spain  
And El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
And then freedom really came to his land  
And also to El Lute  
Now he walks in the line  
Of a sunny new day  
The man they call El Lute


I was born and raised in the ghetto  
Talk with me and you'll know  
I wasn't satisfied, with living on the side  
I started looking around, for a possibility  
  
Listen to my story, of what became of me  
I met a businessman  
Who said he had some friends back east  
So why don't you come along  
Well we can help you at least  
We'll make you into a big star  
By playing your guitar  
But the joke was on me  
They left me flat to see  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know I'll make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my music's playing all night  
Going back west (going back west)  
I think I'll do alright  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know I'll make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my music's playing all night  
Going back west (going back west)  
I think I'll do alright  
  
Struggling for recognition, identity and respect  
I got a lot of promises  
They told me not to fret  
So we will stand by you  
If the going gets rough  
But when I started thinking  
They didn't even bluff  
  
'Bout a year has come and gone  
And left me standing here  
Thinking how it could have been  
For still I ain't nowhere  
They surely took me for a ride  
Trampled on my pride  
But I hold my head up high  
Got no more tears to cry  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know I'll make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my music's playing all night  
Going back west (going back west)  
I think I'll do alright  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know I'll make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my music's playing all night  
Going back west (going back west)  
I think I'll do alright  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know I'll make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my music's playing all night


Whirlwind you must know he can't leave  
Ever since he was young he had known what a man should know  
With no hatred inside  
  
Whirlwind take the wife and the child  
Find the trail that leads south  
To the lands they have given you  
The new home for your tribe  
  
Brother of blood  
I have heard that the soldiers are two moons away  
They come with many guns  
And death is waiting for a brave man  
Such as you  
  
Goodbye my friend you must be on your way  
Down through the canyons we wait and we pray  
Goodbye my friend you can linger no more  
Gun smoke is rising so run to that war  
Beyond the hills the far horizon  
In the purple evening sky  
You'll find the valley of walhalla  
There when you die


Walk around in circles  
Without peace and little sleep  
Can't cool down and unwind  
What I'm feeling is a feeling  
That's just you down deep  
Got a man on my mind  
Haven't seen him for so long  
He's always on the go  
Not the sticking round kind  
I don't care whatever happens  
One thing I do know  
Got a man on my mind  
Sometimes I stand there  
Just starrin' into space  
And I talk about how I feel (yeah yeah)  
Being there  
Yet I clearly see his face  
And I hold him and he's quite real  
Never thought that I could care  
For anyone that much  
Oh how wrong can you be  
I'm so hungry for his kisses  
For his tender touch  
He's the whole world for me  
Oooh  
Walk around in circles  
Without peace and without sleep  
Can't cool down and unwind  
What I'm feeling is a feeling  
That's just you down deep  
Got a man on my mind  
Sometimes I stand there  
Just starrin' into space  
And I talk about how I feel (oh yeah)  
Being there  
Yet I clearly see his face  
And I hold him and he's quite real  
Walk around in circles  
Without peace and without sleep  
Got a man on my mind  
I'm hungry for kisses  
I'm thirsty for love  
Got a man on my mind

Of life is everywhere you go

Right is bright  
When you're playing loco  
  
What's your hurry  
Who's to blame  
Right is bright  
When you're playing loco  
  
So you're down  
You end up a lonely man  
You're looking for a friend  
But they're all gone  
Let things go  
You'll find out  
What crazy means of madness  
Of life is everywhere you go

We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school.  
Teachers here, teachers there,  
Books and books, they are everywhere.  
  
Come on boys, we need to dance, we have got a good chance.  
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:  
  
Everybody, let's go to the "King",  
We can dance there, dance and eat an ice-cream.  
Everybody dancing all night long,  
Try to do it, sing a happy song.  
  
Music, dancing in the night, we can get so high,  
For no reason no long stop, now's the time to go to the top.  
  
It's a sweeter happy song, we'll sing all night long.  
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:  
Everybody, let's go to the "King",  
  
It's time to dance, it's time to sing, sing a happy song, a happy song.  
Let's go, let's go boys, come with me and sing, sing a happy song.  
  
Come on boys, we need to dance, we all have got a good, good chance.  
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more.  
Music sound in the night, we all can get so high,  
For no reason no long stop, now's the time to go to the top.

Let's go, let's go boys, come with me and sing, sing a happy song.  
Everybody, let's go to the "King",

Come on and listen to my tale  
It's a strange and sorry tale  
That's gonna rock you  
About a man, the drifting kind  
Let the story now unwind  
It's gonna shock you  
  
Some people said he was a ghost  
Wouldn't want to be his host  
Or just to meet him  
And if he ever came their way  
They'd be sticks and stones, I'd say  
That would grieve him  
  
He was a steppenwolf, a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf, forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf, with a forgotten past  
He was a steppenwolf, who found a love at last  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
The girl he met was out-of-sight  
Though she walked the streets at night  
He didn't mind it  
She seemed as happy as a song  
And if anything was wrong  
He didn't find it  
  
They used to laugh and dance and drink  
And not ever did he think of a payday  
No matter where they ever were  
Every day he spent with her was a hey-day  
  
He was a steppenwolf, and not a handsome man  
He was a steppenwolf, who didn't know her plan  
He was a steppenwolf, not very bright at all  
He was a steppenwolf, just riding for a fall  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
One day she said "it's time you knew  
That I started up with you  
For just one reason  
You're gonna do just what I want  
'cause there's something that I want  
And I ain't teasing  
My life is empty all around  
Nothing that I ever found  
Would fulfill me  
So for a while I'll be with you  
When I say that we're through  
You must kill me!"  
  
He was a steppenwolf, he cried "it isn't fair"  
He was a steppenwolf, "you know how much I care"  
He was a steppenwolf, she said "this is the deal"  
He was a steppenwolf, he saw this was for real  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
He was a steppenwolf, they spent a long last night  
He was a steppenwolf, and with a smile she died  
He was a steppenwolf, a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf, forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf


I want to live,  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold  
All these expressions I never give  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
I want to live  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold  
All these expressions I never give  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
I've been to Hollywood  
I've been to Redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old


What a beautiful morning  
Just to wake up beside you  
Is something I've missed for so long  
I'm so glad that you came back home  
  
Baby let me tell you  
How my days slipped away  
And how I was afraid of the night  
But now I'm alright  
  
I feel good  
Feeling like a lover should  
What else can I say  
Won't forget the day  
You came back to stay  
I feel so good (i feel good, I feel good, I feel good)  
Finally we understood  
You and me were meant  
True lovers from the start  
We can never part  
  
Our love is grown stronger  
More than any temptation  
In this world could possibly be  
There's no doubt 'cause it's plain to see  
  
I feel good  
Feeling like a lover should  
What else can I say  
Won't forget the day  
You came back to stay  
I feel so good (i feel good, I feel good, I feel good)  
Finally we understood  
You and me were meant  
True lovers from the start  
We can never part  
  
I feel good  
Feeling like a lover should  
What else can I say  
Won't forget the day  
You came back to stay  
I feel so good (i feel good, I feel good, I feel good)  
Finally we understood  
You and me...


He left on a boat  
Just to follow a dream  
He had to find  
You can't hold a man  
When he follows a dream  
That's on his mind  
I see a boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
Boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
I waited for him  
Such a very long time  
Don't know what for  
'Cause I should have known  
When he left on the boat  
We'll meet no more  
I see a boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
Boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
Boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
Boat on the river  
You're bound for the sea  
If you should find him  
Please greet him from me  
There were people who came  
And said it's really a shame  
Why did he take off  
To follow just a dream  
But I guess they were wrong  
In life you're sailing along  
And things don't turn out  
As simple as they seem  
Boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
I see a boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to the ocean  
Where to I can't say  
I see a boat on the river  
You're bound for the sea  
If you should find him  
Please greet him from me  
Boat on the river  
It's sailing away  
Down to...


I shall sing, sing my song  
Be it right, be it wrong  
In the night, in the day  
Anyhow it's out a sight  
  
I shall sing  
La la la la la la la la  
With my heart, with my soul  
For the young, for the old  
  
When I'm high, when I'm low  
When I'm fast, when I'm slow  
I shall sing  
I shall sing, sing my song  
  
Be it right, be it wrong  
In the day, in the night  
Anyhow it's out a sight  
I shall sing  
La la la la la la la la  
  
I shall sing, sing my song  
I shall sing, sing my song  
I shall sing, sing my song  
  
Be it right, be it wrong  
In the day, in the night  
Anyhow it's out a sight  
I shall sing  
La la la la


I'll be home for Christmas  
I'll be home just in time  
I can't wait 'till I see you  
Feel your heart next to mine  
  
We'll be together again like before  
You and I all alone  
I'll hold you close when I walk through that door  
I'll be home for Christmas  
  
We can stay by the fire  
With the lights turned down low  
We can watch happy children  
As they play in the snow  
  
Though I may be far away from you now  
Darling I promise this  
It wont be long 'till we're sharing a kiss  
I'll be home for Christmas  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
I'll be home Christmas time  
When you wait Christmas morning  
I'll be there by your side


I'm born again, I feel free  
No longer alone  
A bright light is shinning  
And shows me a world that I own  
I can see my way through  
I know I will walk beside you  
All those prayers of mine weren't in vain  
I'm born again  
I'm born again, I feel free  
There's a quite different me  
No longer I'm tossed like a ship  
On an unruly sea  
I've been blessed with a love  
That's meant for the rest of my time  
All those prayers they were not in vain  
I'm born again  
Since love touched my heart right  
My life has a meaning  
I feel I'm no longer drifting in space  
I believe once again that there is a tomorrow  
A brand new tomorrow, I know I can face  
I'm born again, I feel free  
No longer alone  
A bright light is shinning  
And shows me a world that I own  
I can see my way through  
I know I will walk beside you  
All those prayers of mine weren't in vain  
I'm born again  
All those prayers they weren't in vain  
'cause I'm born again

He's a man of means by no means

All of their children and all of their names

Her name was Lady Godiva  
A lady so brave and so strong  
Her husband the Earl of Mercia  
He treated her terribly wrong  
  
She's a lady  
She's a lady  
She rode naked on horseback  
To stop him from his tax increase  
  
But people in town closed their curtains  
Than prison for living in peace  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a lady  
She's a lady  
She's a lady, Lady Godiva  
The hero of Coventry  
L-L-Lady Lady Godiva  
She rode into history  
  
Then sneaking a glance through the window  
Was a guy they called Peeping Tom  
He caught a glimpse and was blinded  
Curiosity sometimes is wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People liked Lady Godiva  
Respectfully looking away  
They honored incredible courage  
Her legend lives until today  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

They got the luxury money can buy  
They're living like kings and queens  
The whole world's crying whenever they cry  
They smile when they smile at scenes  
What's left of all that glamour and glory  
You find behind the doors in hollywood  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall  
Living like a moviestar  
I don't think i go too far  
If i say they're lonely after all  
Too much of everything  
Too much to choose  
They finally lose control  
Crime and insanity, scandals and booze  
They're dying 'fore getting old  
What's left of all that glamour and glory  
You find behind the doors in hollywood  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall  
Living like a moviestar  
I don't think i go too far  
If i say they're lonely after all  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall...

She left her husband flat  
He wasn't tough enough  
She took her boys along  
Cause they were mean and strong

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
While shepherds watch their flock by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seem to come from afar.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
"Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace."  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.  
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold 'n' dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".  
Oh My Lord...

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain  
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain  
The dark days are gone and the bright days are here

My world is filled with oceans  
Oceans of fantasy  
The never never land of emotions  
Come down and follow me  
You'll see the secret places  
Where all the rivers end  
And pirate ships of old  
Filled with diamonds and with gold  
Just waiting for a friend  
  
All you can hear is the music of stillness  
And pure harmony  
Magical mirrors reflecting the light  
That colors the sea  
You'll be surrounded by angel like creatures  
Who tend to your dreams  
Deeper and deeper you fall in a trance  
Much more real  
Much more real than it seems  
  
Come share with me the oceans  
Oceans of fantasy  
Where you can lose your soul forever  
Like in a melody  
  
Oceans of fantasy, oceans of fantasy  
Oceans of fantasy, oceans of fantasy

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago  
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the bible like a preacher  
Full of ecstasy and fire  
But he also was the kind of teacher  
Women would desire  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
There was a cat that really was gone  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
It was a shame how he carried on  
  
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar  
But the cassock he danced really wunderbar  
In all affairs of state he was the man to please  
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze  
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer  
Though she'd heard the things he'd done  
She believed he was a holy healer  
Who would heal her son  
  
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger  
For power became known to more and more people,  
The demands to do something about this outrageous  
Man became louder and louder.  
  
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies  
But the ladies begged "don't you try to do it, please"  
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms  
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms  
Then one night some men of higher standing  
Set a trap, they're not to blame  
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding  
And he really came  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They put some poison into his wine  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They didn't quit, they wanted his head  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
And so they shot him till he was dead  
  
Oh, those Russians


Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
He said he had to work, so I went to the show alone.  
They turned down the lights and turned the projector on.  
And just as the news of the world started to begin,  
I saw my darling and my best friend walking in.  
  
Although I was sitting right there they didn't see me.  
And so they both sat right down in the front of me.  
And when he kissed her lips then I almost died.  
And in the middle of the color cartoon I started to cry.  
  
Oh sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
  
And so I got on up and slowly I walked on home,  
And Mama saw the tears and said "Baby what is wrong".  
And so just to keep from telling her a lie,  
I just said "Sad movies makes me cry".  
  
Oh sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry


Long time ago, when I was a young  
Boy,  
I saw that movie, "Mutiny on theBounty"  
Starring my idol, Marlon Brando.  
And I felt a yearning for that  
Great adventure.  
So many nights I woke up out of adream  
A dream of blue seas, white sands,  
Paradies birds, butterflies, and  
Beautiful warm-hearted girls.  
  
Sun of Jamaika, the dreams of  
Malaika,  
Your love is my sweet memory.  
  
Sun of Jamaika, Blue Lady Malaika,  
Someday I'll return, wait and see  
Walk in the sand and I'm happy  
With you  
We shall be loving and true.  
Oh I sure love Malaika,  
With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true,  
Yeah true.  
But now as I grew older  
The burning desire became so strong  
That I bought a tiket to fly home  
And then I found you  
And we found an eternal love  
Right from the beginning.  
The stars falling down from the Lagoon of gold,  
The palms swaying under the moon,  
We were swimming out into the  
Crystal sea,  
In that fateful night I thought to  
Myself  
I'll do everthing I can, save  
Every dime,  
And one day I'll return,  
And then I'll stay forever, forever.  
  
Sun of Jamaika, the dreams of  
Malaika,  
Your love is my sweet memory.  
Sun of Jamaika, Blue Lady Malaika,  
Someday I'll return, wait and see  
Walk in the sand and I'm happy  
With you  
We shall be loving and true.  
Oh I sure love Malaika,  
With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true,  
Yeah true.


The first Noel the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the east, beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel

I never thought that a love could be so strong  
It could ever make me, think about leaving home  
I can't help myself your lovin' bout to drive me mad  
One more night like last night, I might have to pack my bags  
  
Bout to make me leave home boy  
  
Got my mind so  
Gettin together with this love, boy it just ain't right  
I ain't got the strength to turn a good lovin loose  
But I never met a man in my life who could whoop it to me like you do  
  
Bout to make me leave home boy  
Got a taste of forbidden fruit  
And I can't turn it loose  
What is this good thing you carry around with you  
That makes a girl want to act a fool  
  
Got that love technique that really really cracks me up  
Seeing you once or twice a week, boy it just ain't enough.


Love came and hit me  
Straight on the lips  
The longer we're kissin'  
The better it gets, and baby that's all right  
You got me standing beside myself  
You know it ain't like me  
It's like I'm somebody else  
But baby that's all right  
  
You're not the man I was lookin' for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you, it feels so good  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I plead guilty babe, of this terrible crime  
You been lovin' me all of this time  
I must've been blind  
What's gonna happen?  
What'll I do?  
Whatever it is, I wanna do it with you  
I feel just fine  
  
You're not the man I was lookin' for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you babe, it feels so good  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
And ain't it peculiar how loves comes about?  
When you're not lookin', you'd better look out!  
  
You're not the man I was lookin' for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Feels so good now that I got you to myself  
I'm gonna keep you for myself  
Now that I got you  
I don't wanna let you go  
Don't wanna let you go  
  
You're not the man I was looking for  
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you babe, it feels so good  
I don't wanna let you go  
Now that I got you babe, I don't wanna let you go


Had a fight with my daughter  
She flew off in a rage  
Third time this week  
Don't tell me it's the age  
Don't know how I lost her  
I only know that it's a shame  
Ever since her daddy left  
The girl ain't been the same  
All at once I hear your voice  
And time just slips away  
Nothing they could say can hold me here  
Take me where I only feel  
The wind across my face  
Let me know there's someplace left for me  
Waiting there for me  
Ah, who am I kiddin'  
I should have known he'd never leave  
The time we spend together  
Is harder than the time between  
You wouldn't think it could hurt so  
To see 'em out the other day  
If that's what he calls leavin'  
I guess I threw it all away  
All at once I hear your voice  
And time just slips away  
Nothing they could say can hold me here  
Take me where I only feel  
The wind across my face  
Let me know there's someplace left for me  
Waiting just for me  
They say women, we're the stronger  
Somehow we always make it through  
Hell, that ain't what I feel right now  
I don't even think it's true  
To me there's lots more broken  
Than anyone can really see  
Why the angels turn their backs on some  
It's a mystery to me  
All at once I hear your voice  
And time just slips away  
Nothing they could say can hold me here  
Take me where I only feel  
The wind across my face  
Let me know there's someplace left for me  


Verse 1  
I am an old woman  
Named after my mother  
My old man is another  
Child that's grown old  
  
If dreams were thunder  
And lightning was desire  
This old house would've burned down  
A long time ago  
  
Chorus: Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
Verse 2  
When I was a young girl  
Well I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at  
Just a free ramblin' man  
But that was a long time  
And no matter how I tried  
Those years just flow by  
Like a broken down dam  
  
Chorus: Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
Verse 3  
There's flies in the kitchen  
I can hear them there buzzin'  
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening  
And have nothing to say  
  
Chorus Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go


If you don't love her, you'd better let her go  
You'll never fool her, you're bound to let it show  
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake  
Everything in return, you just preserve her  
When you serve her a little tenderness  
If she's a woman, she'll try to make it last  
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast  
There's no reason here, no treason here  
Just the way a woman's mind, well she has no name  
She has no shame, she just loves you  
It's not easy to undo what's done  
Or to speak too freely to just anyone  
And if this takes more than you bargained for  
Boy it's time you learn, not to talk so loud  
Walk so proud when you're comin' on  


I don't' know why it should be so hard  
Givin' up this circle dance  
Worn out steps from long ago  
Don't give love a chance  
It's a bitter heirloom handed down  
These twisted parts we play  
  
I'm not her and you're not him  
It just comes out that way  
Can't go back to make things right  
Though I wish I'd understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
We did the best we could  
  
I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say  
And a little kid believes  
After a while I learned that love  
Must be a thing that leaves  
I tried so hard just to hold you near  
Was as good as I could be  
  
Even when I had you here  
You stayed so far from me  
Can't go back to make things right  
Though I wish I'd understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
  
You did the best you could  
Now that this has occurred to me  
I just wanted you to know  
I've been too faithful all my life  
It's time to let you go


All I ever wanted  
Was a love to be true  
More than just enough to get me by  
I want a love to see me through  
  
I don't need another well spent night  
Another clever, sideways glance  
I wanna look my baby in the eye  
And know there's nothin' left to chance  
  
Well if you're tired of being lonely  
Beat up and confused  
Darlin' there is only  
One thing you can do  
Come to me  
I'll be the one who's waiting  
Come to me  
I got what you need  
Won't you come to me  
There won't be no hesitating  
I know what you mean to me  
  
I'm gonna hold out for the one I want  
Ain't gonna settle for less  
Cause the kind of love I'm lookin' for, baby  
You can't fake, you can't finesse  
  
I ain't lookin' for the kind of man, baby  
Can't stand a little shaky ground  
He'll give me fire and tenderness  
And got the guts to stick around  
  
So if you're tired of bein' lonely  
Beat up and confused  
Darlin' there is only  
One thing you can do  
Come to me  
I got what you need  
Come to me  
Won't be no hesitating  
I know what you mean to me


You bring me roses  
You give me kisses  
You bring me moons and stars  
That shine so high up in the sky  
My heart is beating wild and crazy  
  
Hope that I can find  
A cure for this love  
Could be you want me  
Could be you care  
Could be the words you say,  
Are things I just want to hear  
  
You me nervous, got me shaking  
Maybe I can find  
A cure for this love  
La la la la  
  
Doctor, doctor  
Give me healing, so I can stop this feeling  
It's getting so much stronger  
And I just can't go on much longer  
  
Doctor please  
Find me a way out of love  
When the phone rings  
And no one answers  
  
The letters comeback saying  
"Lover cannot be found"  
Don't go looking, don't bother searching  
You see it's 'cause your baby  
Found herself a cure for love  
La la la la


There are angels singing low inside my head  
Cool tango blue and samba red  
I want to scratch your name upon my wall  
Cause I'm drowning here beneath love's waterfall  
  
Deep water  
Deep water  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
We are walking like the waves beside the sea  
There are oceans in my eyes that you can't see  
And my arms reach out for you into the dark  
I feel your skin where my nails left their mark  
  
Deep water  
Deep water  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
Souls alike  
Hands alike  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
Souls alike  
Hands alike


This old house is falling down around my ears  
I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone you hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pulled me like the moon  
Pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my better side  
  
What days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
I see you the street and in company  
Why don't you come and rest your mind with me  
I'm living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day


Do I ever cross your mind  
Darlin' do you ever see  
Some situation somewhere, somehow  
Triggers your memory  
And do you ever wonder  
What became of all the time  
Honey, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
  
Do you ever want to know  
Do all dreams go on endlessly  
Or do they just run down somehow  
And gradually become the custody  
Of that melancholy jailer for the time, oh no  
Do I ever, darlin', ever cross your mind  
Do I ever cross your mind  
Uninvited  
When you're lonely  
Or does it only happen to me  
Darlin', do you ever want to know  
What became of all the time  
I wanna know, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
Oh, baby, baby  
  
Little darlin'  
Do you ever wonder  
What became of all the time  
Please tell me, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
Do I ever, ever cross your mind


Come around cryin' that you just can't win  
You thought this one was different' now it's gone again  
You just can't believe, baby  
Why's it happenin' to me now  
  
You step out on the track in the pouring rain,  
And when you get run over will you blame the train?  
You just can't deny, baby,  
Life is passing you by, baby  
  
And don't you think you've had enough?  
Ain't it time to get a different view?  
You can't just wait around for what you want  
It's all about the way you choose  
Ain't nobody else that can make things right  
Baby, it's down to you  
  
Everywhere you look they're trying' to do you in  
You just can't understand, they used to be your friend  
It's always the same, baby  
Someone else is to blame, baby  
  
Still ain't got a clue to where it all goes down  
'Cause what you're dishing out is coming back around  
Same old song, baby  
Gone all too long now  
  
Dont'cha think that you've had enough?  
Ain't it time to get a different view  
You can't just wait around for what you want  
It's all about the way you choose  
Ain't nobody else that can make things right  
Baby, it's down to you  
Down to you  
  
Dont'cha think that you've had enough?  
Ain't it time to get a different view  
Can't just wait around for what you want  
It's all about the way you choose  
Ain't nobody else that can make things right  
Baby, it's down to you  
Down to you, honey


Come my love  
Come bravely to me  
Let your heart be still  
For our time  
Has come my tender one  
To be free of will  
  
And fly  
Blind on fearless love  
Let them wild winds blow  
We'll shine  
On all we're fearful of  
Then we'll let it go  
Let it go  
  
Skippin' stones  
Across the great unknown  
Safe at water's edge  
Don't look down, baby  
We're gonna leave this losin' town  
(and) leap out from the ledge  
  
And fly  
Blind on fearless love  
Let them wild winds blow  
We'll shine  
On all we're fearful of  
Then we'll let it go  
Let it go


The man I'm lovin' don't worry 'bout me runnin' around  
You won't ever find my baby hustlin' after me all over town  
You don't have to shout, you don't even have to call  
Knows I'm comin' home even if I got to crawl  
He'll get me when he wants me, he's the finest lovin' man around  
When he gets up in the morning or when he comes home late at night  
You know the man's always hungry, knows I'm gonna cook it up just right  
He don't ever hurry, he just takes his time  
Just a little taste is all it takes to make him mine  
He'll get it when he wants it, he's the finest lovin' man around  
Some women they act just like their men will never amount to no good  
You know they are always on the cheat  
And never treat him like a good woman should  
You want him to do you right, honey, that ain't the way, yeah  
You got to love him all night, you do just what he say  
And you get just what you give out, that's the only way to gain his place  
Now me and my baby, we always know just what we're puttin' down  
And we know we'll be together  
Till the day when something better comes around  
Till that day comes you won't hear me complaining, yeah  
I'll take him like he is 'cause you know I can't change him  
I'll love him best I can, he's the finest lovin' man around  
Oh yeah yeah  


The first time I brought you home  
My mama said he ain't good enough  
I don't want my girl to be alone  
But I wonder is he good enough  
I-I-I was doin some worryin' too  
And I was thinkin' thinkin'  
Am I good enough for you  
  
The first time that I loved you  
I know it was a little rough  
But when at last we were still  
You asked was it good enough  
And I cried and looked in your eyes of blue  
Cause I been prayin' prayin'  
I was good enough for you  
Good enough for you  
  
Now I got to set your mind at ease  
Got to stop your insecurities  
Cause if anything  
You're too good for me  
  
Now it's strange how time's gone by  
Since the day that we fell in love  
And still some times we hafta ask ourselves  
Was it good enough  
And time is bound to make us see  
Just how good  
Good enough can be  
Good enough can be  
Good enough for you baby  
Good enough for me  
  
Now, It won't be long  
Good enough for me  
Keep me warm, baby  
For me  
Good enough for me


Any old time  
You got your tuned in  
Baby by your side  
And your pretty little cool ride  
It feels so good  
You got the top pulled in  
Wind in your hair  
Destination you don't care  
  
Now move it on up  
You know it's steerin' all rite  
Foot's to the floor  
But you think that you can domore  
Wind shield clean  
And the nite is so brite  
Baby so near  
And She's givin' you a green lite  
  
Great sound on the radio  
She feels something  
Now you know there's no place that you'd rather be  
  
Great sounds..  
  
Any old time  
You got your tuned in  
Baby by your side  
And your pretty little cool ride


Hey!  
Shut up.  
Don't lie to me.  
Hey!  
Mister, how do you do.  
Oh pardon me I thought I knew you.  
Would you stand back baby 'cause I want to get a better look.  
The big man who couldn't handle the little bit of love you took.  
  
Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.  
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?  
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?  
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.  
  
Oh darling, I love you so.  
I told you yes, and then you told me no.  
Baby, how can you say  
You should be free and I should pay and pay  
And you talk and talk about you and what you need  
But sooner or later your love is gonna make me bleed.  
  
Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.  
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?  
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?  
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.  
Oh, oh.  
  
Talk on, talk on, but love is what you need.  
And sooner or later that love is gonna make you bleed.  
  
Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.  
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?  
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?  
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.  
But don't you run away baby.


I ain't blue, baby  
Just a little bit lonesome for some lovin'  
Everything is fine  
Just don't want to be all by myself  
On a rainy day  
I'm feelin' kind of funny  
Dreaming 'bout some loverman who'll call me honey  
Yeah and a good lookin' man  
My heart inside  
A lonely smile and lovin' in his eyes  
No I ain't blue, baby  
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again  
Everything is fine  
Just don't want to be all by myself  
Sit around the house  
Readin' magazines  
All the time thinkin' 'bout those same sweet dreams  
Yeah, walk down the street  
My heart jumps a beat  
Every time I see some sweet man I want to meet  
No I ain't blue, baby  
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again  
Everything is fine  
I just don't want to be all by myself  
  


Where were you when I was fallin' down  
Buzzin' round your heart  
Why'd you wait till I was moving on  
To come out of the dark  
  
To say I'm what you need  
And you could spend your life with me  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I can't help you now  
(sorry baby, I can't help you)  
No, I can't help you now  
(keep away, I've fallen in love)  
Maybe there was a time  
But sometimes time runs out  
And I can't help you know  
  
Forty days since I stopped countin' the days  
And countin' the ways that I loved you  
Good long while since I found  
Good enough reasons to stop believin' that you  
Are what I really want  
And now that you you do baby, I don't  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now you sayin' the one you need  
And you could spend your life with me  
But I can't help you know,no  
  
I can't help you know  
  
Baby there was a time  
And I wish I could somehow  
But I can't help you  
Can't help you know


Fate is mighty cruel  
Where true love is concerned  
It seems you give out more  
Than you ever have returned  
Lately I have tried  
To make it on my own  
Another night has passed  
Looks like I'm bound to be alone  
Bound to be alone  
  
Now solitude is fine  
When you really need it  
When your soul is dry  
Sometimes loneliness can feed it  
When you need a lover  
You know there's nothing else will do  
When you need love most  
You know it turns it's back on you  
  
Oh, I can make it through without your company  
I only wish I knew why you won't comfort me  
I thought that I could count on you  
To hear me crying out  
I guess that's one comfort  
I will learn to do without  
  
Falling love too easily  
But never quite so fast  
So you are not the first and, lord  
You sure won't be the last  
The thing about the situation  
That makes me feel so sad  
I could've been the best old friend  
That you have ever had  
I could've been the best old friend  
That you have ever had


I know you don't love me no more  
No, no more, and I don't  
(Don't) want to be hurt anymore  
Anymore, yeah, yeah  
I've loved so hard, everything I did was no joy, if I can't  
Love you right, baby, I don't have to love you at all  
  
I know you don't want me no more, no more  
No, no more  
And it had to be someone loving you more  
Lovin' you more  
Ain't no use in me cryin' now, all because you have put me down  
If you don't want me no more, baby, ain't no use in me hanging around


I need love  
And I search it everyplace I go  
And lately I been in a zone  
It's got a will of its own  
But right now I'm here to discuss  
Just what you think about us  
I need love, I need love  
  
And I'm checkin everything I see  
You know at times I want to take on three  
That's just the way I could be  
I let you know about that  
Just so you know where I'm at  
I need love, I need love  
  
It's always been this way and ain't' nothin'  
Gonna change it  
And ain't nothing you can try  
I need love, I need love  
And I'm takin' every chance I man  
And baby you could make my day  
  
There's just one thing I should say  
Now that's it's all said and done  
You know I do need to run  
I need love, I need love


You took my love and ran away  
What did you expect me to say  
I gave you everything I could  
But you weren't giving up, baby  
What you should  
I Sho do...Need You  
I Sho Do...Want You  
I'm in need of what you've got  
It makes my blood boiling hot  
You told me baby, A long time ago  
That you'd never, ever leave me  
Never, no more  
I Sho Do...Need You  
I Sho Do...Want You  
I Sho Do...Wish For You  
I Sho Do...Walk the Floor All Night Long  
When you see me, baby standing alone  
Come and help me baby, Cause I'm out on my own  
You see it ain't easy in the streets  
But what you've got baby, could help me to my feet  
I Sho Do...Need You  
I Sho Do...Want You  
I Sho Do...Wish For You  
I Sho Do...Walk the Floor All  
Night Long  


Well they all said Louise was not half bad  
It was written on the walls and window shades  
And how she'd act the little girl  
A deceiver, don't believe her that's her trade  
Sometimes a bottle of perfume,  
Flowers and maybe some lace  
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets  
Their intentions were easily traced  
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried  
But women like Louise they get by  
  
Well everybody thought it kind of sad  
When they found Louise in her room  
They'd always put her down below their kind  
Still some cried when she died this afternoon  
Louise rode home on the mail train  
Somewhere to the south I heard it said  
Too bad it ended so ugly,  
Too bad she had to go this way  
Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight  
So good night Louise, good night


Sittin' in front of your house,  
Like rain in early dawn  
Workin' on a love letter  
Got my radio on.  
  
Got my eye on your window pane  
And I smoked a pile of cigarettes.  
Mercy, mercy but love is strange  
And you haven't even kissed me yet.  
  
Look comes to push,  
Push comes to shove,  
Shove comes to touch,  
Touch will come to love.  
  
Workin' on a love letter,  
Listenin' to a love song,  
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,  
Got my radio on, radio, radio  
  
Hope you get the message baby.  
I know that you're gonna let me in.  
It's wierd in your neighborhood  
If this is war, then I'm gonna win!  
  
Look comes to push,  
Push comes to shove,  
Shove comes to touch,  
Touch will come to love.  
  
Why don't sit waitin'  
Why don't behavin'  
Love's waiting in the car,  
In the car and rain now.  
  
Workin' on a love letter,  
Listenin' to a love song,  
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,  
Got my radio on, radio, radio  
  
Guitar solo  
  
Look comes to push,  
Push comes to shove,  
Shove comes to touch,  
Touch will come to love.  
  
(3 times with adlibs)  
Workin' on a love letter,  
Listenin' to a love song,  
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,  
Got my radio on, radio, radio


Who'll take the only hearts they got  
And throw them into the fire?  
Who'll risk their own self respect  
In the name of desire?  
Who'll regret everything they've done  
And who will get the bill?  
  
Lovers will  
Who'll hurt each other all the time  
And never give it a thought?  
Who'll lie about where they've been  
And hope they never get caught?  
Who'll say each other's kisses  
No longer thrill?  
Lovers will  
Lovers will do almost anything  
  
For the thrill that only love can bring  
If love is a healer, who'll be the first ones ill?  
Lovers will  
  
Who'll never know what they've got  
Until it's just about gone?  
And whose arms will gather up what's left  
To carry on?  
  
And who'll stalk that little bit of love  
That hasn't been killed?  
Lovers will


You come home late from work, baby  
You wonder why it ain't on the table  
After the day that I've had  
I don't believe I'm able  
You give me every little reason in the book  
But there's one thing that I think you've overlooked  
You say you're tired, well so am I  
Baby you've got to try and  
Meet halfway or we ain't gonna make it, baby  
Meet halfway if you want to get it right  
Meet halfway cause I ain't gonna take it, baby  
Meet halfway in the middle of the night  
Our love is kind of stalled, baby  
  
But it ain't about the sex  
I'd trade the roses and the negligees  
If we could just connect  
I go deeper when you look into my eyes  
There's a place where neither one of us can hide  
And it's up to us to reinvent the game  
Love it when you call my name and  
Meet halfway, ain't no doubt about it, baby  
Meet halfway, and we're halfway home  
Meet halfway, got to scream and shout it, baby  
Meet me halfway and I'll shake you to the bone


There is an aching in my head  
From the bed I can't get used to  
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread  
As I spend my first night alone without you  
  
Honey, half of me has gone away  
With all the love I learned to cling to  
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way  
To live the rest of my life alone without you  
  
You taught me how to live  
How to be myself  
And how to give  
Oh, but now it's you  
Who's given up on giving  
  
You've lost the thing, no one to teach  
Changing and now you're out of reach  
And my life tonight just don't seem worth living  
No, no  
  
I've been sitting learning how to read  
Cause back in school I never liked to  
It's just one of those little things I'm gonna need  
As I put my life together, baby, without you


A lady stands before an open window  
Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching his restless day  
  
He turns from his window to me  
Sad smile his apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
Still he spares me words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings  
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind  
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's a world you know  
There's a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To lock you safe behind it's open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see  
Now my kind words find their way back to me  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's world you know  
Got a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
This is my opening farewell.


A friend of mine she cries at night,  
And she calls me on the phone  
Sees babies everywhere she goes  
And she wants one of her own.  
She's waited long enough she says  
And still she can't decide  
Pretty soon she'll have to choose and it tears her up inside  
She's scared, scared she'll run out of time.  
  
I see my folks, they're getting old,  
And I watch their bodies change  
I know they see the same in me,  
And it makes us both feel strange  
No matter how you tell yourself,  
It's what we all go through  
Those eyes are pretty hard to take when they're staring' back at you.  
Scared to run out of time.  
  
[Chorus]  
When did the choices get so hard?  
With so much more at stake.  
Life gets mighty precious when there's less of it to waste.  
Hummmm  
Scared to run out of time.  
  
Just when I thought I'd had enough  
And all my tears were shed  
No promise left unbroken,  
There were no painful words unsaid.  
You came along and showed me  
How to leave it all behind  
You opened up my heart again and then much to my surprise.  
  
I found love, baby,  
Love in the nick of time.  
  
I found love, darling,  
Love in the nick of time  
  
I found love, baby,  
Love in the nick of time.


Yes, I'm lonely- hope you didn't catch it  
Don't want to be down where I last behaved  
I broke his heart now I can't patch it  
This time it's grave.  
I kept track of all the love that I gave him  
And on paper, well, it looked pretty good  
He left a note that said he couldn't stay here  
As if I could...  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.  
One of these days I thought we'd get it together  
After all that boy was made for me  
But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers  
Little bird got free.  
He always said my love was one sided  
I tried to keep up with supply and demand  
But there was one way that pie was divided  
It was a big piece plan.  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.  
Well, now I'm getting desperate, baby, getting illeagal  
I got the law doggies on my trail  
The hawk's out and I could use an eagle  
To go my bail.  
You say you're itching baby, so go ahead and scratch it  
But if it jumps off, don't look at me  
You swore to God that I couldn't catch it  
But your dog's got fleas.  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.


She don't need anybody to tell her she's pretty.  
She's heard it every single day of her life.  
He's got to wonder what she sees in himwhen there's so many others standing in
line.  
She gives herself to him, but he's still on the outside.  
She's alone in this world,  
She's nobody's girl.  
She's nobody's girl.  
  
She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night  
Then she disappears for weeks at a time.  
It's just enough to keep him wanting more  
But never is he satisfied.  
  
And he's left to pick up the pieces,  
Wondering what does he do this for.  
She's off in her own little world,  
She's nobody's girl.  
She's nobody's girl.  
  
He said "Before I met her, I didn't love nothin.  
'I could take it or leave it, that was okay,  
But she brings out a want in meFor things  
I didn't even know that I need.  
"She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to,  
With anyone.  
  
You know, she wants it all.  
Still she gets all upset over the least little thing.  
When you hurt her, it makes you feel so small.  
And she's a walking contradiction,  
But I ache for her inside.  
She's fragile like a string of pearls.  
She's nobody's girl.  
She's fragile like a string of pearls.  
She's nobody's girl.  
She's nobody's girl.She's nobody's girl.


Well I'm calling you  
'Cause you deserve to know  
You are not the reason that I had to go,  
Late at night in these hotel rooms  
I think of all I've lost,  
What I've put you through  
  
And if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to  
  
I've got a guilty heart  
And a troubled mind  
No matter where I go  
You're never far behind  
I'd like to think  
That you've forgiven me  
But forgiveness ain't enough  
To wash my conscience clean  
  
Oh and if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to  
  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to


I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
One chance intervention, see what it can signify  
The slightest misapprehension, baby  
And we'd have passed each other by  
When I heard your sweet voice callin'  
Saw your light come shinin' through  
I couldn't stop my heart from turning  
Churnin' out my love for you, my love to you.  
  
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
True love or perfection  
It seems like it's overdue  
Then just when you least expect it  
It comes sneakin' up on you  
When I thought that I was dreaming  
Felt your body close to mine  
Now love takes on a different meaning,  
Together till the end of time.  
  
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.


Seems like such a long time, since I held you in my arms  
And felt you close and warm beside me  
Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache  
And the memory of you inside me  
Darling, I've never been so blue  
I've tried to see it through, there's nothing I can do  
I won't make it on my own, so won't you please hurry home  
'Cause nothing seems to matter without you  
Last time I saw you, there was nothing we could say  
We knew it was a time for a change  
A time to think you said that night and I lied and said, "All right"  
And I left you in the morning, I watched you in the window  
And Mexico will never be the same  
It was time to be apart, but somehow it seems this heart of mine  
Will never find a way to live without you  
And now I'm out here on the road and I'm feeling bought and sold  
And tonight I just can't but think about you  
Darling, I've never been so blue  
I've tried to see it through, there's nothing I can do  
I won't make it on my own, so darling won't you hurry home  
Because nothing seems to matter without you  
No, nothing seems to matter without you  


There's a brand new dance  
That just hit this town  
Makes you feel so good  
  
This dance they call the round and round  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down  
You know the kids got a bloodhound  
Out on the playing ground  
  
And when they want to have some fun  
They start to goin round and round  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down  
I got an elevator man  
In the heart of town  
  
And when he's feeling right  
He will carry you round and round  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down  
Baby don't be jealous  
When I come to town  
  
I'm just a country girl  
Everybody's tryin' to push poor me around  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down


Just another homesick child  
Tired of running wild  
Ready to stand trial and move on  
Though I'm guilty in your sight  
Have some mercy tonight  
I can't make it through the fight alone  
  
Oh but lord, no don't make it easy  
Keep me working till I work it on out  
Just please shine enought light on me  
Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt  
Keep me out of the Shadow of Doubt  
As I try to make some sense  
Of this world I'm up against  
Well I know my best defense is your love  
When the struggle gets insane  
And the lesson's full of pain  
Keep me calling out your name with Love  
  
Oh but lord, no don't make it easy  
Keep me workin' till I work it on out  
Just please won't you shine  
enough light on me  
Til I'm free from this shadow of Doubt  
  
Well I whisper in the dark  
From the bottom of my heart  
And I'm searchin for one star to shine  
I will shout from mountain high  
And I'll reach into the sky  
Til you open up my eyes so blind  
  
Oh but lord no, Don't make it easy  
Keep me workin' til I work it on out  
Just please, please shine enough light on me  
'Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt  
keep me out of the Shadow.....


In the shadow of your father  
Sweet brown eyes of the one I love  
I can't wait another minute baby  
To do the things that we never done  
Everybody gets hungry sometimes  
Your love is like a kettle on  
In the shadow of your father  
Guess I get a little sad sometimes  
Shake a little for me baby  
Take me to the water when my well runs dry  
Shake a little for me baby  
Just a little now  
Just a little now  
Everybody gets lonely sometimes  
Guess a stranger is a friend in need  
In the shadow of this New York skyline  
All these stories looking down on me  
Everybody feels the water rising  
Could go under, I'll enjoy the ride  
Ah when you're dancing for me now baby  
I don't feel so small against the tide  
Shake a little for me baby  
Take me to the water when my well runs dry  
Shake a little for me baby  
Shake a little for me baby  
Take me to the water when my cup runs dry  
Shake a little for me baby  
Just a little now  
Just a little now  
Just a little now


So far  
There was not a second thought  
No heart  
Ever got close enough  
You are  
Watching as I am caught  
In a moment off-guard  
  
So close  
I can nearly taste it  
Suppose  
This is that one promised love  
God knows  
All that I've wasted now  
Never letting it start  
  
Now all my resistance  
I feel it slip away  
Now all of the distance  
Ever less with every day by day  
  
So far  
There was no connection  
No spark  
Out of which a fire grows  
I start  
In your direction I'm  
Ever so close  
  
Now all my resistance  
I feel it slip away  
Now all of the distance  
Ever less with every day by day  
  
So far, I have never been  
So close


When will I learn to take you on my journey  
When will I see that you belong to me  
When will I learn to take you on my journey  
When will I see that you belong with me  
  
Sweet Forgiveness  
How could go my babe  
I never really knew how I needed you, but you were right there  
(I don't know the rest)  
  
Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me.  
When you hold me close,  
And you say, "That's all over."  
You don't go looking back,  
You don't hold the cards to stack.  
Cause you mean what you say.  
  
Sweet forgiveness, you help me see.  
I'm not near as bad,  
As I sometimes appear to be.  
When you hold me close,  
And you say, "That's all over,  
"And I still love you."  
  
There's no way that I could make up,  
For those angry words I said.  
Sometimes it gets to hurting,  
And the pain goes to my head.  
  
Sweet forgiveness, dear God above.  
I say we all deserve,  
A taste of this kind of love.  
Someone who'll hold our hand,  
And whisper, "I understand,  
"And I still love you."


Bonnie Raitt-Takin' My Time  
(Bill Payne)  
I'm takin' my time  
So please don't rush me.  
Tryin' to sort out some things I didn't know existed.  
I've been here before,  
I know where the traps lie.  
You only take what's there 'cause the rest doesn't matter.  
Well I'm tired of talk,  
So please don't push me.  
You know I want the same kinda things that you do.  
You're wasting your time,  
The way you come to me.  
Slow down your rhymes and try to reason  
Can't make things move any faster,  
By second wishing them to death.  
You seem to be living on the level.  
It's decent enough,  
You got what you wanted.  
So why do you tell me, that I'm on the wrong track?  
I'm doin' the best I can do.  
I try to out guess  
The situation  
That I know your not even fully aware of.  
And I want you to know,  
If it keeps on this way,  
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.  
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.  


The time has come  
Before our yesterday is here  
I said, the time has come now baby  
For you and me to get a few things clear  
  
I might be right or I might be wrong  
What does it matter if I'm weak or strong  
I might be rich I might be poor  
Please don't ya ever close that door  
  
Come home and talk to me  
Tell me what is on your mind  
You better tell me baby  
Tell me while there's still enough time  
  
Well I gave you everything that I had  
Now you're sayin' you're a little bit mad at me  
I taught ya everything I knew  
There ain't too much more I can do for you  
You feel there's somethin' wrong?  
Then you'll have to tell me it's wrong  
  
You know it too  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
Don't hold it in  
Come on baby, I'm still your friend  
  
Why don't you talk to me  
Tell me what is on your mind  
Now ya better tell me baby  
Tell me while there's still enough time  
  
I might be right or I might be wrong  
What does it matter if I'm weak or strong  
I might be rich I might be poor  
Please don't ya ever close that door  
  
Come home and talk to me  
Tell me what is on your mind  
You better tell me baby  
Tell me while there's still enough time


Gonna get into it, babe  
Down where it's tangled and dark  
Way on into it, baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it, babe  
Honey, that's the hardest part  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up your heart  
Gonna get into it, baby  
Gonna give them demons a call, babe  
Way on into it, baby  
Gonna find out once and for all  
Gonna get a little risky, baby  
Honey, that's my favorite part  
When we get through it, baby  
Gonna give up our hearts  
Gonna give up our hearts  
Well, there's no turnin' back  
No turnin' back this time  
Well, there's no turnin' back  
No turnin' back  
No use in runnin'  
It's always the same  
You can count on the panic  
It's the faces that change  
We might have a chance  
To get this love off the block  
So take a deep breath  
Let's look under that rock, now baby  
Gonna get into it, baby  
Down where it's tangled and dark, no, no, baby  
Way on into it, baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it, baby  
Honey, that's the hardest part  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up  
If we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up, you're gonna give up  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up your heart  
Gonna give up your heart  
Gonna give up your heart  
Ooh babe, gonna give up  
You're gonna give up, you're gonna give up  
Gonna give up, gonna give up your heart  
Hey baby, gonna give up, gonna give up  
Gonna give up, gonna give up  
Gonna give up your heart  


You didn't have to love me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
  
If you took your love somewhere else  
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death  
You make me feel, like I've never felt  
Kisses so good I've got to holler for help  
  
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to hold me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
  
Every day you find something new  
To pull out your bag and fine perfume  
You got me trying to do new things, too  
Just so I could keep up with you  
  
Thank you baby  
  
You didn't have to shake it like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to make it like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
  
All my life I've been short changed  
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame  
Now I know what the girls were talking about  
When they say that you  
  
Ooh, I wanna thank you, baby  
Thank you, honey  
I've got to thank you, oh  
Baby, hey yeah


I met you on a midaway at a fair last year  
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear  
You were playing on the horses  
You were playing on the guitar strings  
  
You were playing like the devil wearing wings  
Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings  
Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing  
Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?  
  
Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky  
I followed through a sideshow to another town  
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds  
You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice  
  
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice  
Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice  
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price  
Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in  
  
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?  
Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news  
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues  
The man calls out the numbers...he sometimes mentions mine  
  
But I feel like I've been working overtime  
Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime  
And I envy you the valley that you've found  
'Cause I'm midway down the midway  
  
Slowin' down


All the ways I cared for you  
Are working like you want them to  
As I break down and you stay strong  
I write my own forgiveness song  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But it's not your concern  
Another night and it's only right  
I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
The wine dark room the flashing eyes  
That hung me from my string of lies  
You said you were numb from wondering  
I guess I wasn't listening  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But you're not concerned  
Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
With my own hands  
I fashioned this frame  
And into the wood  
I carved out my name  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But you're not concerned  
Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
And it's only right  
That I toss and I turn  
In the bed I made  
  
The bed I made  
The bed I made


If he walks by and the women get engrosed  
If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast  
He's got a lot of what they call the most  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze  
Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it  
  
If he mesmerizes each and every one  
And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done  
He even makes my grandma feel like she's twenty one  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if I got to go down to him on bended knees  
It's because I'm hoping, obviously  
That some day his answer will be  
The boy can't help it  
He's in love with me.


Let's run baby through these city streets  
We're all victims of captivity  
Let's stop the madness without any tricks  
I'll whisper bible quotes and you can read my lips  
  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
Let's get back to the elements of style  
Let's get back to where it all began  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
  
Let's dance barefoot over broken glass  
Slither like a snake does through the wet cold grass  
Howl and tremble in a sleepless grind  
Let's do the brain drain and leave it all behind  
  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
Let's get back to the elements of style  
Let's get back to where it all began  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
  
You can sit in your room and worry  
You can contemplate the end  
Or let your house burn down behind you  
Run with me through the streets again  
  
Let's get back, I wanna go back  
Let's get back, let's get back  
  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
Let's get back to the elements of style  
Let's get back to where it all began  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
  
You can hide out on your rooftop  
Wishing you had never been  
Or go down to Hal's Bar and Grill  
And find your innocence again  
  
Let's get back, let's get back  
Let's get back, I wanna go back  
I've got to go back


I need a drink  
Don't want to think  
I drink too much  
But who's to say  
What's right or wrong?  
  
I guess you think you see  
You're tellin' me  
That I don't know  
When it's passed the point  
Of feelin' good  
I run around and find  
I just can't get satisfied  
Tonight  
  
Now there's a phone  
I hear the sound  
I needed to talk  
But it's too late  
For talkin' now  
  
I guess I'll go alone  
I feel a glow  
Here I am  
Here I am  
Here I am  
What I need is a friend tonight  
What I need is a friend  
What I need is someone  
What I really deed is just one more drink  
Tonight  
Tonight


In the early rush of morning  
Trying to get the kids to school  
One's hanging on my shirttail  
Another's locked up  
In her room  
And I'm yelling up the stairs  
Stop worrying 'bout your hair  
You look fine  
  
Then they're fightin' in the backseat  
I'm playing referee  
Now someone's gotta go  
The moment that we leave  
And everybody's late  
I swear that I can't wait  
'Till they grow up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Then they do  
And that's how it is  
It's just quiet in the morning  
Can't believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do  
  
Now the youngest is starting college  
She'll be leavin' in the Fall  
And Brianna's latest boyfriend  
Called to ask if we could talk  
And I got the impression  
That he's about to pop the question any day  
  
I look over at their pictures  
Sittin' in their frames  
I see them as babies  
I guess that'll never change  
You pray all their lives  
That someday they will find happiness  
  
[Chorus:]  
Then they do  
And that's how it is  
It's just quiet in the morning  
Can't believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do  
  
No more Monday pta's  
No carpools  
Or soccer games  
Your work is done  
Now you've got time  
That's all your own  
You've been waitin' for so long  
For those days to come  
  
[Chorus:]  
Then they do  
And that's how it is  
It's just quiet in the morning  
Can't believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do


Don't have to humble yourself to me,  
I ain't your judge or your king  
Baby, you know I ain't no Queen of Sheba  
We may not even have our dignity,  
This could be just a powerful thing  
Baby we can choose you know we ain't no amoeba  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Don't come from me and you,  
It comes from up above  
I ain't no porcupine,  
Take off your kid gloves  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
  
I ain't some icon carved out of soap  
Sent here to clean up your reputation  
Baby, you know you ain't no Prince Charming  
We can live in fear or act out of hope  
For some kind of peaceful situation  
Baby, how come the cry of love is so alarming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ugly ducklings don't turn into swans  
And glide off down the lake  
Whether your sunglasses are off or on  
You only see the world you make  
  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Don't come from me and you,  
It comes from up above  
I ain't no porcupine,  
Take off your kid gloves  
  
Are you ready for it  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Don't come from me and you,  
It comes from up above  
I ain't no porcupine,  
Take off your kid gloves  
  
Are you ready for it  
Are you ready for love, baby  
Oh yeah babe  
Are you ready for love


I wonder how many teardrops gonna fall tonight?  
I wonder how many heartaches gonna a woman have in one life?  
  
I lost a lover, lost my friend  
I'm through with love, I just can't win  
  
I'm a three time loser, three time loser  
  
I wonder how many hours for true love I will have to wait  
I wonder how many heartaches for true love I will have to wait  
  
Lost love once, lost love twice  
What kind of love is worth that price  
  
Three time loser  
One two three into into three  
A three time loser  
  
I wonder how many hours for true love I will have to wait  
I wonder how many heartaches for true love I will have to wait  
  
I lost a lover, lost my friend  
I'm through with love and I just can't win  
  
Three time loser babe  
One two three into into three  
Three time loser  
  
Lost love once, lost it twice  
What kind of love is worth that price  
  
Three time loser babe, see I'm three time loser babe


Bonnie Raitt-Trinkets  
(Emory Joseph)  
When I was a kid  
I had a little record  
I played it over and over  
Each and every day.  
Sung by a man  
Named Louie Armstrong.  
Saint's marched right in from my Close and Play.  
When I was a kid  
I had a little picture  
And I looked at that picture  
All the time.  
Painted by a man  
Mama said his name was Vinnie.  
A farmer sowing seeds on a really nice day.  
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies like  
To help 'em be happy  
Like that guy named Mike.  
Yeah that groovy old man that fixes my bike  
Down there on 'Dumaine Street, New Orleans Louisiana.  
When I was a kid  
I had a little wiener dog  
I loved that little wiener dog  
And she loved me.  
Spent warm spring days feeding that little wiener dog  
Ripe sweet cherries from our cherry tree.  
(An') if I ever get older, if I ever die.  
If I get to a gate at the end of the sky.  
And a beautiful creature says  
Now Bonnie what do you want?  
Might say a record and a picture and a wiener dog swear to God.  
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies want  
To help 'em be happy  
Like that ol' gal named Betty.  
Yeah that groovy old chick teaches Tai-Chi on the levee.  
Rain or shine she's out there she's dedicated.  
She wrinkled but she  
Lovely.  
She flexible and don't you wish we all were flexible enough to  
Dance now?  
Dance little children now  
The whole round world is your neighborhood.  
Dance little children now  
Nekkid as a Jaybird.  
Dance little children now  
The whole round world is your neighborhood.  
Dance little children now  
Nekkid as a Jaybird.  
They're just trinkets.  
Little stepping stones  
To let you know you was here.  


Maybe I'm a dreamer  
Maybe just a fool  
Lately I can hardly see the sun  
If you had a secret I could take a guess  
Nothin' in your eyes seems to hold me  
Truth or consequences  
Which one will it be  
  
Someone said that time would ease the pain  
Of two lives love has torn apart  
But, I believe whoever wrote that song,  
Never had a broken heart  
  
One of us is hiding  
One of us can tell  
Cause no one likes to be the first to know  
Someone has to answer  
Cause someone has to ask  
Keeping on like this is torture  
And going undecided is twice as bad for sure  
  
Someone said that time would ease the pain  
Of two lives love has torn apart  
But, I believe whoever wrote that song  
Never had a broken heart


Ah, don't let me grow bitter I pray  
Give me strength to carry on my way  
  
I'm leanin' on you like a wooden cane  
Well, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
  
I'm believin' there's a reason for this trial'  
This too shall pass in a little while  
Whoa, Lord have mercy if I complain  
I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
Yes, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
  
Paint me in a river of my tears  
Whisper hope and truth, courage in my ears  
  
Well, when I'm hurtin' I have a dangerous tongue  
I lose it and use it like a gun  
Oh wont you stop me if you see me takin' aim  
I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
If I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
Yes, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
  
Paint me in a river of my tears  
Whisper hope and truth, courage in my ears  
Remind me when I reach the other side  
I'll b thankful for every tear that I cries  
  
Don't let the darkness drive me insane  
I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
If I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain  
Yes, I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through the valley of the pain


Mary Mac, dressed in black  
Silver buttons up and down her back  
How low tips her toe?  
She broke the needle and she can't sew  
  
Walkin' that dog  
Just a walkin' the dog  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Now, listen here  
I asked my mama for fifteen cents  
See that elephant, now, jump the fence  
He jumped so high, he touched the sky  
And never got back till the fourth of July  
  
Walkin' the dog  
Just walkin' the dog  
But if you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk that dog  
Walk it now, walk it, baby  
  
Mary, Mary, quite contrary  
Tell me, baby, how does your garden grow?  
You got silver bells and cockleshells  
[Incomprehensible] maids in a row  
  
A walkin' the dog  
Just a walkin' the dog  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Hey, hey, hey, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
Walkin', a walkin'  
A hey, hey, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
Walkin', a walkin'  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Hey, hey, hey, turn it up, turn it  
Just walkin', a walkin'  
Hey, hey, can't you see  
Just walkin'  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Hey, hey, hey, come on, baby  
Hey, hey, hey, just a walkin', walkin the dog  
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby, just walkin' the dog  
Hey, hey, hey  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
That leash, baby, bring it over here


As simple as breathing, I picture your face  
All tangled in daydreams and shielded with grace  
I feel you beside me again  
Wherever you may be, lift up your head for me  
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you  
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out  
Across the wilderness from me to you  
As certain as sunrise, your image unwinds  
You're clearer than crystal, you fill up my mind  
Now, I have you by my side  
Wherever you may be, lift up your head for me  
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you  
Though continents divide and lonely thoughts collide  
Our Heaven will allow, no distance now  
I can always close my eyes  
Take your absence by surprise  
Hold my breath and make believe  
As simple as breathing, I picture your face  
All tangled in daydreams and shielded with grace  
There's somewhere in my heart only for you  
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
Wherever you may be  
(Wherever you may be)  
Lift up your head for me  
(Lift up your head)  
There's somewhere in my heart only for you  
(Somewhere in my heart)  
If I must do without  
(If I must do without)  
I'll let these sparks fly out  
(Ooh, baby)  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
(Across this wilderness from me to you)  
Wherever you may be  
Lift up your head for me  
There's somewhere in my heart only for you  
(I'm missing you baby)  
If I must do without  
I'll let these sparks fly out  


Nobody else can make me happy  
No one could hurt me like you do  
You were the only one that mattered  
Then you were gone  
Love had moved on  
Left me alone  
  
Thinking of you  
There was never any other  
you and I were created to dream  
  
Isn't it love that keeps us breathing  
Isn't it love we're sent here for  
Wasn't that love we were feeling  
Deep in our soul  
Deeper than we know  
Keepin' me whole  
There was never any question  
You are forever in my mind  
You and me were meant to be together  
  
I might as well have been dyin'  
When we were apart  
When you came back  
I felt the beating of my heart  
  
You and I there was never any question  
You will forever hold my heart  
You and me were meant to be together  
  
You  
It was always you


You got to be ready  
You got to be ready, yeah  
  
This woman don't like no nonsense  
I like lovin' every day  
And I don't like to find no evidence, no  
To prove you're giving my love away  
What more can I say  
  
Except you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine (ready baby)  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
  
This woman don't do no hand pickin'  
And I don't think one look is a felony  
And I don't appreciate no rubber neckin', no  
'Bout a man, when he's with me  
Out in the street  
  
Except you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)  
I said you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
  
Ready for love  
Ready for love  
Got to be ready for love  
  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready, yeah  
  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)  
  
Can't be a cold lover  
Just like my old lover  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to get ready  
You got to stay ready  
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)


I don't have to beg you to hold me  
Cause somebody else will  
You don't have to love me when I want it, no  
Cause somebody else will  
  
Your so called friends say you don't need it  
When all the time they're trying to get it  
Look out  
Your good thing is about to come to an end  
Your real good thing is about to come to an end  
  
All those nights I watched the four walls  
I did not have to watch them all alone  
When other men said they wanted me (whenever someone said)  
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own (think that I was)  
  
You have all the love that I've got baby  
Even ice melts to water and gets hot  
Look out  
Your good  
  
Gettin' myself back together  
Is going to be a big problem I know  
But when the right man says he wants me  
You can bet I won't tell him no  
  
Cause your real good


Chorus  
It's all because of you  
Yeah you  
It's all because of you  
Nobody else makes me feel like you do  
I have the time of my life  
And it's all because of you  
If I was able to thank you  
For coming into my life  
If I was able to tell the whole world how I feel  
My love is for real  
If I was able to write a song  
I would have filled it with love  
If I was able to open my heart you would see  
I'm so happy  
Chorus  
If I was able to live my life (over again)  
I'd share the minutes with you  
If I was able to count the times you bring out the sun  
When I'm feeling down  
If I was able to explain  
How you have opened my eyes  
I sure have tried about thousand times  
I just feel so alive  
Chorus (2x)  
I found the meaning  
I cherish my life  
Now I see everything in colors so bright  
And when it's raining  
I still feel the sun  
So take a good look  
I'm walking clouds  
Chorus  


I do believe in fate cause that's how we met  
It was raining and we were soaking wet  
You took the last of cabs on an empty street  
Then you smiled at me and said 'take a seat... '  
  
I said do you believe in love at first sight?  
You said if you give me a reason I might  
Ok, well your hair is wet and your clothes are a mess  
And your makeup is all over your face...  
And still you're so...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Beautiful, so, sweet and just adorable  
You are a miracle, simply irresistible  
You are so beautiful, so, sweet and just adorable  
You are the finest thing that I've seen in my life  
You're everything that I've ever dreamed of  
  
Now it's been seven years 1 month and a day  
Since we met and I'm so happy to say  
Today we'll be man and wife and dedicate  
Our lives to the precious thing we have called love  
  
So now I'm standing here well dressed and prepared  
In a black suit that you told me to wear  
And when you're walking in, you amazing thing,  
You take my breath away...  
Cause you are so.....  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
For richer and poorer till death do us part  
In sickness, in health you are always in my heart  
Till the day when we're old and grey  
I will cherish and love you in every kind of way  
Cause you are so....  
  
[Chorus:]


Life is like a hurricane, here in Duck Burg  
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a duck blur  
Might solve a mystery, or rewrite history!  
  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
Everyday they're out there making,  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
Tales of daring-do bad and good  
Luck Tales (woo oo)  
  
When it's seems they're headed for the final curtain  
Bold deduction never fails, that's for certain  
The worst of messes become successes!  
  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
Everyday they're out there making,  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
Tales of daring-do bad and good  
Luck Tales (woo oo)  
  
D-D-Danger lurks behind you  
There's a stranger out to find you  
What to do? Just grab on to some  
  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
Everyday they're out there making,  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
Tales of daring-do bad and good  
Duck Tales (woo oo)  
  
Not pony tails or cotton tails  
No, Duck Tales (woo oo)


You make me live  
I wanna say  
Efharisto  
  
I wanna write you a song,  
So you'll understand  
All that you see in my  
Eyes and read in my hand  
Is what I honestly feel  
This time I know that it's for real  
And 'til I find the right way  
This is what I wanna say  
  
Efharisto  
For all the love you give  
And the way you make me live  
I'll say the only word, I know  
Efharisto  
I thank the stars above  
For this everlasting love  
I wanna say  
Efharisto  
  
You are to me like the sun  
So warm in the sky  
You are like sweet summer rain  
As soft as a sigh  
  
You're like the ocean so deep  
Rocking me gently in my sleep  
Don't know where I'm gonna start  
So I just say it from the heart  
  
Efharisto  
For all the love you give  
And the way you make me live  
I'll say the only word, I know  
Efharisto  
I thank the stars above  
For this everlasting love  
I say it from my heart  
For your love  
  
Efharisto  
For all the love you give  
And the way you make me live  
I'll say the only word, I know  
Efharisto  
I thank the stars above  
For this everlasting love  
I wanna say Efharisto  
  
Efharisto  
Efharisto


My doctor says I need no cure this  
Time That everything's alright and I  
Am fine but my friends don't agree  
They say I'm not the one I used to  
Be And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder Why I'm smiling all the time  
The only thing I have inside my mind  
Is a picture of you And it's there no  
Matter what I do No matter what I  
Do not know...  
  
I don't know what it is but I think I'm  
Falling in love I don't know what it is  
But when I close my eyes You're the  
One I'm dreaming of I don't know  
What it is but I'm floating in the sky  
I don't know what it is and I sure  
Don't know how But you filled  
My heart with butterflies I'm falling in  
Love...  
  
Seems like all my problems went  
Away I start to make the most of  
Everyday So I spend them with you  
No one makes me feel the way you  
Do And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder about the pain I get inside  
Everytime you're not by my side  
You have opened a door  
I have never felt this way before  
And I want more I don't know....  
  
I don't know what it is....  
  
When we are walking I get to hold  
Your hand And that is making me  
Proud, I'm screaming out loud  
I, I am a happy man  
  
And when we are looking up on a  
Clear blue shy You give me a kiss, I  
Wonder who is THIS LUCKY GUY...


Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh  
'Cause I found real love  
Yeah  
  
Going alright  
Sithink that its time for  
Making it right

On certain Sundays in November,  
When the whether bothers me,  
I empty draws of other summers,  
Where my shadows used to be,  
She is standing by the water,  
As her smile begins to curl,  
In this or any other summer,  
She is something all together different,  
Never just an ordanairy girl.  
And in the evenings on Long Island,  
When the colours start to fade,  
She wears a silly yellow hat,  
That someone gave her when she stayed,  
I didn't think that she returned it,  
We left New York in a whirl,  
Time expands and then contracts,  
When you are spinning in the grips of someone,  
Who is not an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep, you find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning covers you with light,  
And it makes you feel alright,  
But its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
You send your lover off to China,  
Then you awit for her to call,  
You put your girl upon a pedestal,  
And you wait fro her to fall,  
I put my summers back in a letter,  
And I hide it from the world,  
All the regrets you can't forget,  
Are somehow pressed upon the picture,  
In the face of such an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep,  
You find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in thee dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning showers you with light,  
But its just the same hard candy, your remembering again,  
Again, again, again, again.  
And its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
  
Go ask her to come around,  
And see me late, after dark,  
Don't ask me to go around,  
And wait to see if theres a spark X2


There's a hole where my heart should be  
And baby only you can fill this emptiness in me  
There's a hole where my heart should be  
So baby wrap it up, pack it up  
Bring your lovin' back to me  
Chorus  
Everytime that we're apart  
I close my eyes and I  
I can't help think of you  
But girl unless you're in my arms  
It's just not feeling right  
The telephone won't do  
The space is killing me  
It just won't let me be  
And just the thought of you girl  
Can make me weak  
I feel so incomplete  
I'm looking at your photograph  
I dream I'm holding you  
I dream I'm kissing you  
But girl your picture never kisses back  
It's just not good enough  
I need your human touch  
Everyone can see  
What's missing here with me  
And just the thought of you girl  
Can make me weak  
I feel so incomplete  
Chorus (2x)  
Girl I'm a million miles from heaven  
Cause heaven is wherever you are  
I need you to feel alive again oh  


You say of love  
There's no such thing  
You've only known  
The pain it brings  
  
You question why  
I give your heart  
You stay alone  
You stay apart  
  
I've seen  
I know  
I trust  
I feel  
Love is alive and for real  
  
And I believe  
I believe in love  
I believe two hearts  
Can learn to beat as one  
  
And I believe  
I believe that time  
Can tie your soul to mine  
I see the doubt there in your eyes  
But I believe (in love)  
  
I know you're scared  
I understand  
Please take my word  
And take my hand  
  
If there's no faith  
Inside of you  
I can believe  
Enough for two  
  
I've seen  
I know  
I feel  
I trust  
Love has a future for us  
  
I believe I believe in love  
Two hearts can beat as one  
I believe I believe that time  
Can tie your soul to mine


(I feel love)  
  
I couldn't believe, it happened to me  
You knocked me away  
So close to my heart, don't know who you are  
So sudden but maybe too far  
How could I believe it  
Finding us here where we are  
I still don't know who you are  
  
I can feel love, I can feel love in your eyes  
I'm finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesn't matter whatever you're saying  
In everything you show me I feel love  
  
So much I have seen, so far I have been  
But never so close  
So deep in my soul, so much I've been told  
That love is a heartbreaking game  
How can I believe it  
Finding us here where we are  
I've never been so far  
  
I can feel love.I can feel love in your eyes  
I'm finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesn't matter whatever you're saying  
In everything you show me I feel love  
  
And I know deep in my heart  
Nothing could ever bring me down  
When you feel love, you know who you are  
It's moving you on and on  
  
I can feel love.I can feel love in your eyes  
I'm finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesn't matter whatever you're saying  
In everything you show me I feel love


Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Going down to the water, some time alone  
Some time for my heart and soul  
When I think of the moment, you shed a tear  
And said I deserve much more  
You must try to put some faith in yourself  
I swear to God you are the best a man can get  
Now and forever  
Chorus:  
I love you, I love you, I love you and I'll show you that it's true  
I'm crazy about you  
I love you, I love you, I love you and you know that it's true  
I'm crazy about you  
Baby I love you  
We can find a solution, I know it's hard  
You have to go back in time  
But when you trust your emotions, then let me in  
I'll give you this heart of mine  
You must try to put some faith in yourself  
I swear to God you are the best a man can get  
Now and forever  
Chorus  
When you wake up in the morning, I love you  
When you come home in the evening, I want you  
When you are angry and shouting, I need you  
When I find you with another, I love you  
Chorus  


Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson, deeno  
I'm sitting in a place where the sun is shining  
Looking up where the birds are flying  
Not afraid as the sea is running high  
'cause I know you are right by my side  
Holding me when I'm feeling so small  
Saving me when I'm starting to fall  
I'm about to fall, but your standing tall  
The memories of you is a loving mother  
Making sure we would stay together  
Sometimes you're the bigger sister too  
When we needed someone to talk to  
Always there with your arms open wide  
I know it's best but I can't stop wonder  
Why it had to end this way  
Grandmother she leaves today  
Chorus:  
It's over now  
There's a song that they sing in a big bright city  
Yes it's over now  
There's a song and it's song by a choir of angels  
Saving you from all your pain  
To heaven beautiful heaven  
Singing for you....  
It's been some time since you got the message  
You've been brave, you've been strong all through this  
When they said there was nothing they could do  
You took care of the ones around you  
Never felt sorry for yourself  
All you wanted was to live a little longer time  
You said to me but God is kind to you you see  
Chorus  
And on and on the angels sing  
And on and on the choir sing for you, beautfiful you  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on we all will be together  
Sooner or later  
Together with you...  
I miss the times when I stopped by  
I still remember our last goodbye  
You were standing in the door waiting for me  
Like thousand times before  
Chorus  
I miss the times  
I miss the times with you  
And this one's for you  
And this one's for you  


Your love has got the power,  
Your love has got the power  
And I thank you (2x)  
I spend my nights alone with the memories that I have  
I try to figure it out how things can happen like that  
I will never forget all the good times that we had  
I'm trying to go on with my life throughout the day  
I believe that you would have been wanting me to stay  
If I just could have shown how I feel deep inside  
chorus:  
Your love has got the power,  
Your love has got the power and I thank you  
Your love has got the power,  
Your love has got the power and I thank you  
Your love has got the power,  
'cause your love has got the power baby  
Your love has got the power,  
'cause your love has got the power baby  
sometimes it's hard to achieve all the goes that you have  
You only know what your feelings like when she's no longer there  
Everything's got a reason and it's time to be fair  
I wanna thank you for dealing with me the way you did  
You've got me understanding some things are meant to be  
A lesson in love isn't all that I see  
chorus  
your love yeah, your love yeah, give it all up for your love (2x)  
I'm dreaming we're together the way it should be  
The world is open wide yet your holding on to me yeah  
I'm giving up my life and the feeling is here to stay  
chorus  


Someone found me a letter you wrote me on the radio  
And they told the world just how you felt  
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat  
They never said your name but i know just who they meant  
  
Woa woa  
I was so surprised and shocked and wondered too  
If by chance you heard it for yourself?  
I never told a soul just how i've been feeling over you  
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
[Chorus]  
On the radio oh oh oh  
On the radio oh oh oh...now now  
  
Don't it kind of strike you sad when you hear our song  
Things are not the same since we broke up last june  
The only thing that i want to hear is it that you love me still  
And that you think, you'll be coming home real soon  
  
Woho yeah it kinda' made me feel proud when i heard him say  
You couldn't find the words to say yourself  
And now in my heart i know i can say what i really feel  
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you think that love isn't found on on the radio  
Then tune right in you may find the love you lost  
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the girl i sent away long ago  
She finally realized he said it really loud on the radio  
  
[Chorus]


I've made up my mind I've packed my bags  
I'm not returning home, until someone will give me reason to  
I lock the door and take a breath  
I'm ready to let go, I know you're somewhere out there too  
There's only one thing for me to do and I go  
  
[Chorus]  
Over the mountains and over the sea  
To find a heart that belongs to me  
Anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere 'til I find you  
I run through the valleys  
I run through the fields  
I'd do anything I am hard to please  
And anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere 'til I find you  
  
I fly like the wind, I don't know where my heart will lead the way  
I need someone to love and hold on to  
But the road is long I've had my doubts  
But nothing lets me down cause  
I know you're somewhere out there too waiting for me to get to you and I go...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It doesn't matter what  
The time will tell  
'Cause I will be here waiting  
For you, for you and me  
It doesn't matter what the others say  
Cause I will keep on searching  
And I go and I go and I go and I go  
  
[Chorus: x2]


He's a kid, with a dream  
But he's different from the average teens  
Upper class, respected family, fancy house,  
They've got the money  
But his life is not as fun as it seems  
  
Daddys boy, goes to school, doing well  
He's got the best grades too, as a doctor,  
Or a lawyer professor,  
Or a teacher he has to make his parents dream come true  
  
But he wants to be a Rockstar, oh oh  
With long curly hair he is bangin' his head Rockstar, oh oh  
The girls are getting wild they try to get him into bed  
He's a Rockstar, oh oh  
The crowd is getting crazy  
They are screaming his name Rockstar, oh oh  
Leaving the show with an mtv-host called Elaine  
  
Every day, after school he found a way to earn a buck or two  
When he'd saved, just every penny in a jar, that he was hiding  
He went out and bought his first guitar  
  
Brought it home,  
Sneaked inside, locked the door to his own room to hide, picked it up,  
It was a Gibson plugged it in, and turned the amp on  
It was time to make his dream come alive  
  
He's gonna be a Rockstar oh oh  
Posing for his fans covered with chewinggum tatoos  
Like a Rockstar oh oh  
Always takes his limo to his giant swimming pool  
Rockstar oh oh  
Taking photos for the cover of  
Billboad magazine A Rockstar oh oh  
With a tightest black leatherpants  
And the biggest mouth you've seen....  
  
But when his daddy came home he took his guitar away,  
Music is out of the question and it's starting from today  
I don't care if you say you want to catch the moon  
You're gonna get an education or you're be on your own  
  
Well I don't want your money and  
I don't need your advise I will sleep on the street and  
I'll just roll the dize  
Living day by day like the real rockers do,  
Practice for my break, that is what I'm gonna do!  
So give me my guitar back...  
  
I'm gonna be a Rockstar, oh oh  
Strawberry champagne, I'm having breakfast in my bed  
Rockstar, oh oh  
I refuse to walk a carpet as long as it's not red  
I'm a Rockstar I tried to land my jetplane down on  
Sunset boulevard Rockstar oh oh  
The police wanted me arrested I said 'Put it on my card....


She's pristine, intellectual and verbal  
Every dad's living dream  
Upper class behaviour is in her genes  
  
She is smart she's manipulative and gorgeous  
At prom she was crowned as a queen  
But she never takes you behind the scenes...  
  
She's like a  
Sin - Cinderella  
Choked by the world she's in  
Sin - Cinderella  
Surving on vitamins  
Sin - Cinderella  
An angel throughout the day  
But in the nighttime  
Her glory just flies away  
  
She is cool, a sophisticated actress  
Playing herself on the screen  
Though her smile is sweet her thoughts are obscene  
  
Pure as white, goes to bed thought it's still early  
Kisses her father goodnight  
Then she's turning on her working light...  
  
She's like a...  
  
In the night, if you spot a blue light window  
It could be a new tv-set.  
Or is someone making friends on the net... ?  
  
She's a like...


Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson, lira, gustafsson  
Everybody need something to believe in  
Everybody need something to put their trust in x2  
Some with luck, put their faith in love  
Some show off and let the money talk  
Some look up, read the stars above  
Some believe in making dead man walk  
Another year and another week, another day  
Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2  
Chorus:  
Everybody need something to believe in  
Everybody need something to put their trust in x2  
Free...believe in what you want  
Free...believe in what you want  
Some might say it's a miracle  
Some might call it the destiny  
Some let god, lead them all the way  
Some would say they believe in me  
Another year and another week, another day  
Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2  
Chorus  


It's hard to say goodbye, it hurts to be alone  
And all that is left is a memory to love and keep as a part on me , that's

all for you and I know you'll do the same and I hard it all me seem you are
always in my dream.  
And We will meet again far me on the stormy weathers for the on the cloud is
sky. Sweet we will meet again, when we do we were last forever, when we do we
were stayin'together you and me  
We we'll mean to be ohoh a perfect harmonie and every day will close by as

weathers for the on the cloud is sky. Sweet we will meet again, when we do we

You and me  


In the morning  
When you wake up to a brand new day  
With a feeling  
Everything is gonna go your day  
And you open up the window  
And the air is just seeting with life...  
  
What a day, when the sun is shinning through  
It's shinning for you  
What a day, when the birds are singing too  
They're singing for you  
What a day, oh oh  
What a day, oh oh  
What a day, oh oh  
What a day...  
  
Having breakfast  
In a garden full of blooming trees  
It's so quiet  
You can hear the sound of falling leaves  
Though you close your eyes for a moment  
Light is all that you see...  
  
What a day...  
  
You've been searching  
You've been climbing never give up  
Just to realise  
You've been standing on the mountain top  
Cause the future's gone tomorrow  
But your life is right here today...  
  
What a day...  
  
The future's gone tomorrow  
Life is here today  
Things' gonna go your way  
This is yor day  
The future's gone tomorrow  
Life is here today... [x2]


You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me.  
Baby don't you know  
That all I wanted was to be by your side  
To find a way to the light through the dark.  
You saw the man that I was deep inside... ah huh...  
There's a voice,  
That was screamin' inside of my head  
But I was quiet and peaceful instead.  
Yes I have learnt from the things that you said... ah huh...  
[Chorus]  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes,  
You showed me someone that no one else can see.  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun.  
You make me believe I am someone.  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me.  
I was lost,  
I was scared I was losing my mind.  
Running away from myself all the time,  
Coz there was something I was waiting to find... ah huh...  
There you were, coz God has sent me an angel from above.  
You gave me strength, and you showed me how to love,  
For that, I'm thankful for the rest of my life... ah huh...  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes,  
You showed me someone that no one else can see.  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun,  
You make me believe I am someone.  
You opened my eyes,  
To a whole new world for me.  
Now you're gone  
And though it hurts to know you're with someone new,  
You know I always wanted the best for you.  
You deserve to get the best in life too,  
I'm grateful for the time with you...  
Oooh...  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes  
You showed me someone that no one else can see.  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun,  
You make me believe I am someone.  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me.  
You opened my eyes...  
You opened my eyes...  
You opened my eyes...  
You opened my eyes...  
  


Ann a-sleepin' on my bed  
Hair a-tumblin'' round your head  
You will always be apart of me  
When I look in your eyes... It's my reflection I see  
  
Ann I wonder how you knew  
I needed someone just like you  
Were you on a beam of guiding light  
That came in my life... Late that september night.  
  
And though I try to hold back the years  
I cannot hold the dawn  
And so I try to hold back the tears  
When love has grown up and gone...  
  
Ann I'll love you 'till I die  
And when you hear this lullabye  
I'll be with you though we're far apart  
And you'll be with me... Right here inside my heart.


Take me anyway you want me  
Cause I need your love to see me through  
You can make me anyway you want me  
That's all that I can offer you  
I have tried so hard to please you  
But I just can't seem to reach you  
  
Tried, tried a little kindness  
Every night and day like I knew I should  
But you can take me, yes and you can leave me  
But I always stayed, and you knew I would  
Come on, come on closer now  
I will get to you somehow  
  
Come on, come on closer now  
I will get to you somehow  
But you got to show me how  
Please, please baby, please  
Please, baby show me the way to your heart  
  
You got to take me anyway you want me  
Or take me just, just the way I am  
Take me, or you can make me


Baby, I'm-a want you  
Baby, I'm-a need you  
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about  
Maybe I'm-a crazy  
But I just can't live without...  
  
Your lovin' and affection  
Givin' me direction  
Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour  
Lately I'm a-prayin'  
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me  
  
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by  
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why...  
  
Lately I'm a-prayin'  
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.  
  
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by  
Then you came along and made me laugh  
And made me cry...  
You taught me why...  
  
Baby, I'm-a want you  
Baby, I'm-a need you  
  
Oh, it took so long to find you, baby  
Baby, I'm-a want you  
Baby, I'm-a need you


Be kind to me  
Be kind to me  
Be kind to me  
Oh baby and I'll show you the way  
  
Kindness is a virtue  
Come on now babe  
It won't hurt you to be  
A victim of kindness  
No more hesitations  
We don't need no  
Explanations this time  
We'll leave them behind us  
  
While you play the martyr  
You know you just  
make it harder for us  
To love one another  
So much indecision  
That don't mean you  
Got religion I think  
You're gonna discover  
  
Be kind to me


Always look so good on the outside  
When you get to believin' it's true,  
Then you know that you're on your way  
People tug on your shirt, say you're lucky  
You've got ev'rything you want, but you don't  
Yet you dare not say  
Go downtown people runnin' around  
They climb slowly draggin' you downtown,  
Horns make a dent in your mind  
Plush rooms make a blindin' your eye to see,  
Blindin' me. Light, lovely light,  
Won't ya' shine in my window  
Love, precious love won't ya' fill ev'ry room,  
Been too long on the road.  
Maybe cynics veins are my life blood  
Maybe bitin' the hand that I feed so I'll try  
Try to understand what it is that devours your freedom,  
Makes you drop what you used to hold in your heart.  
All the things you planned  
Go upstairs with a someone who says she cares,  
Like the devil she does,  
What comes ever into your mind?  
Then gone, leavin' you with the coldest room,  
Oldest gloom. Warm, won't you be,  
Please be there in my winter.  
Love, precious love won't ya' come full circle,  
Been too long on the road.  
How can I do this to myself?  
Have I taken leave of my senses?  
What kind of changes make a man  
Want to tear down all his fences  
Whoa, I'd like to know. Home ever home,  
How could I ever doubt you  
Love, precious love, how could I live without you?  
Been too long on the road.


I'd like to take you home girl, and make you mine.  
I'd get you all alone girl, and take my time.  
Think how you feel in your heart when you climb to the top of,  
Of a big roller coaster ride.  
  
You're gettin' high on desire worth waitin'  
On the other side.  
I'd like to treat you nice girl, and treat you mean.  
I'd get you on your own girl, and fill your dreams.  
  
Think how you feel in your heart when you get to the fall,  
Of a big roller coaster ride.  
That's how it is and the way that it would be  
If you come with me.  
  
Blue satin pillow,  
Black satin silhou-  
Ette on the window  
Shade of the night.  
  
Soft light a glowin'  
Sweet night a goin'  
Out like the candle's  
Flickerin' light  
  
You know by now its your love that I'm after  
And I don' want no alibi.  
There's just no need to take no for an answer,  
Yes is in your eyes.  
  
I'd like to take you home girl, and make you mine.  
I'd get you all alone girl, and take my time.  
I'd like to treat you nice girl, and treat you mean.


Dismal Day  
  
I look into my morning mirror  
And it reveals some things to me that I had not been able to see  
I saw someone that I'm not sure I want to be  
An empty lonely face was starin' back at me  
  
All and all, I would have to say  
It's been a rather dismal day  
  
The afternoon was slow in coming  
I drug myself  outside the people that I knew would be there  
And though they walked along pretending not to care  
I knew behind my back they'd point and laugh and stare  
  
CHORUS  
  
And now the evening shadow's falling  
I guess it's best I lay my hopes to rest for no one's calling my name  
I sit and wait behind a door that's never knocked on  
I live in silence like my phone that's never talked on  
  
CHORUS


Everytime I look into you it tears me up inside  
Got a hunger for ya, woman, that just can't be denied  
Don't tell me no, ain't my kind of answer  
Don't tell me no, won't accept that answer  
Makin' lots of money, honey, ain't what I call success  
And I won't have what I need until you tell me yes  
Don't tell me no - ain't my kind of answer  
Don't tell me no - ain't no kind of answer  
That's how much I want you  
Like a good brew, like a fine wine  
You improve with time and I want you, I love you  
That's how much I need ya  
You're a part of me, my philosophy, my reality  
And I want you, that's how much I love you  
Realize alibis ain't too wise  
And they just won't cut this time  
You're gonna give this boy a chance  
'Cause he's apt to blow your mind  
Don't tell me no, ain't my kind of answer  
Don't tell me no, won't accept that answer  


I told you before, don't you hear what I say  
I won't take it no more, no more making me stay  
Down on my knees, you know I'm down on my knees yea  
Yes I've been down on my knees  
But I'm through begging please  
I won't get back on my knees.  
  
Nobody knows, what your putting me through  
Nobody knows, if it's worth it for you  
Nobody sees, you got me down on my knees  
Well I've been down on my knees  
And I'm through begging please  
Don't put me back on my knees.  
  
You know how I always loved you  
Never placed myself above you,  
  
Don't let me go, if I wish that I could  
Don't tell me no, if I wish that you would  
Down on my knees, you know I'm down on my knees  
Well I've been down on my knees  
But I'm through begging please  
Don't put me back on my knees.


I see her walking in the velvet moonlight  
But then she hides behind the clock of midnight  
And as I look to see her face  
She disappears without a trace  
  
Sometimes I find myself in endless wandering  
When I awaken in the misty morning  
And I must look to find my way  
As I await the end of day.  
Dream Lady  
Dream Lady  
  
And I await the end of day  
'Til nighttime comes again to stay  
Dream lady  
Dream Lady  
Dream Lady


Went to my family doctor  
For a pain inside my head  
Told him that since you left me  
I was feelin' like just about dead  
Doctor, what can you give me  
And should I take one or two  
Can you tell me just what it's gonna do  
Will it save me from what I'm goin' through  
Will it ease the pain  
Will it ease the pain  
Will it help to pacify my brain  
He told me not to worry  
He said to come back next week  
He asked me for a picture  
Of the girl who made me lose my sleep  
Well, all week long I suffered  
Didn't know what to do  
But went back to him when the week was  
Through  
And he gave me an artificial you  
And it eased the pain  
Yes, it eased the pain  
It completely satisfied my brain.


Watchin' you move across the floor  
You're fire up my mind can't take it no more  
You're a fancy dancer  
Makin' me blind so I can't see  
You're a fancy dancer  
And you ain't no good for me  
You know you're comin' on strong  
You're my favorite misery  
You captured my soul - imprisoned my heart  
You know you control whatever you start  
You're fancy dancer  
And it ain't too hard to see  
You're fancy dancer  
And you'll make a fool of me  
I know it won't be for long  
Until you dance a new song  
But just for tonight won't you dance your dance for me  
I'm not the first and I won't be the last  
Don't want your future - just make the night last  
C'mon fancy dancer  
Make me blind so I can't see  
You're a fancy dancer  
And you ain't no good for me  
Yeh, we both knew from the start  
You'd try do dance with my heart  
But just for tonight won't you dance your dance for me  


Now is the day  
We're on our way  
Leave all your cares behind  
Set your spirit free  
Just say goodbye  
Take to the sky  
We'll see what we can find  
Come away with me  
We can fly  
Fly away  
We will fly  
Lookin' for a dream  
See the stars above  
And the earth below us spinning  
Come with me my love  
And we'll find  
A new beginning  
We can fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Fly away  
(spread your wings and we'll fly away)  
We will fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Lookin' for a dream  
Stay by my side  
And we will ride  
Our silver charriot  
To the promisand land  
Don't be afraid  
We'll have it made  
With all the love we got  
Take me by the hand  
We can fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Fly away  
(spread our wings and we'll fly away)  
We will fly  
(we will rise up and fly away)  
Lookin' for a dream  
Lookin' for a dream  
Lookin' for a dream  


Friends and lovers  
Saying goodbye to each other  
Their way  
Your way  
  
Gathered in garden and parting in doorways  
And it's over  
Anyway that's what the papers said.  
And I wonder  
  
What was going on inside your head  
You were there  
You were there  
I'd like to ask  
  
Did anybody touch you?  
Come and go it went so fast  
Did anybody touch you?  
Friends and lovers  
  
Turning away from the others  
Your way  
Their way  
Closing their doors and then climbing their  
  
Stairways  
And it's over  
Anyway that's what the people say and I wonder  
Does it really have to be this way  
  
You were there  
You were there I'd like to ask  
Did anybody touch you.  
Come and go it went so fast  
  
Did anybody touch you.  
Come and go it went so fast  
Did anybody touch you?  
Or did you stand alone until the darkness came  
  
Just one more room where everybody knew  
Your name.  
Friends and lovers  
Ever apart from others  
  
Endless hallways  
Just say goodbye and it's over for always  
And it's over  
Didn't you believe me when I said and I wonder  
  
What was going on inside your head  
You were there  
You were there I'd like to ask  
Did anybody touch you?  
  
Come and go it went so fast  
Did anybody touch you?


Hooked On You Lyrics  
Baby if you only knew  
Everything I need I get from you  
I'll never let you out of sight  
I need you through the day and night, baby  
Always there to see me through  
Darlin' don't you know I'm hooked on you  
Habits I've had before  
But never came back so much for more  
I need your lovin' every day  
I couldn't live without it, no way  
And everybody knows it's true  
Everybody knows I'm hooked on you  
Well I've never been dependin'  
and never thought I would  
Oh but now I find that I don't mind,  
the change is for the good  
So don't be feelin' sorry,  
for the freedom that I lost  
'Cause I found out what I'm missin',  
and I'm glad to pay the cost  
Now that I've tasted you  
I know nobody else will ever do  
I'm glad that I can say you're mine  
I love ya 'cause your sugar's so fine  
And no one else'll ever do  
There's nothin' like bein' hooked on you  
Always there to see me through  
Baby that's why I'm hooked on you  
  


Here in the afterglow of what we've done  
What remains here in the after show  
Of what we've seen  
Is it strange to be falling away now  
Or would you say we should have known  
It would end this way and both of us turn to dust  
We went deeper deeper in debt to games and lies  
We got over our head and never realized  
How, when or why  
But now as I sit reflecting on your face  
In my hand  
Now I can see your picture helps retrace  
All the steps we took, places we went to  
Thoughts that we tried, tripping along  
On a love we never understood with no guide  
Many things were taken for granted all along  
Firm foundations never were planted  
All went wrong  
We fell down, and broke in a million pieces  
We couldn't put it all together  
We couldn't put it all together again


There's a reason for the life that you live  
And there's pleasin' that I know you can give  
And I been crayin' the love you been sayin'  
So baby won't you give it to me  
  
You're tellin' me no, no, no  
You don't want to let your love go  
I'm tellin' you yes, yes, yes  
You really oughta be gettin' some happiness  
  
I made a motion and it's out on the floor  
And it's a notion that I'd love to explore  
Cause I been tastin' the love you been wastin'  
So baby won't you give it to me  
  
You're a lady  
And I'm here in the palm of your hand  
Such a lady  
How much more do you think I can stand?


Take away the moment  
That began the lonely night  
Take it away  
And you'll be back in my life  
'Cause I need you back in my life  
Take me back to the time  
When I could live in your light  
If that's the only way to live in your love  
Take me back  
If that's the way for me to live in your love  
Take me back  
  
If I must cling to someone  
Then you must be the someone  
On my own, on my way  
Lookin' back to the day  
Back to the day when I could live in your love  
Take me back  
I got to find a way to live in your love  
Take me back


I know the times the times are hard to bear  
It's hard to find someone to really care  
But before I went down and out  
Here's what I used to think about, think about  
  
London bridge is always fallin' down,  
But there it stood within the heart of town  
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come  
  
The changes taking place are everywhere  
The centuries past have nothing to compare  
Where they stand, where they trip and fall  
Watch the writing on the wall, on the wall  
  
London bridge is fallin' down at last,  
And so another memory of the past  
Has fell beneath the blade, but soon the dead may be repaid  
  
I know things just can't evolve for all eternity  
The thoughts will leave, will never die, and now so you can see  
  
London bridge is finally fallin' down,  
It packed it up and shipped it outta town  
And though the horror's gone, the memory will linger on  
London bridge is finally fallin' down,  
It used to stand within the heart of town  
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come  
London bridge is finally fallin' down


I'm driftin' down the street  
Asking of all i meet  
Don't you know me from somewhere  
Hazel eyes and curly hair  
Have you seen me anywhere  
Look at me  
I'm blending into the wall  
And i wonder if i'm really here at all  
  
Time goes by  
So do i  
But no one blinks an eye  
Mirrors aren't reflecting me  
Laws aren't protecting  
And no one's expecting me  
On the edge  
I feel like i'm going to fall  
And i wonder if i'll never land at well  
  
Loneliness comes and stays  
Torturing nights and days  
People stare but cannot speak  
Hearts are strong  
But tongues are weak  
Maybe all our minds are meek  
Look at me  
I'm fading into the floor  
And wonder if i'm living anymore.  


Lost and all alone.  
I always thought that I could make it on my own.  
But since you left I hardly make it through the day.  
My tears get in the way and I need you back to stay.  
  
I wander through the night  
And search the world to find the words to make it right.  
All I want is just the way it used to be  
With you here close to me.  
And I've got to make you see,  
That I'm lost without your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
And I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel,  
A touch without a feel.  
I can't believe its real.  
And someday soon I'll wake  
And find my heart won't have to break.  
  
Yes, I'm lost without your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
All I want is the way it used to be  
I need you here with me.  
Oh darling can't you see,  
If we had love before,  
We can have it back once more


You say you're down and out  
And need some help to get you through each day  
Well, here's a thought or two  
I've used and like to pass them on your way  
I found them lying there  
The answers that you say you're looking for  
Make what you will of them  
And you can change the way it was before  
  
You got to make it by yourself  
You know you got to make it by yourself  
I'll be your friend and I'll lend a helping hand  
But you got to try and help yourself before I can  
  
I hear you talk of all the happiness  
And emptiness you've known  
Well, let me reassure you  
Never were you really all alone  
They say in quiet desperation many people cannot see  
They cannot see the simple truth  
That's not the way it has to be  
  
You got to find it for yourself  
God helps the man who helps himself, amen  
I am your friend and I'll lend a helping hand  
But you gotta try and help yourself before I can  
  
We got to help each other (each other)  
You got to help your brother when you can  
When you can  
  
Now don't you think that I was preachin'  
I'm just reachin' out for you  
Cause that's the only way  
That I know how to get the message through  
Then you in turn and got to learn and teach it  
To somebody who  
Who felt the happiness and emptiness the same as you


Hey have you ever tried  
Really reaching out for the other side?  
I may be climbing on rainbows  
But baby, here goes  
Dreams, they are for those who sleep  
Life is for us to keep  
And if you're wondering what this song is leading to,  
I wanna to make it with you  
  
I really think that we could make it, girl  
  
Though you don't know me well  
With every little thing only time will tell  
If you believe the things that I do,  
And we'll see it through  
Life can be short or long  
Love can be right or wrong  
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through  
I'd like to make it with you  
  
I really think that we could make it, girl  
  
Baby you know that dreams their for those who sleep  
Life it's for us to keep  
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through  
I'd like to make it with you  
  
I really think that we can make it, girl


Freedom, keep walkin'  
Keep on your toesand don't stop talkin' 'bout  
Freedom, get goin'  
Lots to be learned and lots to be knowin' 'bout  
People, gotta reach 'em  
Sit 'em right down and then you gotta teach 'em 'bout  
Freedom, gotta win it  
Gotta put yourself smack dab in it  
  
Hey tomorrow  
Now don't you go away  
Cause freedom  
Just might come your way  
  
Freedom, keep tryin'  
People stay alive and people keep dyin' for  
Freedom, so don't lose it  
Ya gotta understand ya just can't abuse it  
Freedom, get movin'  
Never gonna stop till everybody's groovin' on  
Love for, one another  
Callin' some friend and callin' some brother  
  
Hey tomorrow  
You're not so far away  
Mother freedom  
We'll know you well someday


And when my drug will start to get me down  
Shes always there you know she always can be found  
And never lifted way to much on me  
She always seems to be in touch with me you see she knows  
And I am drawn to her it is as though  
I were a moth and she the candles' glow  
And when the world has got the best of me  
Shes seems to have the power to change my destiny  
I try to tell her what is on my mind  
And even though the words are hard to find she kknows  
That when she comes to me  
It is as though  
I were the earth and she new fallen snow  
And I will sing of all the things she knows  
She gives me wings with all the things she knows


She Was My Lady  
(David Gates)  
  
No one has heard  
No one has seem her  
Nobody else  
Carin' but me  
She was a child  
She was a woman  
When she was here  
She was my lady  
  
Never before  
Was I dependin'  
Then she came on  
Filled in my life  
She kept me on  
My best behavior  
She was my lord  
She was my savior  
  
She became my sanctuary  
Some place I could lay me down  
She would always help to carry  
All the things that weigh me down  
  
Nobody knew  
How much I loved her  
Not even her  
Not even me  
She was my queen  
She was my lover  
When she was here  
There was no other


Baby I'm through runnin' it's true  
I'd be a fool to try to escape you  
Maybe I'm beat but oh what a sweet surrender  
  
You keep your rights, I'll take your nights  
No one can lose when we turn the lights out  
Tastin' defeat, lovin' that sweet surrender  
  
I'm givin' up myself to you but I didn't really lose at all  
I gave the only love I've known and it never hurt me to fall  
  
Now that it's done, so glad you won  
I know our lives have only begun now  
No more retreat, only my sweet surrender


Take comfort where you find it  
whatever gets you through  
Take comfort don't be blind to it  
You must do what's a right for you  
  
Every one at times must run for cover  
Don't you know you really can't be blamed  
For in this you're just like any other  
There's no need, no need to feel ashamed  
  
Take comfort where you see it  
Whatever makes it right  
Take comfort when you need it  
To help you through the night  
  
By the way we live in our confusion  
And the way that we misspend our youth  
By the time we're stripped of our illusions  
We may find illusions are the truth


Tecolote  
Bread  
(David Gates)  
  
Voodoo woman made a doll of me  
And ever since then I been in misery  
She said I did her pretty little daughter bad  
And ever since then she's been driving me mad  
  
Let me go, let me go, Tecolote  
Set me free, let me be, Tecolote  
  
Drums keep beatin' in my head all night  
Poltergeists knockin' on my left and right  
Pain and a fever running 103  
Just because her daughter wants to marry me  
  
Rather die, rather die than get married  
Let me go, tell her no, tell her no  
  
You heard my story and you now know why  
A strange old woman makes a grown man cry  
And next time a pretty pretty turns your head  
You better take a look at her mother instead  
  
Let me go, let me go, Tecolote  
Let me be, set me free, let me free


I was your first and you were my last  
And we are the journey's end  
I was the blues and you were my sunshine friend  
  
Now I'm your lover, you are my cover  
Keeping the loneliness from me  
You are my chosen one, arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
You are the sea and I am the sailor  
Riding the perfect wave  
I could've drowned but you came around and save me  
She won't play your game  
  
Now I'm your hopes and you are my dreamer  
Helping me see beyond tomorrow  
You are the chosen one, you'll always be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Out of the darkness, out of the shadow  
Oh wherever you go, I'll follow along  
Wherever you lead me, wherever you need me  
I'll bring you my message, I'll bring you my song  
  
You are the chosen one, arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Darlin' I choose you, I'll never use you  
I couldn't abuse you with all that you've done  
You are my sunshine, you are my lifeline  
Forever my sweet wine, forever the one


Hey, didn't you believe me when I told you I was leaving?  
Well, wait a little while and soon you will be believing  
I'm telling you now like I told you before  
That love has got to be something more  
Than a pastime, this is the last time  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the last time that I will say goodbye  
You say it doesn't mean a thing  
Let's see what the future brings  
In the past, I've changed my mind, but  
This has got to be the last time  
  
Well, didn't you believe it when I said you don't know how to love me?  
You, you never understood that you weren't so high above me  
I didn't realize 'til a moment ago  
That time doesn't really go this slow  
And it's past time, this is the last time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you gonna do when nights are getting colder, baby?  
Where ya gonna go, you know you're getting older, baby?  
Guess you're gonna have to be a little bolder, baby  
What you gonna do to satisfy your hunger, baby?  
Oh, don't it seem that everyone's a-getting younger, baby?  
Guess you're gonna have to find yourself another pastime  
Judging from the past, I know it won't be the last time  
  
[Chorus]


You could be the answer to my lonely dream  
It's my only dream  
Dream it every night  
It's about a girl who makes the waters still  
Takes my troubled mind  
And makes it all seem right  
  
Oh what a change, what a change that would be  
I can feel it comin' over me,  
Maybe it's strange, strange to say  
But I can't remember how  
How it used to be.  
  
You could be the answer or another dream  
Just another dream  
How will I know  
I'm afraid to wake up now and face the day  
Comes the light of day  
She'll have to go or stay  
  
Oh what a change, what a change that would be  
Just to wake and find you still here,  
'Cause every time, time before  
When I open up my eyes  
You always disappear.  
  
We could sit and hope that you'll be seen  
We could talk about the world and in between,  
And when the morning light was through  
Then I could see if it was really you.


Oh, my love, why do you keep me waiting?  
What, my love, are you contemplating?  
Time goes by still you never bat an eye,  
Tell me why, my love, do you have to stay far away?  
Late at night while I lay asleepin',  
Pale moonlight through my window weepin',  
I see you in a color fantasy, cover me  
Why, my love, do you have to fade away,  
Have to fade away? why my love, won't you tell me  
Why, my love, do you keep me waiting? why, my love,  
Are you hesitating? time goes by, are you waiting  
For another day? tell me why you think  
Time will never fade away?  


The silken skies that so remind and mesmerize  
And finally blind me  
The downy softness of herself forever lingering  
Behind me  
Never ever has there been  
Nor will ever be again  
One someone to give you love, tenderness and be  
Your friend  
Hanging on till the bitter end  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.  
  
I've tried to look inside myself  
To find the strength from which to draw from  
The view she saw from.  
Since she tried to go too deep  
Limitations brought her down  
And though I'd like to free her mind  
Visitations bring a frown  
I gotta find the place she found  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.  
Where she is no one seems to know  
The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.  
  
The morning mist that melts upon the meadow  
Brings a touch of sorrow  
The one I kissed is all alone  
And may or may not know tomorrow.  
Just an ordinary girl  
To the ordinary eye  
But so much deeper goes the vein  
Like the glittering of gold you want to touch  
Then you gotta hold  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost.


Elton John  
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


In this day and age where changes happen twice as fast  
Sometimes I get wonderin' if anything will last  
People changin' partners like they change their underwear  
Maybe I'm old-fashioned but darlin' I still care.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm yours for life  
Come and be my lifetime  
Come and take the love I have for only one  
Yes I'm yours for life  
Come and share my lifetime  
Share the world until our day is done.  
  
Time that I first saw your face I loved you where you stood  
In your eyes a kindness - told me you were good  
And if the world could share your heart there'd never be a war  
And darlin' if I tried and tried I could not love you more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometime I pray that you will always be the way you always  
Are to me  
'Cause if I lost you to the winds of change then I would cease to be.


One, two, three

Keep telling myself  
Get out of my mind  
The way it feels  
It feels so right  
  
And every night  
I feel the heat  
Close my eyes  
And it comes to me  
  
I confess if I've done it wrong  
But in your eyes I see I'm guilty  
I'm guilty  
  
The stress that keeps me strong  
I feel as though  
My heart is empty  
Cause you're not with me  
  
In my secret place  
Where I drift away  
  
Tell me am I a sinner?  
Tell me am I wrong?  
Something is wrong with the picture  
This is not my fault  
So am I a sinner?  
Am I a sinner?  
  
Don't watch the truth unfold  
Please don't try to see right through me  
When you touch me  
  
You will never know  
Imagination starts to haunt me  
It controls me In my secret place  
Where I drift away  
  
Tell me am I a sinner?  
Tell me am I wrong?  
Something is wrong with the picture  
This is not my fault  
So am I a sinner?  
Am I a sinner?

[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]


[Chorus]  
I never promised you a happy ending  
You never said you wouldn't make me cry  
But summer love will keep us warm long after  
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.  
  
Thinking of you  
And the love of our lives  
In the sweet summertime  
so sad but true (so true, so true)  
We must leave it behind in our heart in our mind.  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Memories can make (they can make)  
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face  
And maybe someday (someday)  
We can be more than friends love will find us again.  
Red leaves and blue tomorrows  
Time will give back the love that we shared on the time that we borrowed  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
We leave behind, the sum my time, our hearts our minds  
They will remind, we won't forget  
The day we met  
The day we cried ooh  
Autumn goodbye  
  
[Chorus]


[Verse 1]  
Let's undo all the distance  
From your guards down to your buttons  
And get lost in your existence  
What you, what you, what you wanna do?  
And if you wanna get real  
And if you wanna get honest  
Then baby you know the deal  
What you wanna do?  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta open up cause it feels much better  
When we open up for each other  
And I know  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
When you know somebody  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
And they know your body  
It's so much better  
[Verse 2]  
Show me what's under your t-shirt  
And bare it like it's your first time  
You take it off like you never  
Like you've never been hurt  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up (open up) cause it feels much better (much better)  
When we open up (open up) for each other (for each other)  
And I know  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
When you know somebody

She's gonna pack her bags  
She's gonna find her way  
She's gonna get right out of this  
She don't want New York  
She don't want L.A.  
  
She's gonna find that special kiss  
She don't want no sleep  
She don't want no high  
Oh, like peaches 'n' cream  
  
She's gonna wish on stars and touch the sky  
Ah, you know what I mean  
  
She wants a good time  
No need to rewind  
She needs to really really find what she wants  
She lands on both feet  
Won't take a back seat  
There's a brave new girl  
And she's comin' out tonight  
  
She's gonna step outside  
Uncover her eyes  
Who knew she could feel so alive  
Her M.O.'s changed  
She don't wanna behave  
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight  
  
Tonight, it's alright  
A brave girl tonight  
  
So she met this man  
He was kinda rough  
He said, girl, what you lookin' for  
She said, I don't know  
  
I go with the flow  
He said, let's get on the floor  
He said, you look real cute with your low ride jeans  
And your pink little baby tee  
  
Let's get a room, girl  
Come and ride with me  
  
She wants a good time  
No need to rewind  
She needs to really really find what she wants  
She lands on both feet  
  
Won't take a back seat  
There's a brave new girl  
And she's coming out tonight  
  
She's gonna step outside  
Uncover her eyes  
Who knew she could feel so alive  
Her M.O.'s changed  
She don't wanna behave  
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight  
  
Tonight, it's alright  
A brave girl tonight  
Tonight, it's alright  
A brave new girl tonight  
  
Keep on  
  
She's gonna step outside  
Uncover her eyes  
Who knew she could feel so alive  
Her M.O.'s changed  
  
She don't wanna behave  
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight  
Tonight it's alright  
A brave girl tonight  
  
Tonight, it's alright  
A brave girl tonight

It's been a while  
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting  
But I'm here now  
  
I know it's been a while  
But I'm glad you came  
And I've been thinking 'bout  
How you say my name  
Got my body spinning  
Like a hurricane  
And it feels like  
You got me going insane  
And I can't get enough  
So let me get it up  
  
Ooh, looks like we're alone now  
You ain't gotta be scared  
Where you going now?  
I'm a have to floss on you  
Let's get it blazin'  
We can turn the heat up if you wanna  
Turn the lights down low if you wanna  
Just wanna move you  
But you're frozen  
That's what I'm saying  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
  
So you warming up yet?  
  
You got me hypnotized  
I never felt this way  
My heart's beating like an 808  
Can you rise to the occasion?  
I'm patiently waiting  
Cause it's getting late  
And I can't get enough  
So let me get it up  
  
Ooh, looks like we're alone now  
You ain't gotta be scared  
Where you going now?  
I'm a have to floss on you  
Let's get it blazin'  
We can turn the heat up if you wanna  
Turn the lights down low if you wanna  
Just wanna move you  
But you're frozen  
That's what I'm saying  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel

Feels kinda good  
Yeah  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Hot (more)  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Hot (more)


I'm on fire!  
  
Don't put me off 'cause I'm on fire  
And I can't quench my desire  
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love  
You're not convinced that that is enough.  
I put myself in this position  
And I deserve the imposition  
But you don't even know I'm alive  
And this pounding in my heart just won't die  
I'm burning up!  
  
Chorus:  
I'm burning up, burning up for your love  
I'm burning up, burning up for your love  
I'm burning up, burning up for your love  
For your love!  
  
You're always closing your door,  
Well that only makes me want you more.  
And day and night I cry for your love,  
You're not convinced that that is enough.  
To justify my wanting you,  
Now tell me what you want me to do  
I'm not blind and I know  
That you want to want me but you can't let go  
Come on, let go!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, do you wanna see me down on my knees?  
Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?  
Unlike the others I'd do anything  
I'm not the same, I have no shame.  
I'm on fire!  
  
I'm on fire!  
  
Come on, let go!  
  
Do you wanna see me down on my knees?  
Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?  
Unlike the others I'd do anything  
I'm not the same, I have no shame.  
I'm on fire!  
  
[Burning up for your love] c'mon c'mon  
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
Come on, come on, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
  
Uh, uh, uh, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
Come on, come on, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up [burning up for your love]  
Uh, uh, uh [burning up for your love]  
  
You know you got me burning up, baby [burning up for your love]  
You know you got me burning up, baby [burning up for your love]  
  
Burning up for your love [burning up for your love]  
Burning up for your love [burning up for your love]


It's never right or wrong with you and me  
We're pure unconscious energy  
And I freeze as your charging through my mind  
That's what it's like with you and me  
(Were?)  
  
Then the spark ignites again  
And I'm electric  
Cause you and I were connected  
And then the stadium lights go on  
And we get hectic  
Cause you and I were connected  
  
To the light that shines in our eyes  
To the beat that's running our lives  
To the sound that's bringing us back again  
(Repeat)  
  
And I know you in and out and you know me  
There's not a thing you got to be  
And I see how your glowing from inside  
That's what it's like with you and me  
(Were?)  
  
Then the spark ignites again  
And I'm electric  
Cause you and I were connected  
And then the stadium lights go on  
And we get hectic  
Cause you and I were connected  
  
To the light that shines in our eyes  
To the beat that's running our lives  
To the sound that's bringing us back again  
(Repeat 2x)


Get with this  
I'll take you, boy  
I'll make you, yeah  
  
My fingertips  
Against your lips  
I'll move my hips  
  
Come with me tonight  
Alright, alright  
I don't really wanna be pushy  
But you got me feeling lovely tonight, tonight  
I don't really wanna be pushy  
But you got me feeling lovely tonight, tonight

Forsake you, I won't

So come with me tonight  
  
Tongight, come with me, yeah  
  
Undressing me  
With your eyes and  
Butterflies come and  
  
Don't hesitate  
Just do your thing  
Baby, don't be lame

So come with me tonight


Forever...  
It's been hours  
Seems like days  
Since you went away  
  
And all I do is check the screen  
To see if you're okay  
You don't answer when I phone  
Guess you want to be left alone  
  
So I'm sending you my heart my soul  
And this is what I'll say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm sorry  
Oh so sorry  
Can't you give me one more chance  
To make it all up to you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
E-mail my heart  
And say our love will never die (and I)  
I know you're out there  
And I know that you still care (I know you care)  
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive  
Forever...e-mail my heart  
  
I can see you in my mind  
Coming on the line  
And opening this letter  
That I've sent a hundred times  
  
Here's a picture of us two (us two)  
I look so good on you (on you)  
And can't you please forgive me  
For the hurt I put you through

You're so bright  
Like a dream  
You burn up  
Everything  
We might make a scene  
Ignite gasoline  
  
When the music goes up  
And the sun goes down  
Lightning strikes  
And I'm on the ground  
Only one that I want around  
Is you,  
Yeah  
  
Spark and it's like gasoline  
I start purring like a machine  
My heart only runs on supreme  
So hot, give me your gasoline

On the floor  
Escape, exit door  
Your touch, burning me  
Is too much, gasoline  
  
When the music goes up  
And the sun goes down  
Lightning strikes  
And I'm on the ground  
Only one that I want around  
Is you

You're always too busy  
Why don't you go with me  
Don't act like you don't hear me  
Neglected  
You're guilty  
He noticed no one was with me  
I started getting so friendly  
He told me I was so pretty  
I flirted  
I'm guilty  
  
I have no reason to lie  
I told you a thousand times  
I needed you by my side, but you were nowhere to be found  
But you pushed your luck  
Now it's all messed up  
But you went too far when you broke my heart and I found my guy  
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs  
Then I guess that makes me guilty  
  
Guilty x6  
  
Stop wondering a thing but

It's true and nobody's angel  
Convict me

Hey, over there  
Please, forgive me  
If I'm comin' on too strong  
Hate to stare  
But, you're winnin'  
And they're playin' my favorite song  
So, come here  
A little closer  
Wanna whisper in your ear  
Make it clear  
A little question  
Wanna know just how you feel  
  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If we could escape the crowd somehow  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?  
'Cause, you feel like paradise  
And I need a vacation tonight  
So, if I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?  
  
Hey, you might think  
That I'm crazy  
But, you know I'm just your type  
I might be  
Little hazy  
But, you just cannot deny  
There's a spark  
In between us  
When we're dancin' on the floor  
I want more  
Wanna see it  
So, I'm askin' you tonight  
  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If we could escape the crowd somehow  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?  
'Cause, you feel like paradise  
And I need a vacation tonight  
So, if I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?  
  
If I said I want your body  
Would you hold it against me?  
Yeah, uh-huh, oh  
  
Give me somethin' good  
Don't wanna wait  
I want it now  
Pop it like a hood  
And show me how you work it out  
  
Alright  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?  
  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If we could escape the crowd somehow  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?  
'Cause, you feel like paradise  
And I need a vacation tonight  
So, if I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me?


[Verse]  
So wicked in the way he moves  
Don't miss it, do not be a fool  
It's a long way, it's a long way home  
Light inside of me, it ignites my bones  
  
[Chorus:]  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
I'll hold on tight  
  
[Verse]  
Remembering, I forever will  
Surrendering just to how it felt  
It's a long way, it's a long way home  
Light inside of me, it ignites my bones  
  
[Chorus:]  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
I'll hold on tight  
  
[Bridge:]  
And when it's over, fond going gray  
The cinema is fading away  
I gotta make my way through the night  
Passing on with all of my might  
And then I'm lost and I can't find the way  
I feel the pieces breaking away  
Hug myself with all of my might  
Don't look down just hold on tight  
  
[Chorus:]  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
I'll hold on tight


My mama told me go on and let you go  
Said you would be more problems than I'd ever know  
Said if he's gonna go then let him go away  
But then I get the urge  
It hurts so bad (damn)  
When I feel the thirst  
It makes me mad  
I look up in my bed  
I look up and there is your face  
  
You love it, you love it  
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)  
You want it, you want it  
You're so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)  
You know you want it bad, babe  
  
I heard it in the streets  
You got another girl  
Yes, it did sting  
But didn't shatter my world (I'm ok)  
You should catch me now  
When I'm in the fall of a state  
  
You're probably thinking to yourself  
This just aint me  
On the contrary  
I was your freak (I was your freak)  
Hit me one more time  
And trust me I'll be ok  
Hey  
  
You love it, you love it  
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)  
You want it, you want it  
You're so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)  
You know you want it bad, babe  
  
Now I will be a bad chick  
If I rounded up my clothes  
And headed over straight to the door  
You wouldn't have a clue  
Of what you should do  
If I left you laying longing for more  
  
You'd be like baby don't go (don't go)  
Baby  
Want some more?  
You want some more?  
Baby don't go (just don't go)  
Said baby please listen  
Don't you just go  
  
Do you lick your lips?  
When you stand alone  
Well you got no x-ray vision  
Staring through my clothes  
Are you sure that you're prepared  
For what comes serves on it's plate  
Wait a minute  
Oooh, I'm having second thoughts  
See my hearts on fault  
Could you pass my shorts?  
Don't you got a girl?  
Till then  
I'm sorry, you must wait  
Especially since I know  
  
You love it, you love it  
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)  
You want it, you want it  
You're so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)  
You know you want it bad, babe  
Hey girl  
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)  
You want it, you want it  
You're so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)  
You know you want it bad, babe  
Hey girl  
  
You know you want it  
So come and get it


Ah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy  
(Crazy)  
Make him call me mama  
(Mama)  
Make him my new baby  
(Baby)  
New way to prove they saying  
Thank you very much  
Later, legend  
You can look but not touch  
'Cause I'm  
  
Cold as fire, baby  
Hot as ice  
If you've ever been to heaven, baby  
This is twice as nice

How can you tell me its not real?  
How can you tell me you don't feel... Like I do.  
We can save this... This is love we don't want to miss.  
  
Some questions can't be answered but how?  
  
Chorus-  
How... How can you do these things to me  
How... I don't know how you can't see  
That you and I... Baby, are meant to be  
  
Sometimes I think... I can move on.  
But how can I do that when when my love is so strong.  
I need you baby, more than you know  
And I try to let these feelings show.  
  
Just tell me how... How can you do this?  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
How  
How can you do this to me  
How  
You said we were meant to be  
How  
I don't understand  
How  
We're not still holding hands  
  
It was a fairy tale while it lasted... And I don't know how but....  
Its over.

Knee socks

Helicopter in the sky

We can go make love together  
You can be my fuck tonight  
We can tear it up tonight

Lately I been stuck imagining  
What I wanna do and what I really think,  
Time to flow out  
Be a little inappropriate  
'Cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I wanna go all the way  
Taking out my freak tonight  
I wanna show  
All the dirt  
I am running through my mind  
  
Lately people got me all tied up  
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt  
Time to blow out  
I've been told who I should do it with  
To keep both my hands above the blanket  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Shame on me (shame on me)  
To need release (to need release)  
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably)  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Ooh, I see you over there  
Don't be shy  
Come here, um!  
  
You got that thing that I can't deny  
So move it over here, oh yeah!  
You're giving signs that I recognize  
Say what you want, oh yeah  
  
Baby, there's something about you  
Show me, that nothing can hold you down  
'Cause I, I must confess  
I'm feeling you right now  
  
[Chorus]  
So, baby, take your chance  
And show your confidence  
Oh, baby, tell me who you are  
You make my body scream  
You make me believe  
that you're what I'm waiting for  
(Don't you be intimidated)  
  
Just be a man  
Show me where you stand  
Positively, oh yeah  
I don't come off shy if you want me back  
And if my E-G-O's, no, don't give up to fast  
  
Baby, there's something about you  
Show me, that nothing can hold you down  
Cause I, I must confess  
I'm feeling you right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y  
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y  
  
It doesn't matter, boo  
As long as you're diggin' me  
So much we can be,  
Yes, it's true  
But first you gotta make the move  
For me to see what I want with you  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Hmm  
Oh oh  
They all say  
I'm ridiculous  
But I've got news for them  
I've got news for us  
  
I'm freaking pissed off  
What's up wit them  
I'm freaking pissed off  
Leave...  
Leave!!!  
  
Chorus::  
Leave me alone  
Let me live my life in peace  
Leave me alone  
What can't you just be  
Normal  
Not those freaking paparazzi people  
Leave me alone  
I'm private  
I've learned my lesson  
So there's no stripping to see  
Yeah  
Leave me alone  
  
Myself  
I am personal  
You don't need to bring me  
To see  
What i have done  
It's not my fault  
You just give me space  
Leave me  
Leave me  
  
Chorus::  
  
Yes  
Leave me  
Leave me  
Leave me  
  
Chorus:: 2x

Tall tale, such a damn shame  
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain  
Kamikaze fire come down  
Fire come down, fire-fire come down  
Left, right, nowhere to turn  
Collecting the ash from the bridges you burned  
Kamikaze fire come down  
Fire come down, fire-fire come down  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Ah) It's too late for apologies  
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now

(Ah) And I'm all listened out  
[Chorus]  
Call, call, call  
But I'm never gonna come  
Baby cry, cry, cry

You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
You can crawl, crawl, crawl  
You can beg and you can plead  
Baby talk, talk, talk  
Keep on lying through your teeth  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
  
[Verse 2]  
I hear you all night, talk in your sleep  
Saying all kinda names but none of them me  
Keeping secrets under your sheets  
Under you sheets, under-under your sheets  
You can cry wolf  
But you know I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, oh no  
I ain't fucking with your dirty, dirty, dirty laundry  
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Ah) It's too late for apologies  
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now  
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees  
(Ah) And I'm all listened out  
  
[Chorus]  
Call, call, call  
But I'm never gonna come  
Baby cry, cry, cry  
You ain't fooling anyone  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
You can crawl, crawl, crawl  
You can beg and you can plead  
Baby talk, talk, talk  
Keep on lying through your teeth  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar

Do you think I'm so naive,  
How dare you play with me,  
I gave you heart and soul, yeah  
Tell me baby please,  
Why are you screwing with my head,  
I don't think you understand,  
I won't take you shit no more ,  
Don't knock on my door,  
  
Not this time because I recognize,  
I've heard it all before,  
And I e I e I,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think about the times that I wasted,  
Think about the times that I took you back, ain't no way I'll be lonely,  
I don't want to let you back in.  
Let's just face it,  
  
I'm better off alone and I won't turn back,  
You thought that I would be lonely,  
I don't want to let you back in.  
  
Don't tell me how to feel,  
Or say that your for real,  
My mind's made up I'm cool without you,  
You've got no more appeal,  
  
Now this girl don't need no man,  
Say she can do what she can,  
Now I live for me,  
Boy does that make you weak,  
  
Not this time because I recognize,  
I've heard it all before,  
And I e I e I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think of times that you made me cry,  
You had me so confused,  
I'm tired of trying,  
Leave behind this,  
What's a girl to do?  
  
Think of all the times you made me sick,  
I used to think I couldn't handle it,  
What you think I'm just another chick,  
Must of ripped boy you must have tripped,  
What were you thinking when you lost my trust, you had it all and now you left
with nothing,  
Oh baby now I know you want my touch,  
And now your lonely and you still want me,  
  
[Chorus]


Champagne, caviar  
Hot boys at the bar  
Lookin' at me  
Yeah, they're lookin' at me  
I was true to you  
Just to prove my point of view  
Now you're lookin' at me  
Yeah, you're lookin' at me  
  
They wanna give it to me  
They wanna give it to me  
But I won't go for that

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Hey, hey, hey  
You think you got me figured out  
But look who's talkin' now, it's me  
  
Fast cars and bubble baths  
High heels steppin' on the gas  
Lookin' at me  
Yeah, they're lookin' at me  
Dreamsicles melt away  
I'm thinkin' every day  
Lookin' at me  
You're still lookin' at me  
I wanna give it to you

But I can't go for that  
'Cause boy it's in the past  
This song is all about me  
Damn right it's all about me  
(La la la la la la)  
(La la la la la la)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Controversy is like  
A ticking time bomb  
Controversy, it's what they want  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Good news for me, it's about  
What I spend my time on  
Controversy is all they want  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
(Chorus 2x)

Love is war  
What are we in it for  
Why do we play the game  
Why are we keeping score  
You and I  
You know we were born to fight  
There's so many times before  
Know I should be sure  
Love is war  
Wash my hands  
Trying to understand  
After all the pain  
We'll take another chance  
I just want to close my eyes  
Forget the reasons why  
Lying here on the floor  
All I want is more  
Love is war  
We hurt the ones we love  
But still don't let them go  
We hold on to the words  
You and I would know  
All these tears are in my eyes  
That's where they'll stay  
It's just easier that way  
Then I turn  
Say that I'm not the one  
I don't feel the sting  
I don't feel anything  
I've gone numb  
From all the damage done  
But I'm lying here on the floor  
So many times before  
Love is war  
Lying here on the floor  
All I want is more  
Love is war


[Verse 1]  
You say we don't talk anymore but  
I'm thinking we talk too much  
Whenever we speak we fight so  
Come talk to me with your touch  
You're playing with fire, and you like it  
A little bit dangerous  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Round and round we go 'til we fall like dominoes  
Oh no  
[Chorus]  
My baby gon' love me down  
Gon' love me down, gon' love me down, yeah

We're better just skin to skin  
I'm treating you real, real nice now  
We'll finish and start again  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Round and round we go 'til we fall like dominoes  
'Til we can't see straight no more  
Oh, no, oh, no

Love to hate you  
  
I'm doing fine  
I'm doing fine  
  
For seven months and fifteen days  
I've been telling you lies in different ways  
I know things will change  
But I don't know when  
You keep talking about us  
Like we still were friends  
  
I just hate the way you talk to me  
I just love to say what's bothering me  
  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
Without you  
  
It wasn't meant to be like this  
All you gave her was one little innocent kiss  
I didn't believe  
She would turn to be  
The love of your life  
Just like me  
  
I just hate the way you talk to me  
I just love to say what you mean to me  
  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
Without you  
  
I'm doing fine  
  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
Without you


This is a story about a girl named Lucky  
  
Early morning, she wakes up  
Knock, knock, knock on the door  
It's time for make-up, perfect smile  
It's you they're all waiting for  
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?" And they say  
  
[Chorus]  
She's so lucky, she's a star  
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking  
If there's nothing missing in my life  
Then why do these tears come at night?  
  
Lost in an image, in a dream  
But there's no one there to wake her up  
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning  
But tell me what happens when it stops?  
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"  
And they say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"  
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky."  
"Oh my god, here she comes!"  
  
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?  
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?  
If there's nothing missing in her life  
Why do tears come at night?  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Yeah, yeah oh  
  
Oh I was broken hearted  
Feeling sad and all alone  
I thought I was going crazy  
  
I thought the pain would last forever  
I thought he'd never ever hurt me and hurt me  
Over and over again  
  
Ohh  
When you tried into my world  
You showed the loving ways of how  
A guy should treat a girl  
The love you give that makes me breathe again  
  
I've found someone who feels me  
An understanding friend till the end  
  
I know the future no one can see  
But I feel deep in my heart  
You will stay with me eternally  
  
So just love me  
Even every day  
And hold me in your arms now  
Please love the hurt away  
  
I'll make it go away, yes I will  
Britney: Oh hurt away (ohhh)  
  
I see heaven in your eyes  
Tell me why would he make you cry, and lie  
He must have been out of his mind  
  
I would never hurt you baby  
Don't let one fool turn you cold (oh no)  
You've got a heart of gold  
  
Heart Of gold  
I love everything about you  
All I know is  
  
Every word I take it straight to you  
A special part of I give for everything I do  
  
Nobody else comes close to the love you give  
Body and soul  
I'm gonna love you for as long as I live  
  
And I know  
It's not easy letting go (No it's not easy)  
But I won't let you fall  
Together you and me  
We've got it all  
  
I just love you  
More and more each day  
I rest my head on your shoulder  
Please love the hurt away  
  
Love the hurt away  
  
I know  
I know the future no one can see  
But I feel deep in my heart  
You will stay with me eternally  
  
I just love you  
More and more each day  
  
(No, oh) Please love the hurt away (ohh yeah)  
Oh my love  
Love the hurt away (oh oh yeah)  
  
Please love the hurt away


It's a crazy little thing called mad love  
It goes something like this  
  
Tangled up in you, uh  
Twisted like I've never been before  
I don't know what you do  
All I know is I want a little more  
  
I don't care if the way that I act doesn't make much sense  
When you're near, something in me reacts and there's no defense  
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real  
All that matters is how this feels  
  
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup  
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love  
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up  
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love  
Oh  
I wanna take you in (Come here)  
A velvet rush is running through mad veins  
Like adrenaline, a kiss from you and I'm going so insane  
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real  
All that matters is how this feels  
  
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup  
Nothing tastes sweeter than my love  
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up  
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love  
  
I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup  
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love  
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up  
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you  
A love long and true  
We'll go on and on and?  
I don't want to hear that I'm too young  
  
To know it's love that makes me feel this way  
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun  
To know it's shining on me every day  
When it's warm outside  
  
And the look in your eyes  
Is longing to show me the way  
I don't want to wait  
  
[Chorus]  
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly  
I see the road laid out in front of me  
You give me strength, you give me hope  
And when you hold me in your arms  
You make me whole  
And I don't know just what I would do  
Without one kiss from you  
  
I don't want to hear my time will come  
When it feels like it's already here  
We should learn to walk before we run  
But why go anywhere when you're so near  
  
'Cause when I reach out to you  
So sad and confused  
And feeling like I could cry  
You dry my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you  
A love long and true  
We'll go on and on and?  
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight  
To last all my life  
On and on and?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight  
To last all my life


You don't have to look like a movie star  
Ooh I think you're good just the way you are  
Tell me if you could would you up and run away, with me?  
  
You don't have to roll like a millionaire  
Baby I would go with you anywhere  
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see  
  
You know can nobody get down like us  
We don't fuck 'till we get enough  
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop  
Break it down, show me what you got  
  
Ooh my my baby don't be shy  
I see that spark flashing in your eye  
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la  
  
Take my hand, we can go all night  
And spin me round just the way I like  
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la  
  
You don't have to wear no designer clothes  
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor  
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free  
  
You know can nobody get down like us  
We don't fuck 'till we get enough  
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop  
Break it down, show me what you got

So baby come with me and be my ooh la la  
  
Baby come with me and be my ooh la la  
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Who can rough me up  
Whose middle name is dangerous  
  
I don't want guarantees  
I don't want promises  
I just want a ride baby I'll never forget  
Got no expectations  
No need for a conversation  
Leave the drama out and just get right down to it  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Verse 2:  
I'm talking damage  
With mystery  
I'll keep ya company tonight  
You bring the leather  
I'll bring the lace  
I'll wear it safe tonight  
I don't want future plans  
You can keep your romance  
You can give it to me baby  
Dying on ice  
We can make memories  
If you'll remember me  
You can have a shot  
Have a piece of lime  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Verse 3:  
All I want is me a really bad boy  
Give it to me like a real bad boy  
All I want is me a really bad boy  
Give it to me like a real bad boy  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is a me a bad, bad boy  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy

Lets Go  
  
All the little girls, dancin', dancin' in the room

Shaking it soft

[Chorus:]  
  
There's a Queen in the the castle  
Queen in the Room  
Shim it to me, shim it to me, shim it to me

(chorus from top)  
  
I now know my Lady Is  
Me Madeover  
  
Yeah, what


You might not believe it  
But trust me this is true  
You fall for their poison  
And become a part of their crew  
I'm in a rebellion  
And I'm up against the truth  
So will you join me?  
Or will you be taken too?  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
Your body starts breaking in  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
Be wary of others  
The ones closest to you  
The poison they feed you  
And the voodoo that they do  
But in rebellion there's a sparkle of truth  
Don't just stand there  
Do what you got to do  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
With everyone yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
The eye that is deceiving is the one trapping us in  
I'm fighting a losing battle and my patience is wearing thin  
But in rebellion there's a glimmer of light  
And nobody claims the crown without some sacrifice  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion


Rock  
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)  
Rock  
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)  
  
Rockin' headspace,  
I'm trippin' out  
This is my place,  
What you're about  
  
If you come over we can fly away  
Together, let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me down and you love me right  
Spin me all around,  
I feel so dizzy, I fall into you  
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me  
You rock me in  
Can ya hold me tight and don't let go?  
Take me in your arms and bring me closer  
Oh I want you,  
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me  
You rock me in  
  
If you want to, we can race  
I'm super fast now,  
You wanna chase?  
I can fake it, because you're mine  
Double time now, so get in line  
  
If you come over we can fly away  
Together, let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rock me in,  
You rock me in  
  
My world is spinnin' round you,  
Don't wanna let you down  
I'm lost when you're around me,  
Take me so far away from here  
  
Look how I'm spinnin' round you,  
Don't wanna let you down  
I'm lost and can't be found now  
Take me down, take me down  
  
If you come over we can fly away  
Together, let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rock me in,  
You rock me in  
  
Rock me in,  
You rock me in  
  
Rock me in,  
You rock me in.


We fell in love and I made you the world  
I spent all my time tryin' to satisfy you, girl  
Just one thing that I can't figure out  
Closer I get, farther baby I am out  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
The roof was leakin' honey where we live  
And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give  
I started loving you but I gotta stop  
You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
You keep me six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
Tried to talk about what's goin' on  
You just smile and tell me "Baby there ain't nothin' wrong"  
In your smile there's a sign in red  
It said "Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead"  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Yeah I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt


Well don't move  
Why don't you listen to what I'm saying  
And hey you  
You better get up if you plan to be staying  
Get loose  
You got to listen to what the band is playing  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  
At school  
The girls you know their dancing, mister 's just my speed  
And hey cool  
If action is the thing you need  
Well don't fool  
The kid's satisfaction guaranteed  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  
Well hey man  
Yeah don't let the little girl sigh  
Understand  
If you just move your body side to side  
Raise your hand  
Shout until you're satisfied  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  


Blind man wavin' by the side of the road  
I'm in a flat bed Ford carrying a heavy load  
With a sweet thing sippin' on a blueberry wine  
On a flat black highway down in Carolina  
Black bird slippin' in a sky of blue  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, honey  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Little boy carryin' a fishin' pole  
Little girl pickin' berries straight off of the vine  
Brown bag filled with a little green toad  
We hook 'em through the lip and throw 'em off of the line  
Your sweet brown legs got me feeling so blue  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Black car shinin' on a Sunday morn  
Mama go to church now, Mama go to church now  
Friday night daddy's shirt is torn  
Daddy's goin' downtown, daddy's goin' downtown  
Ain't no one understand this sweet thing we do  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Field turned up, the seed is sowed  
Rain comin' in from over 'cross the road  
Big black curtain coming 'cross the field  
Blind 'll see, the lame will be healed  
Brown eyed girl, I turned my back on you, now it's lonely  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you,  
Ain't nothin' in this world take away these blues  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you


I was born saved in heaven  
It was nothing like the promised land  
Raised in a good christian house  
Underneath a good christian hand  
I was schooled down and dirty  
Signed a note back to town  
It was there that the workers slaved all week  
Waiting for payday to come around  
  
Break out, come on if you're coming  
Cause baby i just can't stay  
I want to take out the walls of this joint  
I want to blow this town away  
  
Now i ain't into fast livin'  
I ain't into dying young  
And i ain't looking to be forgiven  
For any of the stupid things that i've done  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
A notion it was good to be alive  
Feel the spark, the rush of emotion  
I want to break out baby tonight  
  
I want to dream, that i got a place  
I want to scream in somebody's face  
Make it seem, get out of this muddy race  
All night long  
  
Well all little kings lose their thrones tonight  
All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight  
It was down in the cool dirty living  
With the man with the master plan  
Some girl who can beg forgiveness  
And a ticket to the promised land  
  
Down where they'll tear your guts out  
Making out what you're all about  
Making while we were blasting like a ??  
I want out i want out i want out  
  
Want out to the outside  
Well i'm a small fool  
I want to shout i'm bound for nothing  
I want to shout about something too  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive  
I feel the heat, the rush of devotion  
I want to tear out baby tonight  
  
I wanna do what ain't ever been done  
I wanna win what ain't ever been won  
I wanna lose blow it all away  
I wanna lose what i've always won  
Prove it all night long  
  
I wanna know that i got a place  
I wanna go where i can see your face  
I wanna rock the roof off this place  
I want you to know  
I wanna live


I got a dollar in my pocket  
There ain't a cloud up above  
I got a picture in a locket  
That says baby I love you  
Well if you didn't look then boys  
Then fellas don't go lookin' now  
Well here she comes a-walkin'  
All that heaven will allow  
  
Say hey there mister bouncer  
Now all I want to do is dance  
But I swear I left my wallet  
Back home in my workin' pants  
C'mon Slim slip me in man  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
I can't be late I got a date  
With all that heaven will allow  
  
Rain and storm and dark skies  
Well now they don't mean a thing  
If you got a girl that loves you  
And who wants to wear your ring  
So c'mon mister trouble  
We'll make it through you somehow  
We'll fill this house with all the love  
All that heaven will allow  
  
Now some may want to die young man  
Young and gloriously  
Get it straight now mister  
Hey buddy that ain't me  
'Cause I got something on my mind  
That sets me straight and walkin' proud  
And I want all the time  
All that heaven will allow


I know what it's like to have failed, baby  
With the whole world lookin' on  
I know what it's like to have soared  
And come crashin' like a drunk on a bar room floor  
  
Now you got no reason to trust me  
My confidence is a little rusty  
But if you don't feel like bein' alone  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home  
  
Well now our old fears and failures  
Baby, they do linger  
Like the shadow of that ring  
That was on your finger  
Those days they've come and gone  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home  
  
Love leaves nothin' but shadows and vapor  
We go on, as is our sad nature  
Now it's some old Stones'  
Song the band is trashin'  
But if you feel like dancin'  
Baby, I'm askin'  
  
It's comin' on closing time  
Bartender, he's ringin' last call  
These days I don't stand on pride  
And I ain't afraid to take a fall  
  
So if you're seein' what you like  
Maybe your first choice he's gone  
Well that's all right  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home  
  
Baby, I could walk you all the way home


Well I came by your house the other day, your mother said you went away  
She said there was nothing that I could have done  
There was nothing nobody could say  
Me and you weve known each other ever since we were sixteen  
I wished I would have known I wished I could have called you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise  
We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes  
We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things wed ever  
Seen  
Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid  
Now there aint nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did  
Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere  
In some bus or train traveling along  
In some motel room therell be a radio playing  
And you'll hear me sing this song  
Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between  
And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind  
But just to say I miss you baby, good luck goodbye, bobby jean


Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna shoot you right down  
Take you in my arms  
I'm in love with you  
A love that is true  
Boom boom boom boom  
  
I need you right now  
I mean right now  
I don't mean tomorrow  
I mean right now  
Come on come on  
I wanna give it up babe  
  
Shake it up babe  
Come on and shake  
Shake it up babe  
Come on come on shake it up babe  
  
I like the way you walk  
I like the way you talk  
When you walk that walk  
And you talk that talk  
You knock me out  
Right over my feet  
  
Shake it up babe  
Come on and shake  
Shake it up babe  
Come on come on shake it up babe  
  
Boom boom boom boom  
I wanna shoot you right down  
Take you in my arms  
I'm in love with you  
A love that is true  
Boom boom boom boom


In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream  
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines  
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,  
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line  
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back  
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap  
We gotta get out while we're young  
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run  
  
Yes, girl we were  
  
Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend  
I want to guard your dreams and visions  
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims  
And strap your hands 'cross my engines  
Together we could break this trap  
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back  
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire  
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider  
But I gotta know how it feels  
I want to know if love is wild  
Babe I want to know if love is real  
  
Oh, can you show me  
  
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard  
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors  
And the boys try to look so hard  
The amusement park rises bold and stark  
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist  
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight  
In an everlasting kiss  
  
One, two, three, four!  
  
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive  
Everybody's out on the run tonight  
But there's no place left to hide  
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness  
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul  
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when  
We're gonna get to that place  
Where we really wanna go  
And we'll walk in the sun  
But till then tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run  
  
Oh honey, tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run  
  
Come on Wendy, tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run


As I was walking down the street  
Down the street, down the street  
A pretty girl I chanced to meet  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And he knees was a-knockin' and her shoes was a'rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And her knees was a-knockin' and her shoes was a-rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon


Well there she sits buddy just a-gleaming in the sun  
There to greet a working man when his day is done  
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt  
I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac ranch  
  
Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts  
Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth  
Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back  
And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up your engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
James Dean in that mercury '49  
Junior Johnson runnin' through the woods of Carolina  
Even Burt Reynolds in that black Trans Am  
All gonna meet down at the Cadillac ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight  
Drivin' alone through the Wisconsin night  
You're my last love you're my last chance  
Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac


Well my name is Catherine LeFevre  
I work at the Astrowash on Sunset and Vine  
I drop my kids at school in the morning  
And I pick them up at Mary's just 'fore suppertime  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Well I work down at the car wash  
For a dollar and a dime  
And mister, I hate my boss  
It's at the car wash I'm doing my time  
Pick up my water bottle and my towel, sir  
And I take 'em one by one  
From Mercedes to V.W's  
I do 'em all and I don't favor none  
  
Well someday I'll sing in a night club  
I'll get a million-dollar break  
A handsome man will come here with a contract in his hand  
And say "Catherine, this has all been some mistake"  
  
[Chorus]


Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road  
He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code  
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need  
And then very carefully he'd proceed  
  
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May  
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away  
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim  
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him  
  
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the
word fear  
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear  
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride  
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside  
  
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right  
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights  
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray  
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay  
  
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name  
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away  
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode  
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road  
  
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name  
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain  
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on
her skin so white  
Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light


A lovely, poignant song  
About a man fated to be kept apart from his true love  
  
"well, sometimes I dream of gettin' outta here,  
Headin' down towards them old tracks  
I swore I'd come and get her  
But I know I ain't never goin' back  
  
"there's nights I can't sleep  
No matter how hard I try  
So from my window I watch the moonlight  
Fall on the far hillside  
  
"I imagine I put on my jacket,  
Go down to this little roadside bar  
Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor  
To a mexican guitar"


Well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom crashing  
  
Yeah, flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight  
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night  
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, in the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain  
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightning  
  
Yeah, tolling for the rebel, yeah, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaken  
Yeah tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright now  
  
And then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed  
As the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Well, electric light still struck like arrows  
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
  
Well, tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
And for each un-harmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, starry-eyed and laughing, I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look  
Spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended  
  
Yeah, tolling for the aching ones whose wounds  
Cannot be nursed for the countless confused  
Accused, misused, strung out ones and worse  
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
(Yeah)  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright, now, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa


It's a fairytale so tragic  
There's no prince to break the spell  
I don't believe in the magic  
But for you I will, for you I will  
If I'm a fool, I'll be a fool  
Darlin' for you  
  
I'm countin' on a miracle  
Baby I'm countin' on a miracle  
Darlin' I'm countin' on miracle  
To come through  
  
There ain't no storybook story  
There's no never-ending song  
Our happily ever after Darlin'  
Forever come and gone  
I'm movin' on  
If I'm gonna believe  
I'll put my faith  
Darlin' in you  
  
I'm countin' on a miracle  
Baby I'm countin' on a miracle  
Darlin' I'm countin' on miracle  
To come through  
  
Sleeping beauty awakes from her dream  
With her lover's kiss on her lips  
Your kiss was taken from me  
Now all I have is this...  
  
Your kiss, your kiss, your touch, your touch  
Your heart, your heart, your strength, your strength  
Your hope, your hope, your faith, your faith  
Your face, your face, your love, your love  
Your dream, your dream, your life, your life  
  
I'm runnin' through the forest  
With the wolf at my heels  
My king is lost at midnight  
When the tower bells peal  
We've got no fairytale ending  
In God's hands our fate is complete  
Your heaven's here in my heart  
Our love's this dust beneath my feet  
Just this dust beneath my feet  
If I'm gonna live  
I'll lift my life  
Darlin' to you  
  
I'm countin' on a miracle  
Baby I'm countin' on a miracle  
Darlin' I'm countin' on miracle  
To come through


Every year when summer comes around  
They stretch a banner 'cross the main street in town  
You can feel somethin's happenin' in the air  
Well, from Carol's house up on Telegraph Hill  
You can see the lights going up out in Soldiers Field  
Getting ready, for the county fair  
  
County fair, county fair,  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, hey we're goin' down there  
(hey) Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the country fair  
  
Now you'll be hangin' tight when we hit the top  
And that rollercoaster's ready to drop  
And your braggin', how you wasn't even scared  
Well baby you know I just love the sound  
Of that pipe organ on the merry-go-round  
Baby, down at the county fair  
  
County fair, county fair,  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, hey we're goin' down there  
(hey) Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the country fair  
  
At the north end of the field they set up a stand  
And they got a little rock and roll band  
People dancin' out in the open air  
It's James Young and the Immortal Ones  
Two guitars, (baby) bass and drums  
Just rockin', down at the county fair  
  
(well) County fair, county fair  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, we're goin' down there  
Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the county fair  
  
Now it's getting late before we head back to town  
We let that fortune wheel spin around  
Come on mister tell me what's waiting out there  
On my way out I steal a kiss in the dark  
Hope I can remember where our car's parked  
Baby, out at the county fair  
  
Now off down the highway there's the last stream of cars  
We sit a while in my front yard  
With the radio playin' soft and low  
I pull Carol close to my heart  
And I lean back and stare up at the stars  
Oh I wish, I'd never have to let this moment go


The times are tough now, just getting tougher  
This old world is rough, it's just getting rougher  
Cover me, come on baby, cover me  
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me  
Promise me baby you won't let them find us  
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us  
Cover me, shut the door and cover me  
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me  
  
Outside's the rain, the driving snow  
I can hear the wild wind blowing  
Turn out the light, bolt the door  
I ain't going out there no more  
  
This whole world is out there just trying to score  
I've seen enough I don't want to see any more,  
Cover me, come on and cover me  
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me  
Looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me


First time I crossed my heart  
I was begging baby please  
At your bedside  
Down on my knees  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart  
I crossed my heart,  
Pretty baby over you  
  
Second time I crossed my heart  
Rain came in from the south  
I was lying there with something sweet and salty in my mouth  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart, pretty darling over you.  
  
Well you may think the world's black and white  
And you're dirty or you're clean, son  
You better watch out you don't slip  
Through them spaces in between  
  
Well the night gets sticky  
And the sky gets black  
I grabbed you baby, and you grabbed me back  
And we crossed our hearts  
Mmm we crossed our hearts  
Yeah, I crossed my heart  
Mmmhmmmhmmmm  
  
Well little boys little girls  
Hell they don't know wrongs from their rights,  
And once you cross your heart, you ain't ever supposed to lie  
Well life ain't nothing but a cold, hard ride  
I ain't leaving til I'm satisfied.  
I cross my heart  
Yeah I cross my heart  
Well I cross my heart  
Pretty darling over you  
  
Oohoooohoooh


My feets were flyin' down the street just the other night  
When a Hong Kong special pulled up at the light  
What was inside, man, was just see'est magnifique  
I wanted to hold the bumper and let her drag me down the street  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you  
Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you  
Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you tonight  
  
Sometimes I spot a little stranger standing 'cross the room  
My brain takes a vacation just to give my heart more room  
For one kiss, darling I swear everything I would give  
'Cause SHES A walking, talking reason to live  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well now she might be the talk of high society  
She's probably got a lousy personality  
She might be a heiress to Rockefeller  
She might be a waitress or a bank teller  
She makes the Venus de Milo look like she's got no style  
She make Sheena of the Jungle look meek and mild  
I need a quick shot, Doc, knock me off my feet  
'Cause I'll be minding my own business walking down the street...watchout!  
  
[Chorus:]


Cynthia, when you come walkin' by you're an inspiring sight  
Cynthia, you don't smile or say hi but baby that's alright  
'Cause I don't need to hold you or taste your kiss  
I just like knowin', Cynthia, you exist  
in a world like this  
  
Cynthia, when you pass it seems like this whole town drops  
Cynthia, or maybe it's just me, baby, and these fools stuck here punchin' this
clock  
Well you give us a reason to stop just for a while  
Stop, stand and salute your style  
  
Well now you ain't the finest thing I'll never have  
And when you go the hurt you leave, baby, it ain't so bad  
There ain't a man in this whole town who'd say you ain't fine  
You hear them guys talkin', tell me baby do you mind  
Well you make us happy, honey, when we feel sad  
To see something so good in a world gone bad  
There's still Cynthia  
  
Cynthia, no one knows your number, no one knows where you live  
Cynthia, I wonder do you understand this strange thing you give  
Well baby is it your style, the mystery in your smile  
Or just how cool you walk in a world gone wild  
Tell me if you will, Cynthia  
  
Well I gotta be pretty naive to believe in you  
I know you ain't ever gonna be my dream come true  
That's alright, I got other dreams as good as you, Cynthia  
Yeah now baby, now this ain't no come-on  
Just walk on, Cynthia, walk on  
You make me holler, yeah, yeah, alright  
I said yeah, yeah, alright  
Well she's a yeah, yeah, alright  
I said yeah, yeah, alright


Driving in to darlington county  
Me and wayne on the fourth of july  
Driving in to darlington county  
Looking for some work on the county line  
We drove down from new york city  
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name  
Driving in to darlington city  
Got a union connection with an uncle of waynes  
We drove eight hundred miles without seeing a cop  
We got rock and roll music blasting off the t-top singing  
  
Sha la la la la la la la la, sha la la la la la la  
  
Hey little girl standing on the corner  
Todays your lucky day for sure all right  
Me and my buddy were from new york city  
We got two hundred dollars we want to rock all night  
Girl you're looking at two big spenders  
Why the world don't know what me and wayne might do  
Our pas each own one of the world trade centers  
For a kiss and a smile I'll give mine all to you  
Come on baby take a seat on my fender  
Its a long night and tell me what else were you gonna do  
Just me and you we could  
  
Sha la la...  
  
Little girl sitting in the window  
Aint seen my buddy in seven days  
County man tells me the same thing  
He don't work and he don't get paid  
Little girl you're so young and pretty  
Walk with me and you can have your way  
And well leave this darlington city  
For a ride down that dixie highway  
  
Driving out of darlington county  
My eyes seen the glory of the coming of the lord  
Driving out of darlington county  
Seen wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state troopers ford  
  
Sha la la...


Well ever since you were a little girl  
You set the rules in your little world  
But girls grow up and throw their toys away  
You're a big girl now but you still wanna play  
(Girl we're living)  
You dress them up the way you want to  
(Girl we're living)  
You make them do just what you want them to  
(Girl we're living)  
Once I thought we had a love that was true  
But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
It's all been neatly arranged in your mind  
Every detail fits your own design  
Every room is perfectly in place  
But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face  
You had a plan and darling like a child  
You thought it's down to fashion, down to style  
But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild  
Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
Everything's as you dreamed it would be  
But there's something wrong that you can't see  
Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw  
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall  
Something, girl, that will explain away  
The hurt you feel, darling, when we play  
  
Your little dolls they got grip on you  
Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
We may feel safe and sound  
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Yeah we're living in a dollhouse


I had a job, I had a girl  
I had something going, mister, in this world  
I got laid off down at the lumber yard  
Our love went bad, times got hard  
Now I work down at the car wash  
Where all it ever does is rain  
Don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train  
  
She just said, "Joe, I gotta go  
We had it once, we ain't got it anymore"  
She packed her bags, left me behind  
She bought a ticket on the Central Line  
Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining  
I feel her kiss in the misty rain  
And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train  
  
Last night I heard your voice  
You were crying, crying, you were so alone  
You said your love had never died  
You were waiting for me at home  
Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods  
I ran till I thought my chest would explode  
There in the clearing, beyond the highway  
In the moonlight, our wedding house shone  
I rushed through the yard  
I burst through the front door, my head pounding hard  
Up the stairs I climbed  
The room was dark, our bed was empty  
Then I heard that long whistle whine  
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried  
Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang  
Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain  
Now, don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train


I woke up this morning  
I could barely breathe  
Just an empty impression  
In the bed there you used to be  
I want a kiss from your lips  
I want an eye for an eye  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
Blood on the streets  
Blood flowin' down  
I hear the blood of my blood  
Cryin' from the ground  
  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
Empty sky, empty sky  
I woke up this morning to an empty sky  
  
On the plains of Jordan  
I cut my bow from the wood  
Of this tree of evil  
Of this tree of good  
I want a kiss from your lips  
I want an eye for an eye  
I woke up this morning to the empty sky


It was on the day the cowboys were abandoned from the ranch  
Middle touch world as a master  
They rode their ponies down in the cities of gold  
To leave them for ever after  
Now the sun was swollen red and old  
The earth it was windy, dark and cold  
Were the highway ends the desert takes its toll  
Sodusty, red and angry  
It was a time when men died out on the praire  
From not having a decent friend  
At nights the ghosts to the more of riders  
Was a howl in the candid winds  
  
You can here them crying  
Good god, I think they're dying  
  
When them rangers down in dallas  
Had all, but given it up and left  
And those that hang on hoping  
Was trying their best to, to forget  
The way those outlaws and desperadoes  
Right from the cheapest to the best  
Rode in on ponies made of skin and bones  
Keep up their rusty guns and went back home  
And the governor was sent down from population control  
And marshall all was past  
Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith  
For the time for hope they passed  
  
In the cold blue light of the desert night  
There was a thousand starry ships  
And men came down from still I don't now where  
With death on their fingertips  
Now there's no more kings in texas  
I swear they rounded up each and everyone  
And old atlanta canastoga  
Reached from the rocky mountains into the old dead sun  
Now anna maria walks the blames alone  
The last of a struggling people  
She thinks of all those outlaws who wanted to reach for the skies  
And got stuck up on a steamboat  
Oh, you can hear them crying  
Good god, I think they're dying  
In the wind you can hear them sighing


Early in the morning factory whistle blows,  
Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes,  
Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light,  
It's the working, the working, just the working life.  
  
Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain,  
I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain,  
Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life,  
The working, the working, just the working life.  
  
End of the day, factory whistle cries,  
Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes.  
And you just better believe, boy,  
Somebody's gonna get hurt tonight,  
It's the working, the working, just the working life.


Well now you say you've found another man who does things to you that I can't  
And that no matter what I do it's all over now  
Between me and you girl  
But I can't believe what you say  
No I can't believe what you say  
'Cause baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want to fade away  
Oh I don't want to fade away  
Tell me what can I do what can I say  
'Cause darlin' I don't want to fade away  
  
Well now you say that you've made up your mind  
It's been such a long, long time since it's been good with us  
And that somewhere back along the line you lost your love and I lost your
trust  
Now rooms that once were so bright are filled with the coming night, darlin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You say it's not easy for you  
And that you've been so lonely  
While other girls go out doing what they want to do  
You say that you miss the nights whe we'd go out dancing  
The days when you and I walked as two  
Well girl, I miss them too  
Oh I swear that I do  
Oh girl  
  
Now baby I don't want to be just another useless memory holding you tight  
Or just some other ghost out on the street to whom you stop and politely speak  
When you pass on by vanishing into the night  
Left to vanish into the night  
No baby  
  
[Chorus:]


Well ya know when you're young,  
There's such a distance between you and your family.  
Just can't see things from the same point of view.  
  
Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author,  
And all you want is for them to want you.  
  
Well, I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east
coast.  
And I guess you could say it took california to bring us close.  
There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast.  
And I saw my papa turn away when I need him the most.  
And california, she's an angel.  
Lo, so heavenly dressed  
And the pacific she's a woman  
The lord must have loved her best.  
I got a california rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest  
And the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test  
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes for his own kid.  
And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime  
But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids  
I'll love them all I can and let 'em make their own minds  
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding.  
And my father he once held me close by crying.  
Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing.  
And papa's love it just leaves me smiling.  
Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow,  
Gotta see hen on sunday when she's dressed  
Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best.  
Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest.  
And my family is my friend now california put us through her test.


I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio  
I'm pulling you close, you just say no  
You say you don't like it, but girl I know you're a liar  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
Late at night I'm takin' you home  
I say I want to stay, you say you want to be alone  
You say you don't love me, girl you can't hide your desire  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
You had a hold on me, right from the start  
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart  
My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool  
Well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool  
  
Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah  
You can bet their love they didn't deny  
Your words say split but your words they lie  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
(Repeat)


Dark weekends in the sun out on Chelsea Road  
Descending the stairs, Frankie, my one  
Check your makeup in the mirror c'mon babe let's go  
We'll dance 'round this dirty town 'til the night is all done  
Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight  
Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight  
Don't worry about us, baby, we'll be alright  
  
Well everybody's dying, this town's closing down  
They're all sittin' down at the courthouse waiting for 'em to take the flag
down  
I see strange flashes in the sky up above  
Gonna spend the night at the drive-in with the one that I love  
At dusk the stars all appear on the screen  
Yeah, just like they do each night in my dreams  
But tonight's no dream, Frankie, I can feel myself too  
Well now and forever my love is for you  
  
Walk softly tonight little stranger  
Yeah into these shadows we're passing through  
Talk softly tonight, little angel  
You make all my dream worlds come true  
  
Well lately I've been standing out in the freezing rain  
Readin' them want ads out on Chelsea Road  
I'm winging down the street in search of new games  
Hustling through these nightlights' diamond glow  
Well Frankie I don't know what I'm gonna find  
Maybe nothing at all, maybe a world I can call mine  
Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand  
Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand  
  
Walk softly tonight, little stranger  
Into the shadows where lovers go  
Talk softly to me, little angel  
Whisper your secrets so soft and low


Froggie went a-courtin' and he did ride, a - huh  
Froggie went a-courtin' and he did ride, a - huh  
Froggie went a-courtin' and he did ride  
Sword and pistol by his side, a - huh, a - huh, fare the well  
  
Well he rode down to Miss Mouse's door  
Where he had often been before  
  
He took Miss Mousie on his knee  
Said "Miss Mousie will you marry me"  
  
I'll have to ask my Uncle Rat  
See what he will say to that  
  
Well, Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides  
To think his niece would be a bride  
  
Well, Uncle Rat rode off to town  
To buy his niece a wedding gown  
  
Where will the wedding supper be  
Way down yonder in a hollow tree  
  
What will the wedding supper be  
A fried misquito and a roasted flea  
  
First to come in were to little ants  
Fixing around to have a dance  
  
Next to come in was a bumble bee  
Bouncing a fiddle on his knee  
  
Next to come in was a fat sassy lad  
Thinks himself as big as his dad  
  
Thinks himself a man indeed  
Because he chews the tobacco weed  
  
And next to come in was a big tomcat  
He swallowed the frog and the mouse and the rat


Well she got her daddy's car  
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man now  
And with the radio blasting  
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now  
  
And she'll have fun fun fun  
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away  
(Fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)  
  
Well the girls can't stand her  
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now  
(You walk like an ace now you walk like an ace)  
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now  
(You look like an ace now you look like an ace)  
A lotta guys try to catch her  
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now  
(You drive like an ace now you drive like an ace)  
  
And she'll have fun fun fun  
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away  
(Fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)  
  
(Solo)  
  
Well you knew all along  
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now  
(You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied)  
And since he took your set of keys  
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now  
(You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied)  
  
But you can come along with me  
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now  
(You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied)  
  
And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away  
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)  
And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away  
(Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)  
(Fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)  
(Fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)  
(Fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)

Where the road is dark  
And the seat is soaked  
Where the gun is cocked  
And the bullet's cold  
Where the miles are marked in blood and gold  
I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Got on my dead man's suit  
And my smilin' skull ring  
My lucky graveyard boots  
And a song to sing  
I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way is dark  
And the night is cold  
But one sunny morning we'll rise, I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Well I been out in the desert  
Was doin' my time  
Searching through the dust  
Looking for a sign  
If there's a light up ahead  
Well, buddy, I don't know  
But I got this fever  
Burning in my soul  
So let's take the good times as they come  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way is dark  
And the night is cold  
One sunny morning we'll rise, I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
One sunny morning we'll rise, I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
Yeah I'll meet you further on up the road  
Well I'll meet you further on up the road


Fifteen years Le Bing Son  
Fought side by side with the Americans  
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam  
  
In '75 Saigon fell  
And he left his command  
And brought his family to the promised land  
  
Seabrook Texas and the small towns  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
It was delta country and reminded him of home  
  
He worked as a machinist, put his money away  
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin  
And together they harvested Galveston Bay  
  
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up  
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter  
Steer out through the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company  
In the highlands of Quang Tri  
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai  
And shipped home in '68  
  
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds  
In a boat that'd been his father's  
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son  
And cast his nets into the water  
  
Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell  
And the Communists rolled into Saigon  
He and his friends watched as the refugees came  
Settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up on  
  
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk  
Of America for Americans  
Someone said, "You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out"  
And brought in the Texas klan  
  
One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor  
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea  
In the fire's light shots rang out  
Two Texans lay dead on the ground  
Le stood with a pistol in his hand  
  
A jury acquitted him in self defense  
As before the judge he did stand  
But as he walked down the courthouse steps  
Billy said "My friend, you're a dead man"  
  
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside  
Billy stood in the shadows  
His K-bar knife in his hand  
And the moon slipped behind the clouds  
  
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was as still as glass  
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket  
Took a breath and let him pass  
  
In the early darkness Billy rose up  
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water  
Kissed his sleeping wife  
Headed into the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Of Galveston Bay


I had a friend was a big baseball player  
Back in high school  
He could throw that speedball by you  
Make you look like a fool boy  
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar  
I was walking in, he was walking out  
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks  
But all he kept talking about was  
  
Glory days well they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Well there's a girl that lives up the block  
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads  
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by  
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed  
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up  
I guess it's two years gone by now  
We just sit around talking about the old times,  
She says when she feels like crying  
She starts laughing thinking about  
  
Glory days well they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Think I'm going down to the well tonight  
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill  
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it  
But I probably will  
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture  
A little of the glory, well time slips away  
And leaves you with nothing mister but  
Boring stories of  
  
Glory days yeah they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Yeah they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days

I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade  
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade  
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch  
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul  
Untouched  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Sit down' I stood
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing  
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could
sing  
I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on
standing  
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to
landing  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Come down' I threw
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
  
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard
to hold your breath  
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid  
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little  
Place in the stars  
I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said 'Sit down' I stood
up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up  
Ooh-ooh growin' up


From nowhere through the caravan  
Round the campfire light  
Lovely woman in motion  
With hair as dark as night  
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark  
That hypnotized me with love  
  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
She danced around and round  
  
Guitar's melody  
From the fire her face was aglow  
How she enchanted me  
I'd like to hold her near  
And kiss her hair and whisper in her ear  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
  
All through the caravan  
She was dancing with all the men  
Waiting for the rising sun  
Everyone was having fun  
Hated to see her go  
Knowing that she'll never know  
That I love her  
That I love her  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman  
I love you gypsy woman


Some need gold and some need diamond rings  
Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings  
A promise of a better world to come  
When whatever here is done  
I don't need that sky of blue  
All I know's since I found you, I'm happy when I'm in your arms  
Happy, darling, come the dark  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this  
  
There's a house upon a distant hill  
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring  
Guardian angels, they watch from above  
Watching over the love that they bring  
But at night I feel the darkness near, I awake and I find you near  
I'm happy with you in my arms  
I'm happy with you in my heart  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in love like this  
  
In a world of doubt and fear  
I wake at night and reach to find you near  
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell  
I want more than just a dream to tell  
  
We're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind  
Man and woman circle each other in a cage  
A cage that's been handed down the line  
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars  
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars  
Happy in each other's arms  
Happy, baby, come the dark  
Happy in each other's kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this


My name is Joe Roberts I work for the state  
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville barracks number eight  
I always done an honest job as honest as I could  
I got a brother named Frankie and Frankie ain't no good  
  
Now ever since we was young kids it's been the same come down  
I get a call over the radio Frankie's in trouble downtown  
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away  
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way  
  
Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"  
  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would  
Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good  
  
Well Frankie went in the army back in 1965  
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife  
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we were gettin'  
Robbed  
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job  
  
Yeah we're laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"  
  
I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line  
Man turns his back on his family he ain't no friend of mine  
  
Well the night was like any other, I got a call 'bout quarter to nine  
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line  
There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head  
There was a girl cry'n' at a table and it was Frank, they said  
  
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights  
Well I musta done one hundred and ten through Michigan county that night  
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank  
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates. Behind the wheel was Frank  
  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till a sign said "Canadian border five miles from here"  
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his tail-lights disappear  
  
Me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"


You and me we were the pretenders  
We let it all slip away  
In the end what you don't surrender  
Well the world just strips away  
  
Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers  
Ain't gonna find no miracles here  
Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin'  
I got a deal for you right here  
  
I ain't lookin' for praise or pity  
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch  
I just want someone to talk to  
And a little of that human touch  
Just a little of that human touch  
  
Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town  
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies  
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood  
It's just you and me tonight  
  
Tell me, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want something to hold on to  
And a little of that human touch  
Just a little of that human touch  
  
Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize  
Well it comes at a hard hard price  
You can't shut off the risk and the pain  
Without losin' the love that remains  
We're all riders on this train  
  
So you've been broken and you've been hurt  
Show me somebody who ain't  
Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain  
But, hell, a little touchup  
And a little paint  
  
You might need somethin' to hold on to  
When all the answers, they don't amount to much  
Somebody that you could just to talk to  
And a little of that human touch  
  
Baby, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want to feel you in my arms  
Share a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch


I hauled myself up out of a ditch  
I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch  
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Well I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack  
And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks  
There were empty cities and burning plains  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
We all come up a little short and we go down hard  
These days I spend my time skipping through the dark  
Through the empires of dust I chant your name  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on  
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne  
I sing my song and I sharpen my blade  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Strength is vanity and time is illusion  
I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion  
Your skin touches mine, what else to explain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall  
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all  
When high hope and faith and courage and trust  
Can rise or vanish like dust and dust  
Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game


It's the end of another working day  
Come on and pack your blues away  
Change your clothes, we'll go for a ride  
To the other side  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
Over here it's easier to breathe  
There's a place for you and me  
And there's no devil here to pay  
And come the light of day we pray  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
And together we'll ride the other side  
We'll feel so free, just you and me  
And I'll pray what is due  
Till the night sees us through  
  
And together we'll ride the other side  
We'll feel so free, just you and me  
When this long is day is through  
We will dance in blue  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
It's the end of another working day  
Come and pack your blues away  
It's the end of another working day  
Come on and pack your blues away


Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night  
With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beat-up old Buick but dressed just
like dynamite  
He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street  
But they said, "Johnny, it falls apart so easily, and you know hearts these
days are cheap"  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, "Johnny, you're a cheater"  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, "Johnny, you're a liar"  
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice, said, "Johnny, don't
cry"  
Puerto Rican Jane, oh, won't you tell me, what's your name?  
I want to drive you down to the other side of town  
Where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on Shanty
Lane tonight  
All the golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch-fight  
Pull .38's and kiss their girls goodnight  
  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame  
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe  
  
Well, like a cool Romeo he made his moves, oh, she looked so fine  
Like a late Juliet, she knew she'd never be true but then, she really didn't
mind  
Upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going
home  
She whispered, "Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave
me alone"  
And Johnny cried, "Puerto Rican Jane, word is down, the cops have found the
vein"  
Them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods  
Them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good  
They left the corners, threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each
other goodbye  
  
Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape, watchin' the kids playin' down the
street  
He called down, "Hey little heroes, summer's long, but I guess it ain't very
sweet around here anymore"  
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat  
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on  
And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after
everyone's gone  
  
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and
putting his clothes on  
She says, "Those romantic young boys, all they ever want to do is fight  
Those romantic young boys, they're callin' through the window  
Hey, Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?"  
  
And Johnny whispered, "Goodnight, it's all tight, Jane  
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane  
We may find it out on the street tonight, now, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe"  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
I'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane  
We can find it out on the street tonight, now, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe


The sky was falling and streaked with blood  
I heard you calling me then you disappeared into the dust  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
I need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love give us love  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love  
  
You gave your love to see, in fields of red and autumn brown  
You gave your love to me and lay your young body down  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
I need you near, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love give us love  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love  
  
It was dark, too dark to see, you held me in the light you gave  
You lay your hand on me  
Then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
Up the stairs, into the fire  
I need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire  
  
May your strength give us strength  
May your faith give us faith  
May your hope give us hope  
May your love bring us love...  
  
May your love bring us love


I'll mow your lawn, clean the leaves out your drain  
I'll mend your roof to keep out the rain  
I'll take the work that God provides  
I'm a Jack of all trades, honey, we'll be alright  
  
I'll hammer the nails, and I'll set the stone  
I'll harvest your crops when they're ripe and grown  
I'll pull that engine apart and patch her up 'til she's running right  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
A hurricane blows, brings a hard rain  
When the blue sky breaks, feels like the world's gonna change  
We'll start caring for each other like Jesus said that we might  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
The banker man grows fatter, the working man grows thin  
It's all happened before and it'll happen again  
It'll happen again, they'll bet your life  
I'm a Jack of all trades and, darling, we'll be alright  
  
Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood  
Here we stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood  
There's a new world coming, I can see the light  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
So you use what you've got, and you learn to make do  
You take the old, you make it new  
If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright


You got your book baby with all your fears  
Let me honey and I'll catch your tears  
I'll take your sorrow if you want me to  
Come tomorrow  
That's what I'll do  
Listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Well you say you got no new dreams to touch  
You feel like a stranger babe who knows too much  
You come home late and get undressed  
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness  
Well listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Till every river it runs dry  
Until the sun's torn from the sky  
Till every feel you've felt burst free  
Gone tumblin' down into the sea  
Listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart


Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month  
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none  
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine  
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99  
  
Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop  
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top  
When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind  
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99  
  
Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown  
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down  
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime  
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99  
A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away  
His mama stood up and shouted "Judge don't take my boy this way"  
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make  
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away  
  
Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay  
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away  
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man  
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand  
  
Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead  
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head  
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time  
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that killin' line


The Rangers had a homecoming  
In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland


We took the highway till the road went black  
We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map  
A voice drifted up from the radio  
We saw the voice from long ago  
  
[Chorus]  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
  
The kids asleep in the backseat  
We're just countin' the miles you and me  
We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore  
We just stack the bodies outside the door  
  
The wise men were all fools  
What to do  
  
The sun sets in flames as the city burns  
Another day gone down as the night turns  
And I hold you here in my heart  
As things fall apart  
  
A downtown window flushed with light  
Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five)  
A martyr's silent eyes  
Petition the drivers as we pass by  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Darlin' your tyrants and kings form the same fate  
Strung up at your city gates  
And you're the last to die for a mistake


When I asked you if everything is alright  
You whisper "Don't worry" and you shut out the light  
Now black is black in this bed we're laying  
And I want to believe the words that you're saying  
  
[Chorus]  
But your eyes look like a leavin' train  
They keep on dragging me down  
Your eyes look like a leavin' train  
They keep on draggin'  
They keep on draggin'  
They keep on draggin' me down  
  
Well I did anything just to try to get close to you  
I took it step by step like a man's supposed to  
Tell me now, is this my  
Is this my contrition  
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister  
Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper  
Is my train in vain, has my soul gone to waste  
Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith  
  
[Chorus]


We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flows  
There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow  
I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else  
You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell  
You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell  
You squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealth  
Like you had no further use for, for life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
Why the things that we treasure most slip away in time  
'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind  
Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart  
'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts  
  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
So here's one for the road  
Here's one to your health  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
Life itself  
Life itself  
Life itself  
Life itself


The midnight boys are outside  
Scraping tears up off the street  
Standin' guard beneath the window  
Where only Linda sleeps  
The leader is a kid named Eddie  
Walkin' like an angel in defeat  
He trashes her old man's car, slashes Linda's name in the street  
And calls out  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
  
In a room full of contenders  
Eddy spars 'til he drops to his bed and surrenders Draped in the scarves  
He stole from Linda's bedroom  
The night he laid at her feet  
When the midnight boys were stranded  
Down on Cason Street  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
  
In the basement of St Mary's  
Eddy hides from the rain  
In with the stolen sisters 'til the streets are dry again  
Talkin' fast cars and spare parts  
Empty homes and hearts  
Distant worlds with strange girls  
And kneeling with Linda in the dark  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one


I got lumps in my throat  
When I saw her comin down the aisle  
I got the wiggles in my knees  
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled  
Well there she is again  
Standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
Meanwhile I was thinkin'  
  
Well if she's in the mood  
No need to break it  
I got the chance and I oughta take it  
If she can dance we can make it  
C'mon queenie let's shake it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Won't someone tell me  
Who's the queen standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Meanwhile, I was still thinkin, hmmmm,  
Well if it's a slow one  
We'll omit it  
If it's a rocker, then we'll get it  
If it's a good one, she'll admit it  
C'mon queenie, let's get with it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie...


A letter come blowin' in  
On an ill wind  
Somethin' 'bout me and you  
Never seein' one another again  
  
And what I knew had come  
Stars struck deaf and dumb  
Like when we kissed  
That taste of blood on your tongue  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Don't worry, darlin'  
No baby, don't you fret  
We're livin' in the future  
And none of this has happened yet  
  
Woke up election day  
Sky's gunpowder and shades of grey  
Beneath the dirty sun  
I whistle my time away  
  
Then just about sun down  
You come walkin' through town  
Your boot heels clickin' like  
The barrel of a pistol spinnin' round  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The earth it gave away  
The sea rose towards the sun  
I opened up my heart to you  
It got all damaged and undone  
  
My ship Liberty sailed away  
On a bloody red horizon  
The grounds keeper opened the gates  
And let the wild dogs run  
  
Alone I limp through town  
A lost cowboy at sundown  
Got my monkey on a leash  
Got my ear tuned to the ground  
  
My faith's been torn asunder  
Tell me is that rollin' thunder  
Or just the sinkin' sound  
Of somethin' righteous goin' under  
  
[Chorus]  
  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
  
Na na na na, na na na na-na [Repeat until fade]


Live performance  
Well, I dreamed I was a gypsy riding the land  
With a tambourine and a gypsy queen  
And a rainbow caravan  
Happy old land sailor, yeah, that's what I want to be  
Stealing diamonds from the rich men to throw in the sea  
Singing look toward the land  
'cause the land holds the key  
Keep an eye on the land  
And an eye on man  
  
Well, I dreamed I was a cabin boy  
On an American Clipper line  
Watering flowers for the captain  
That they may not wilt  
Bringing cargo to colonies of South Caroline  
On the best ol' Clipper Dave Mckay ever built  
  
Singing look toward the land  
'cause the land is the key  
Singing keep an eye on the land  
And an eye on the sea  
  
Well, I dreamed I was your lover  
'Cause that's what I want to be  
And I dreamed that every night you dreamed only of me  
And we walked along the beach, and ooh, we held hands  
And I told you you were my only woman  
And I was your only man  
  
Singing look toward the lovers  
For they are the key  
Keep an eye on the lovers  
And an eye on the war machine  
  
Yes I dreamed I was a captain of a river queen  
Caressing Mississippi waters down to New Orleans  
Yeah, a happy ol' riverboat captain, that's what I'd like to be  
And I'd let you ride my honey, I'd let you ride her for free  
  
Singing look toward the river  
'Cause the river's the key  
Keep an eye on the river  
And an eye on the sea  
  
Well, I dreamed I was your friend  
'Cause that's what I want to be  
And every night, you had dreams  
And they were all of me  
We'd walk all the streets together  
Hand in hand  
And be kind to the women  
And the women be kind to the me


They call him mr. outside  
Cause he don't care  
Mr. outside  
He's just havin' his fun  
Mr. outside  
He's just looking out for no. 1  
  
Well mr. outside  
All your money and your power  
Won't help you come the dark hour  
Well kingdoms crumble  
Unto your feet  
You're lest another thief out on the street  
  
Mr. outside  
Yeah he don't care  
Mr. outside  
He's just having his fun  
Mr. outside  
Oh looking out for no. 1  
  
Dark glasses and money for hire  
He got (?) and hight tension wire (?)  
He got dark,dark cadillac  
He got pretty little little girl in back  
  
Mr. outside  
Oh yeah he don't care  
Mr. outside  
He's just having his fun  
Mr. outside  
Just looking out for no. 1  
  
Oh little baby got no diamond ring

You gotta take 'em when they come

Met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast  
She said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast  
Drove around for a while, smoked a few cigarettes  
Took her back to my place, she slipped off her party dress  
She sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin'  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket  
  
Pint of gin in my boot cuff, I'm drivin' for a drink and a dance  
Sittin' on the next stool, miss a little time on her hands  
Yeah I knew she was trouble, but trouble sure was lookin' fine  
And when I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind  
We lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket  
  
I pour another drink, wait for the night to get through  
Stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue  
  
Now I'm sittin' at a red light I feel somethin' tickin' way down  
The night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town  
Got my bags packed in the back and I'm tryin' to get going again  
But red just goes to green and green goes red and then  
Then all I hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket


My name is frank davis, drive up Dixie 109  
I was out on Highway 17, just south of the camden line  
It was down there in heart of Wilsonville, where I met my fate  
She was standing outside a barroom, said she was waitin' for a date  
but I knew that was just a line  
And I knew I was messin' with the losin' kind  
  
well I knew what we were both doin', and I knew that u cant win  
But when the light turned green, I reached across the seat,popped the lock and
she slid in,  
She said she liked Mexican music, she knew a place if I had the time  
So we had a few drinks and we danced for a while,I pulled her close, she didnt
mind  
And what I knew kinda slipped my mind,  
And I couldnt resist her kiss, with the losin' kind  
  
Well we drove around in my Buick, getting drunk and having fun  
We ended up at the Best Western, out on Highway 101  
It was around 3:00a.m., we went out, to this empty little roadside bar  
It was there the cash register was open, it was there I hit that guy real hard  
But I knew, when I hit him, for a second time,  
that one attracts the other, when there the losin' kind  
  
Well I grabbed her hand to get out of there, then I felt like I was gonna be
sick  
About a half hour later the sleet started comin' down,


Each year many die crossing the deserts, mountains, and rivers of our southern
border in search of a better life. Here I follow the journey backwards, from
the body at the river bottom, to the man walking across the desert towards the
banks of the Rio Grande.  
  
For two days the river keeps you down  
Then you rise to the light without a sound  
Past the playgrounds and empty switching yards  
The turtles eat the skin from your eyes, so they lay open to the stars  
  
Your clothes give way to the current and river stone  
'Till every trace of who you ever were is gone  
And the things of the earth they make their claim  
That the things of heaven may do the same  
Goodbye, my darling, for your love I give God thanks,  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Over rivers of stone and ancient ocean beds  
I walk on sandals of twine and tire tread  
My pockets full of dust, my mouth filled with cool stone  
The pale moon opens the earth to its bones  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks  
The touch of your loving fingertips  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Your sweet memory comes on the evenin' wind  
I sleep and dream of holding you in my arms again  
The lights of Brownsville, across the river shine  
A shout rings out and into the silty red river I dive  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks  
A touch of your loving fingertips  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks


I know girl, when you look at me  
You don't know how I feel  
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant  
My feelings I conceal  
But I want you to know  
Oh, I want you to know  
  
I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while  
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile  
Can't wait no more  
Oh, I can't wait no more  
  
Oooh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, to tell you the truth  
It's alway's been you  
I'm all about you  
Oh, girl  
No one can do me the way you do  
It's always been you  
I'm all about you  
  
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind  
Cause a girl like you will come around like  
Once in a million times  
So what do I do?  
Tell me what do I do  
  
And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe  
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll  
Wear my heart on my sleeve  
Got nothin' to lose  
I've got nothin' to lose  
  
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth  
It's always been you  
I'm all about you  
Oh, girl  
No one can do me the way you do  
It's always been you  
I'm all about you  
  
Girl when you smile  
Not a place I'd rather be  
Just stay for a while  
Then you'll see you should be right here with me  
Cause I love everything you do  
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya  
Oh, and now you know  
And now you know  
  
Girl, to tell you the truth  
It's always been you  
I'm all about you  
Oh, girl  
No one can do me the way you do  
It's always been you  
I'm all about you  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I'm all about you  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I'm all about you  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I'm all about you girl  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bruno Mars]  
When you want to do something that's new  
And it seems really, really hard to do  
You feel like quitting, you feel you're through  
Well I have some advice for you  
  
Don't give up  
Keep on trying  
You're gonna make it  
I ain't lying  
Don't give up, don't ever quit  
Try and try and you can do it  
Don't give up, yeah  
  
If you want to catch a ball  
But you're having no luck at all  
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose  
It hits your belly, your chin and toes  
Well, try and try and try again  
Keep on trying until the end  
You put your hands out in the air  
You'll catch the ball  
Yes this I swear  
  
Don't give up,  
Keep on going  
You're on a boat,  
So keep on rowing  
Don't give up, don't ever stop  
Try and try and you'll come out on top  
Don't give up  
  
You got yourself rollerskates  
You put them on  
And you feel great  
You stand up  
Then you fall, don't think you can skate at all  
You get back up, then you trip,  
You skip and tip and slip, and flip  
You try and try and try some more  
Soon you're skating across the floor  
  
Don't give up, keep on moving,  
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving  
Don't give up, don't pack it in  
Try and try, and you'll win  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no  
Don't give up!


Oooohhhh ooohhhh  
  
I used to go out of my mind tryna re define the real meaning of love  
I lost my dignity forgot about me I was so lost in us  
I had to take on, cause you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere  
And my faith it would shake, I know you're trying your best to take me  
  
Chorus: dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Been standing in the way for far too long  
Dream maker now it's taking your place  
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay  
Dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long  
  
You used to be the man of my dreams only now it seems you were just a
nightmare  
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes there's more than darkness
out there  
I'm not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya  
I'm not afraid of ya  
I've escaped from ya  
And my faith is in place  
In the night I no longer see your face!

Staring from my room I see them  
Holding hands wish I could be them  
Lovers doing what we use to do  
(But I'm stuck here alone)  
That's the way it's been here lately  
You're too busy now to save me  
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you  
  
Sometimes I wish I could just let go  
But I love you (I love you)  
And I believe that one day you will come around  
But can you tell me  
  
How do I always end up being the girl at the window  
(Window, window)  
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go  
(You go, you go)  
You give me your word and I always take it  
You say you'll be home but you never make it  
So why do I...  
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)  
The girl at the window  
  
I know you're working that's why you're leaving  
I will never argue your reasons  
If this means that you believe in them  
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart  
Broken promises break my heart  
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye  
  
Sometimes I wish I could just let go  
But I love you (I love you)And I believe that one day you will come around  
But can you tell me  
  
How do I always end up being the girl at the window  
(Window, window)  
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go  
(You go, you go)  
You give me your word and I always take it  
You say you'll be home but you never make it  
So why do I...  
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)  
The girl at the window  
  
How can I be what you're saying  
When you keep turning all the pages  
Am I suppose to believe your words are true  
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you  
I make sure you know I always wanna see you  
Whoa won't you do it for me too  
  
Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window  
(Window, window)  
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go  
(You go, you go)  
You give me your word and I always take it  
You say you'll be home but you never make it  
So why do I...  
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)  
The girl at the window


If you ever leave me baby,  
Leave some morphine at my door  
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication  
To realize what we used to have,  
We don't have it anymore.  
  
There's no religion that could save me  
No matter how long my knees are on the floor  
Ooh so keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'  
Will keep you by my side  
Will keep you from walkin' out the door.  
  
'Cause there'll be no sunlight  
If I lose you, baby  
There'll be no clear skies  
If I lose you, baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain  
  
I'll never be your mother's favorite  
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye  
Ooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing  
Sayin there goes my little girl  
Walkin' with that troublesome guy  
  
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand  
Ooh but little darlin' watch me change their minds  
Yea for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try  
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding  
If that'll make you mine  
  
'Cause there'll be no sunlight  
If I lose you, baby  
There'll be no clear skies  
If I lose you, baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain  
  
Don't you say, goodbye  
Don't you say, goodbye  
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding  
If that'll make it right  
  
'Cause there'll be no sunlight  
If I lose you, baby  
There'll be no clear skies  
If I lose you, baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain

Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you  
  
Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard  
We can go  
No one will know  
Oh c'mon girl

Got a pocket full of cash we can blow  
Shots of Patron  
And it's on girl  
  
Don't say no no no no no  
Just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And we'll go go go go go  
If you're ready, like I'm ready

(Whooo whoooo)  
How do I end up in the same old place,  
Faced again with the same mistakes,  
So stubborn thinkin I know what is right,  
But life proves me wrong everytime,  
Takin roads that lead me nowhere,  
How do I expect to get there,  
But when will I learn to just put you first.  
[Chorus:]  
I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on. Can I move on.  
(Oh)  
When I awake it's you that makes  
Me strong,  
And I know that you've been with me all along,  
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart,  
With you life is so easy why do I  
Make it hard,  
Oh takin' roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.  
(Hey!)  
[Chorus:]  
I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on.  
I get out of my own way, let you have your way.  
Cause I realize I'm no god on my own,  
I'm there for you, I'll sell for you  
I can't live without you.  
Noooo...  
[Chorus:]  
I come to you now when I need you,  
Why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong,  
I was wrong, I was wrong.  
With only you, only you,  
With only you.  
Can I move on,  
Can I move on,  
Can I move on.


Beautiful girls all over the world  
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted  
They got nothin' on you baby  
Nothin' on you baby  
  
They might say hi and I might say hey  
But you shouldn't worry about what they say  
'Cause they got nothin' on you baby  
Nothin' on you baby  
  
No' no' no' nothin' on you babe  
No' no' nothin' on you  
I know you feel where I'm coming from  
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done  
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun  
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)  
With no directions just tryna get some (some)  
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)  
An' so I lost more than I had ever won  
And honestly I ended up with none  
  
There's so much nonsense  
It's on my conscience  
I'm thinking baby I should get it out  
And I don't wanna sound redundant  
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know  
(That you wanna know)  
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)  
'Cause we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)

Even way out there in Tokyo  
Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans  
But you always steal the show (steal the show)  
And just like that girl you got a fro (got a fro)  
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)  
If you never knew well now you know (know, know, know)

We had a date, I stood you up  
You tried to call but I didn't pick up  
See I forgot about our plans..  
Please forgive your man for ruining your night so many times  
I'm sorry, I know you're mad  
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had  
So I'm stopping all these childish things, girl, you mean too much to me  
Your love is worth too much to lose  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
Girl, I'm starting today..  
You're tired of playing the kiss and make up game  
And I apologize for the man I became  
If I could do it all again, I wouldn't hurt my best friend  
And I'd throw away all my selfish ways I'm sorry, I know you're mad  
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had  
So I'm stopping all these childish things, girl, you mean too much to me  
Your love is worth too much to lose  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
Girl, I'm starting today..  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today


I know you're somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away  
I want you back  
I want you back  
My neighbors think I'm crazy  
But they don't understand  
You're all I have  
You're all I have  
  
[Chorus]  
At night when the stars  
Light up my room  
I sit by myself  
Talking to the moon  
Tryin' to get to you  
In hopes you're on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
Oh  
  
I'm feeling like I'm famous  
The talk of the town  
They say I've gone mad  
Yeah I've gone mad  
But they don't know what I know  
  
'Cause when the sun goes down  
someone's talking back  
Yeah they're talking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ah, ah, ah)  
  
Do you ever hear me calling?  
(Ah) oh oh oh  
(Ah) oh oh oh  
'Cause every night  
I'm talking to the moon  
Still trying to get to you  
  
In hopes you're on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
I know you're somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away


Today I don't feel like doing anything  
I just wanna lay in my bed  
Don't feel like picking up my phone  
So leave a message at the tone  
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything  
  
Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan  
Turn the t.v. on  
Throw my hand in my pants  
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no  
  
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie  
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie  
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man  
Oh  
  
Yes I said it  
I said it  
I said it 'cause I can  
  
Today I don't feel like doing anything  
I just wanna lay in my bed  
Don't feel like picking up my phone  
So leave a message at the tone  
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything  
  
Nothing at all  
Ooh hoo ooh hoo  
Hoo ooh ooh  
Nothing at all  
Ooh hoo ooh hoo  
Hoo ooh ooh  
  
Tomorrow I'll wake up do some p90x  
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex  
And she's gonna scream out this is great  
  
I might mess around and get my college degree  
I bet my old man will be so proud of me  
But sorry pops you'll just have to wait  
Oh  
  
Yes I said it  
I said it  
I said it 'cause I can  
  
Today I don't feel like doing anything  
I just wanna lay in my bed  
Don't feel like picking up my phone  
So leave a message at the tone  
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything  
  
No I ain't gonna comb my hair  
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere  
No no no no no no no no no oh  
I'll just strut in my birthday suit  
And let everything hang loose  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Oh, today I don't feel like doing anything  
I just wanna lay in my bed  
Don't feel like picking up my phone  
So leave a message at the tone

Nothing at all  
Ooh hoo ooh hoo

Truth of the matter is I'm complicated  
You're as straight as they come  
You go 'bout your day baby  
While I hide from the sun  
  
It's better if you don't understand  
'Cause you won't know what it's like  
Until you try  
  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side  
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line  
I could wait a whole life time  
But you just gotta decide  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,  
Waiting on the other side  
  
We would live forever  
Who could ask for more  
You could die if you wanted  
But baby what for  
  
It's better if you don't understand  
And you won't know what it's like  
Until you try  
  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side  
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line  
I could wait a whole life time  
But you just gotta decide  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,  
Waiting on the other side  
  
If they say life's a dream  
Call this insomnia  
'Cause this ain't Wonderland  
It damn sure ain't Narnia  
And once you cross the line  
You can't change your mind  
Yeah I'm a monster  
But I'm no Frankenstein  
And quite frankly  
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes  
I really can't explain what I feel inside  
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide  
Many have tried to go into the night  
Cross over the line and come back alive  
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side  
  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side  
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line  
I could wait a whole life time  
But you just gotta decide  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,  
Waiting on the other side  
  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand


Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is.  
But I'm a tell you what true love is.  
Love is not what you see in the movies.  
It's not the ecstasy, it's not what you see in that scene  
You know what I mean? I'm telling you right now, true love is sacrifice.  
Always thinking my mind it's waiting for you if you crossing the  
This love is true, now are we alive  
And I know that you gone, so gone  
The signs I got, this feeling  
Cause what I found, this is deeper than life  
I know that I get lost in this feeling  
I can see all in me, all in me, all in me  
  
[Chorus:] x 2  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love, this is my love  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love, this is my love  
  
Therefore, a thought in my heart, could that be searching for you  
An universe for 2, so please ride through  
Now I'm away and you see that it's fate, it's fate  
The signs I got, this feeling  
Cause what I found, this is deeper than life  
I know that I get lost in this feeling  
I can see all in me, all in me, all in me  
  
[Chorus:] x 2  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love, this is my love  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love, this is my love.


I've been working hard so long  
Seems like pain has been my only friend  
My fragile heart's been done so wrong  
I wondered if I'd ever heal again  
  
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same  
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin'  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
Yesterday has come and gone  
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is  
And I see that I was wrong  
For ever doubting I could win  
  
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same  
All around me I can feel a change (ohh)  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
Life's too short to have regrets  
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget  
Only have one life to live  
So you better make the best of it  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
  
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin  
I know I can make it, today my life begins  
Today my life begins...

You're everything I see in my dreams  
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true  
  
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine  
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine  
  
Treasure, that is what you are  
Honey you're my golden star  
You know you can make my wish come true  
If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you  
  
You are my treasure, you are my treasure  
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are  
You are my treasure, you are my treasure  
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are  
  
Treasure, that is what you are  
Honey you're my golden star  
You know you can make my wish come true  
If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you


[Verse:]  
I, I, I don't know why why  
It seems like every other night you pick a fight, fight  
And I know I do the same, be callin' you out your name,  
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You tell me to go, I start walking out  
But we both know what we're all about  
We fuss, fight, and scream  
And it's all because of love  
But you and I both of we ain't ever giving up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Baby, before you say, say,  
Something you know you'll take back later on today, day.  
Sometimes you drive me crazy, but I love ya, baby  
All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me, ooohh...  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You tell me to go, I start walking out  
But we both know what we're all about  
We fuss, fight, and scream  
And it's all because of love  
But you and I both of we ain't ever giving up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around  
  
Aint Nobody That Could Love Me  
Like You Love Me  
That's Why I Always Turn Around  
For you You Y-You You You...  
  
[Bridge:]  
Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.  
That's why I always turn around for you, you you, youuu... You, you, you,
youuu...  
Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.  
That's why I always turn around. For you, you you, youuuu... You, you yooou...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around


Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
'Cause since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Did you have to go to jail  
Put your house on up for sale  
Did you get a good lawyer?  
  
Hope you didn't catch a tan  
Hope you find the right man  
Who'll fix it for you  
Are you shopping anywhere  
Changed the color of your hair  
Are you busy?  
  
And did you have to pay that fine  
You was dodging all the time  
Are you still busy?  
  
Since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
? Cause since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Valerie valerie valerie valerie  
Why don't you come on over valerie?


All alone in my room  
Waiting for, for this phone to ring  
She'll come home someday soon  
I just know or am I imagining things  
The voices in my head keep saying  
(The voices in my head)  
She's coming back to you  
  
Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
What do I do (what do I do)  
There's no more you (there's no more you)  
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)  
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)  
Voices in my head  
The voices, the voices, the voices  
Voices in my head  
The voices (oh), the voices, the voices  
  
Someone's there at the door  
This is her I just know (I just know)  
I put on a smile  
Oh but I it's just the mail again (the mail again)  
The playing in my mind (the playing in my mind)  
Saying she'll come back this time  
  
Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
What do I do (what do I do)  
There's no more you (there's no more you)  
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)  
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)  
Voices in my head  
It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok  
Oh just gotta get through the day  
It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok  
Oh I just gotta get through  
The voices in my head (the voices in my head)  
Keep saying she's coming back to you  
  
Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
What do I do (what do I do)  
There's no more you (there's no more you)  
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)  
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)  
Voices in my head  
Oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now  
Our song on the radio but it doesn't sound the same  
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down  
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name  
  
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh ooh hoo hoo  
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours  
When I had the chance  
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance  
  
Now my baby's dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
  
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways  
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life  
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh  
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes  
  
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours  
When I had the chance  
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance  
  
Now my baby's dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
  
Although it hurts  
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong  
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late  
To try and apologize for my mistakes  
But I just want you to know  
  
I hope he buys you flowers  
I hope he holds your hand  
Give you all his hours  
When he has the chance  
Take you to every party  
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance  
Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man  
Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man


Tommy Still drives that ol' pickup truck  
He had back in high school  
He says he won't trade it in  
'Cause they don't make 'em like they used to  
His wife Donna's got a picture of Elvis  
By the clock in the kitchen  
Her hair and Clothes come back in style  
Ever now and then  
They made a promise on their wedding day  
Nothin's gonna take this feeling away  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Tommy spent years fixin' wheels and brakes  
at the texaco on the highway  
Donna kept the kids and did Permanent waves  
At the beauty shop on fridays  
It's been forty years but who'd ever know  
By the way they carry on  
Just the same two kids as much in love  
as the day they married on  
They made a promise on there wedding day  
Nothings gonna take this feeling away  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Gonna die young  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
They're still gonna die young  


I can't believe that I've found you  
Fate did a number on me  
If you end up with my arms around you  
It's meant to be  
  
Well, maybe my crazy is showing  
But maybe I'm hooked on your touch  
But wherever my life is going  
There ain't no rush  
'Cause  
  
Wherever you're going  
I'd like to go too  
If you don't have anything  
Better to do  
I'd love to spend  
Some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
I'll take the blue with the gray days  
I just pray the road will be long  
'Cause if I'm beside you there's no way  
I can go wrong  
  
Wherever you're going  
I'd like to go too  
If you don't have anything  
Better to do  
I'd love to spend  
Some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
I'd love to spend some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
What are you doing  
Between now and forever


On the front page of the paper  
Speeding window of a train  
On a billboard on a highway  
It always looks the same  
A smile out of nowhere,  
Stops me in my tracks  
Can't believe that after all this time  
You still have that kind of impact  
  
Everywhere I turn I see your face  
Proving that a fool's love never fades  
In my mind your image is forever burned  
I keep trying not to stare but your always there  
Everywhere I turn  
  
In a steamed up cafe window  
I spell out your name  
I watch people run across the street  
Through the pouring rain  
There you are again so easy to find  
Under the umbrella in another woman's eyes  
  
Well I thought I'd suffered long enough for you babe  
And my mind would let go of the pain, any day  
But it don't work that way....


Standing in a field of three leaf clovers  
Waiting for the rain to pass over  
No rainbows, on my shoulder  
Just the weight of walking day to day  
Nothing shiny coming along the way  
Then I saw you and I reached out  
(ain't) no more blue, now I understand why  
  
How lucky I am lucky I am  
To be the one who fills your eyes  
Blowin' away, sails on a lake  
Flyin' like a flag in the sky  
Bright colored balloons in the wind  
That's how lucky I am  
(how lucky I am)  
  
Now the road is rising up to meet me  
And my half empty cup is filled completely  
And I'm drinking that sweet taste of rain  
So grateful for each moment I get  
To have found you  
I could have walked on by  
But the stars were on my side


I know the sound of each rock and stone  
And I embrace what others fear  
You are not to roam in this forgotten place  
Just the likes of me are welcome here  
  
Everything breathes and I know each breath  
For me it means life, for others, it's death  
It's perfectly in balance, perfectly planned  
More than enough for this man  
  
Like every tree, stands on it's own  
Reaching for the sky, I stand alone  
I share my world with no one else  
All by myself, I stand alone  
  
I seen your world with these very eyes  
Don't come any closer, don't even try  
I've felt all the pain and heard all the lies  
But in my world there's no compromise  
  
Like every tree, stands on it's own  
Reaching for the sky, I stand alone  
I share my world with no one else  
All by myself, I stand alone  
  
All by myself, I stand alone  
All by myself, I stand alone


You didn't notice me right beside you  
I said you looked like someone that I knew  
A little lie to get you to talk to me awhile  
You're eyes oh how they melt me  
  
Your smile, girl heaven help me  
Your lips kiss and tell me a thing or two  
Oh, the happy ending this could be  
Swept away in love and all it's glory  
  
One minute hearts are lonely  
The next each other's only  
Then darlin', I just know we'd fall that fast  
So don't you ever think it can't  
  
Love happens just like that  
I could try and act like I don't care  
But, bein' shy that gets me nowhere  
Though I admit, I'm a little bit scared to talk to you  
  
A risk, yeah maybe  
But it's one worth taking  
'Cause I see a love in the making here with you  
Oh, the happy ending this could be  
  
Swept away in love and all it's glory  
One minute hearts are lonely  
The next each other's only  
Then darlin', I just know we'd fall that fast  
  
So don't you ever think it can't  
Love happens just like  
Lightning striking, flames igniting  
In an instant, souls igniting  
  
One minute hearts are lonely  
Then the next each other's only  
Then darlin' I just know we'd fall that fast  
So don't you ever think it can't  
  
Love happens just like  
Don't you ever think it can't  
Love happens just like that  
It happens just like that  
  
Love happens just like that


STILL GOT YOUR PICTURE UP ON THE WALL  
I CAN'T TAKE' EM DOWN  
I KEEP EXPECTING YOU TO CALL  
BUT YOU DON'T MAKE A SOUND  
TIME AIN'T SUPPOSED TO PASS THIS SLOW  
I SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN YOU LONG AGO  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  
  
I'M TIRED OF PUTTING IT OFF TILL TOMORROW  
SHOULD'VE DONE IT YESTERDAY  
NO GAIN IN DROWNING IN MY SORROW  
AND JUST WASTING AWAY  
JUST WHEN I THINK I GOT IT MADE  
YOU NEVER FAIL TO GET IN THE WAY  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  
  
BRIDGE:  
IF I COULD JUST CONVINCE MYSELF  
TO OPEN MY EYES AND SEE  
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE FOR ME  
THEN I COULD START ALL OVER  
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE  
AND BE FREE FROM YOUR MEMORY  
I COULD BE FREE  
  
(YOU SEE) YOU'RE STILL HERE AFTER ALL THIS TIME  
AND I CAN'T ERASE YOU FROM MY MIND  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND  
NEVER GET AROUND, BABY  
NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  


I've got a four leaf clover  
I hung a horseshoe on the wall  
I threw salt over my left shoulder  
I'll try anything at all  
To get lucky with you  
I want you so much  
Until you want me too  
I ain't gonna give up  
  
I'll throw another nickel in the well  
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help  
To make my dreams come true  
Just in case you're out in your backyard  
Lookin' up there too  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
You'll fall like I fell  
I'll just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
If I could get Houdini  
To teach me a trick or two  
Then maybe you would see me  
In the way I want you to  
Gonna knock on wood  
It ain't been easy  
I've done everything I could  
To make you need me  
  
I'll throw another nickel in the well  
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help  
To make my dreams come true  
Just in case you're out in your backyard  
Lookin' up there too  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
You'll fall like I fell  
I'll just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
You'll fall like I fell  
I'll just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
Yeah, just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well


I'd be foolin' myself, thinkin' I've got it made  
I just can't assume true love won't fade  
I'll keep on listenin' to her, say I'm glad that I found her  
Keep on showin' her how my world turns around her  
'Cause  
  
On any given night  
She could walk away  
She won't be mine for the takin'  
And that's the price that I'd pay  
'Cause love's ever-changin'  
And in the blink of an eye  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night  
  
She's the sensitive kind, she needs a connection  
And cannot be so blind to lose my direction  
I'll keep on walkin' that mile, show her how far I'll go  
Keep on letting her hear all she needs to know  
  
On any given night  
She could walk away  
She won't be mine for the takin'  
And that's the price that I'd pay  
'Cause love's ever-changin'  
And in the blink of an eye  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night  
  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night


Rebecca Lynn grew up in Carolina  
Half a mile from Tucker Cherry's farm  
A quiet girl with green eyes full of fire  
Her daddy's pride and all her mama's charm  
Rebecca Lynn became my heart's desire  
Long about the start of second grade  
Mrs. Roosenbloom let me sit beside her  
So we'd pass notes and after school we'd play  
  
[Chorus]  
Singing ring around the rosie  
Pocket full of dreams and posies  
Patty cake and baker's man  
Tag your it, kick the can  
  
And I think I hear my mama calling  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
High school days with me and Becky learning what it really means to be in love  
Give and take, holding back for Heaven's sake  
And fighting for a week and making up  
I said please Becky won't you marry me  
Prom night in my car out by the curb  
She was so surprised, first she laughed and then she cried  
And somewhere in my heart I'm sure I heard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama flashed the porch light for me  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
When love is wrong it dies and that's the way it goes  
But when it's right, your love grows  
  
Laura Jean was born in Tennessee  
Now that's a common little miracle I know.  
But for me and Becky Lynn she's the dream that started  
When we fell in love so many years ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I think I hear your mama calling  
Gotta go  
Oh man I loved you so


On a tree inside a heart  
A dull boyscout knife  
Took half a day to carve  
Michael loves Caroline  
He just turned ten and she was nine  
  
The summer she turned sweet sixteen  
He finally found his nerve  
And took her out to see  
And what she saw through her tears  
Were seven hearts for seven years  
  
CHORUS:  
And they stood beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watch their feelings grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
The tenth time he carved their names  
Caroline's dad was giving her away  
There beneath the shelter of  
The tree of hearts they pledged their love  
  
And then four hearts down the road  
They brought the first of two born home  
  
CHORUS:  
And they played beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watched their children grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
BRIDGE:  
In the blinking of an eye  
Somehow fifty-seven hears flew by  
  
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine  
Sixty he missed Caroline  
At sixty-one Michael knew  
There wouldn't be a sixty-two  
  
CHORUS:  
Now they lay beneath the tree of hearts  
An you can watch their love still grow  
Where they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts.


Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is a bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song as we go along  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "No man"  
But you can do the job, you're in town  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'?  
Though, your nose gets a little chilly  
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "No man"  
You can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid the plans that we made  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland


Well this old world can get you down  
And leave you spinning 'round and 'round  
Not knowing what's for real  
On this crazy wheel  
  
Is part of the deal, baby  
There's only one sure thing I know  
I never want to let you go  
I'll be here by your side  
On this circus ride  
  
Through every drop and climb  
'til the end of time  
When everything is moving fast  
It's hard to stay together  
I know that we can make it last  
We'll find a way to weather  
  
Any storm heaven sends  
We'll see it through to the end  
We've got it made if you can just believe  
You'll always be loved by me  
  
And when you go to bed at night  
And I'm not there to hold you tight  
I'll love you from afar  
No matter where you are  
I'll count the days 'til when  
I'm with you again  
  
And when we're growin' old  
I'll be the one to hold you close  
When everything is fading fast  
We'll face the end together  
We'll find a way to make it past  
One final storm to weather  
  
And even after the end  
I will be with you again  
We've got it made if you can just believe  
You'll always be loved by me


Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot  
Watching the sun set  
I'll never forget  
Watching all the reds and oranges slip away  
Letting go of yet another dirty day  
  
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars  
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun, the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
  
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot  
Watching you leave me  
Not quite believing  
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot  
Watching the sun set  
I'll never forget  
  
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars  
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun, the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars  
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun, the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun, the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the, the sun, go down  


So you'll be an Austrian nobleman  
Commissioning a symphony in see  
Which defies all earthly descriptions  
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C  
  
With money you squeeze from the peasants  
To your nephew you can give it as a present  
This magnificent symphony in see  
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C  
  
Completely filling the palace concert hall  
It's warm and golden like an oven that's wide open  
It has a melody both happy and sad  
Built on victorious known triads  
  
You enter the room with great caution  
Though no-one in the hall is even watching  
They are transfixed, they are forgetting just to breathe  
They are so taken by your symphony in C  
  
You are sitting there thinking your thoughts  
They are not about what is but what is not  
You are sitting there breathing in your breath  
You are seldom breathing life but mostly death  
  
So you'll be an Austrian nobleman  
Commissioning a symphony in C  
Which defies all earthly descriptions  
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C


In the brown shag carpet of a cheap motel  
In the dark and dusty corner by the TV shelf  
Is a small reminder of a simpler time  
When a crumpled up pair of trousers cost a brand new dime  
Well you ask me how I made it through and how my mint condition could belong
to you  
When I'm on the ground I roll through town  
I'm a president you don't remember getting kicked around  
I'm a dime  
I'm fine  
And I shine I'm freshly minted  
I am determined not to be dented  
By a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented  
  
I'm a dime  
I'm fine  
And I shine  
In the hiss and rumble of the freeway sounds  
As the afternoon commuters drive their cars around  
There's a ringle jingle near the underpass  
There's a sparkle near the fast food garbage and roadside trash  
I'm a dime  
I'm fine  
And I shine I'm freshly minted  
I'm silver-plated I'm underrated  
You won't even pick me up because I'm not enough for a local phone call  
  
I'm a dime  
I'm fine  
And I shine  
I'm a dime  
I'm fine  
And I shine  
I'm a dime  
I'm fine  
And I shine


People you love  
Will turn their backs on you.  
You'll lose your hair,  
your teeth,  
your knife will fall out of it's sheath.  
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie.  
  
People you hate  
Will get their hooks into you.  
They'll pull you down,  
you'll frown,  
they'll tar you and drag you through town.  
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie.  
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show.  
  
People you hate

To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
End is the only part of the word  
That I heard  
Call me morbid or absurd  
But  
  
To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
End is the only part of the word  
That I heard  
Call me morbid or absurd  
But  
  
To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
When I go fishing  
for the words  
I am wishing you would say to me,  
I am really only praying that  
The words you'll soon be saying  
Might betray  
  
The way you feel about me  
But to me,  
Coming from you,  
Friend is a four letter word


You have always got to move,  
You're always trying to prove that,  
There is something new in,  
Everything you do.  
  
You are mostly in your car,  
You always seem so far,  
No matter where you are,  
You're thinking of your car,  
  
And everything you say,  
Is really just a play,  
For you to get your way,  
And I found out yesterday,  
That no matter what you say,  
And no matter what you do,  
That you have got to  
  
You have always got to move,  
You're racing just to prove that,  
There is something new,  
In everything you do.  
  
You are mostly on the phone,  
You say you're coming home,  
You say you're all alone,  
But I know you're not alone.  
  
And everything you say,  
Is really just a play,  
For you to get your way,  
And I found out yesterday,  
That no matter what you say,  
And no matter what you do,  
That you have got to move.  
  
You have always got to move,  
You're racing just to prove that,  
There is something new in,  
Everything you do.  
Everything you do.  
Everything you do.


I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment  
Waiting for your phone calls all to end  
I'm sitting, watching wind blow, watching time go, watching cars go by  
I'm waiting for these memories to begin  
  
If I threw my guitar  
Out the window so far down  
Would I start to regret it?  
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall?  
  
Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here  
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint  
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot  
I don't think that I'll ever be the same  
  
If I threw my guitar  
Out the window so far down  
Would I start to regret it?  
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall?  
  
If I threw my guitar  
Out the window so far down  
Would I start to regret it?  
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall?  


If you loved me half as much as I love you  
You wouldnt worry me half as much as you do  
Youre nice to me when theres no one else around  
You only build me up to bring me down  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldnt stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never be this blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
If you loved me half as much as I love you  
You wouldnt worry me half as much as you do  
Youre nice to me when theres no one else around  
You only build me up to bring me down  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldnt stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never be this blue  
If you only loved me half as much  
If you only loved me half as much  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you


I have a heart that's made of wood  
And I am only biding time  
Only reciting memorized lines  
  
And I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
  
I have no love but only goals  
How very empty is my soul  
It is a soul that feels no thrill  
It is a soul that could easily kill  
  
And I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
Yeah yeah  
  
I am intrinsically no good  
I have a heart that's made of wood  
And I am only biding time  
Only reciting memorized lines  
  
And I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment


She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
They laugh they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa.  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's a good man  
  
She doesn't care just as long as she still has her friends  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
they laugh, they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa  
  
She's got a serrated edge  
  
that she moves back and forth  
  
It's such a simple machine she doesn't have to use force  
  
When she gets what she wants,  
  
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag  
  
[REPEAT]  
  
...in the freezer  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in

It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's raining outside  
You've nowhere to hide  
  
She's asking you why you think it's funny  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
She's leaving your house  
  
She had to get out  
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
You lie on the floor  
  
She's slamming your door  
She's gone and she's wearing your red sweater  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
Aw no  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down


  
  
  
  
Jesus wrote a blank check  
  
One I haven't cashed quite yet.  
  
I hope I've got a little more time.  
  
I hope it's not the end of the line.  
  
Yeah Jesus wrote a blank check.  
  
One I haven't cashed yet all right.  
  
But if I had to choose a number  
  
I'd want it to be number one.  
  
I don't want to be number two.  
  
Yeah I don't want to be number four.  
  
But I can hear a knock on the door.  
  
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right.  
  
If Jesus saw me dying,  
  
Would angels come a flying down?  
  
I hope I've got a little more time.  
  
I hope somebody lends me a dime.  
  
Now, Jesus wrote a blank check.  
  
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet.  
  
Still I build my towers high.  
  
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky.  
  
Still I wallow in the mire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I build my towers high.  
  
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky.  
  
Still I wallow in the mire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
  


Well Jolene unlocked the thick breezeway door  
Like she'd done one hundred times before.  
Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror.  
She folded the towel carefully and put it back in place.  
  
Yeah I want to pull you down into bed.  
I want to cast your face in lead.  
Well every time I pull you close  
Push my face into your hair  
  
Cream rinse and tobacco smoke  
That sickly scent is always always there.  
Jolene heard her father's uneven snores.  
Right then she knew there must be something more.  
  
Jolene heard the singing in the forest.  
She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night.  
Yeah I want to throw you out into space.  
I want to do whatever it takes, takes, takes.  
  
Well every time I pull you close,  
Push my face into your hair,  
Cream rinse and tobacco smoke,  
That sickly scent is always, always there.


It's been a long time  
Since I've seen your smiling face  
It's been a long time  
Since I've seen a sunny day  
  
It's been a long time  
Since you wore your pillbox hat  
It's been a long time  
Since we drove your Pontiac  
  
It's been a long time  
Since you gave me butterflies  
It's been a long time  
Since I seen it burning in your eyes  
But I don't mind (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
When I've got you next to me  
  
It's been a long time  
Since we tripped into this ditch  
It's been a long time  
Since we drank the a-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-arsenic  
  
It's been a long time  
Since we've been inside of this tomb  
It's been a long time  
Since you wore your expensive French perfume  
But I don't mind (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
No I don't (I don't mind)  
When I've got you next to me  
  
It's been a long time  
Since I've seen your smiling face  
It's been a long time  
Since I've seen a sunny day


I am an opera singer  
i stand on painted tape  
It tells me where I'm going  
And where to throw my cape  
I call my co-stars brother  
I call my co-stars name  
I play both good and evil parts  
I sing to Verdi's grave  
  
And every single morning  
By 10 a.m I'm dressed  
My rehearsals last for hours and hours  
With diligence I have been blessed  
Some people, they call me monster  
Some people, they call me saint  
My talent feeds my darker side  
Yet no-one will complain  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
I've sung for Kings in Europe  
And Emperors in Japan  
  
And after each performance  
People stand around and wait  
Just to tell me that they loved my voice  
Just to tell me that I'm great  
I am an opera singer  
I will sing when you're all dead  
I sing the mountains crumbling apart  
I sing what can't be said  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
Most people seem to know my name  
Or at least know who I am


When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed it  
When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed  
The bricks and mortar  
Have all given way  
At first they resisted but then they began to sway  
How can you say forever is at your command  
How can you say the future's in the palm  
In the palm of your hand  
  
When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed it  
When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed  
That gaping hole was once a foundation  
Where you stand now were tools in the basement  
How can you say forever is at your command  
How can you say the future in the palm  
In the palm of your hand


Your pentagram is down below our floor.  
Your naked body shimmers in the night.  
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.  
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies  
Who have passed the test just like all the rest  
But never really understood the reasons why  
They took it in the first place.  
Ah in the first place.  
Your feisty eyes won't make me fall apart.  
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart.  
Yeah, dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.  
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night.  
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,  
But never really understood the reasons why  
I took it in the first place.  
Ah, in the first place.  
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,  
But never really understood the reasons why  
I took it in the first place.  
Ah, in the first place.


You won't admit you love me  
And so how am I ever to know?  
You always tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
A million times I ask you  
And then I ask you over again  
You always answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
If you can't make your mind up  
We'll never get started  
And I don't wanna wind up  
Being parted, broken hearted  
  
So if you really love me, say yes  
But if you don't, dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
If you can't make your mind up  
We'll never get started  
And I don't wanna wind up  
Being parted, broken hearted  
  
So if you really love me, say yes  
But if you don't, dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps


Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd float down to the sea  
  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd say just what you please  
Without the sticky little kitten  
Your ticket could never be free  
  
Without the tight little denim  
Your virtues would all go unknown  
Without the room that you live in  
Your cancer would eat to the bone  
  
Your muscles would bulge underground  
Your demons would all be around  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me  
  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd burn all these dying leaves  
  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd lift this steaming herd  
You would kill all the sick ones  
You would bury them deep in the earth  
  
Without the tight little denim  
Your virtues would all go unknown  
Without the room that you live in  
Your cancers would eat to the bone  
  
Your muscles would bulge underground  
Your demons would all be around  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me


The land of race car ya-yas  
The land where you can't change lanes  
The land where large fuzzy dice still hang proudly  
Like testicles from rear view mirrors  
The land of race car ya-yas  
The land where you can't change lanes  
The land where large fuzzy dice still hang proudly  
Like testicles from rear view mirrors  
The land of race car ya-yas, ya-yas  
Oh no, the land of race car ya-yas  
The land of race car ya-yas  
Race car ya-yas  


Well your CD collection looks shiny and costly.  
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?  
And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket?  
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket?  
  
Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs  
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.  
And how much did you pay for your rock'n'roll t shirt  
That proves you were there  
  
That you heard of them first?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
  
Ah, tell me.  
How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar,  
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?  
And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar,  
  
One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?  
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?  
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.  
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?  
  
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.  
Aging black leather and hospital bills,  
Tattoo removal and dozens of pills.  
Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments,  
  
But rock on completely with some brand new components.  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
  
Excess ain't rebellion.  
You're drinking what they're selling.  
Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them.  
Your chaos won't convert them.  
  
They're so happy to rebuild it.  
You'll never really kill it.  
Yeah, excess ain't rebellion.  
You're drinking what they're selling.  
  
Excess ain't rebellion.  
You're drinking,  
You're drinking,  
You're drinking what they're selling.


You've painted up your lips and rolled, and curled your tinted hair  
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?  
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down  
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town  
  
It wasn't me that started this whole crazy Asian war  
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore  
Yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be  
Oh Ruby, I still need some company  
  
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed  
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby, I realize  
But it won't be long, I've heard them say until I'm not around  
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town  
  
She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door  
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before  
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground  
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town  
Oh Ruby, for God sakes turn around


Do you think she's swimming in your lies?  
Do you think it's all just murky green?  
Don't you think that she would realize?  
Yeah do you think she has never seen?  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low  
When the waves retire to the darkness below  
I know I know Ruby sees all.  
I know I know Ruby sees.  
I can feel the pressure building high.  
You should see you're headed for a storm.  
Don't you see it building in the sky?  
Don't you think it's time to swim to shore?  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low,  
When the waves retire to the darkness below,  
I know, I know Ruby sees all.  
I know, I know Ruby sees all.  
I know, I know Ruby sees.


  
  
  
  
I'm writing a song all about you  
  
A true song as real as my tears  
  
But you've no need to fear it  
  
'Cause no one will hear it  
  
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year  
  
I'll tell all about how you cheated  
  
I'd like for the whole world to hear  
  
I'd like to get even  
  
With you 'cause you're leavin'  
  
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year  
  
It's a good thing that I'm not a star  
  
You don't know how lucky you are  
  
Though my record may say it  
  
No one will play it

I've got wheels of polished steel  
I've tires that grab the road  
I've got seats that selflessly hold my friends  
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads  
  
I've got a mind that can steer me to your house  
And a heart that can bring you red flowers  
My intentions are good and earnest and true  
But under my hood is internal combustion power  
And Satan is my motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is my motor. motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is the only one who seems to understand  
  
I've got brakes I'm wide awake  
I can stop this car at any time  
At the very last second I can change directions  
Turn completely around if I feel so inclined  
  
I've got a mind that can steer me to your house  
And a heart that can bring you red flowers  
My intentions are good and earnest and true  
But under my hood is internal combustion power

Hear my motor purr  
Satan is my motor, motor  
Hear my motor purr  
Satan is the only one who seems to understand  
  
Satan is my motor (x4)  
  
Satan is my motor  
Hear my motor purr  
  
Satan is my motor  
Satan is the only one who seems to understand


Adjectives on the typewriter  
He moves his words like a prize fighter  
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell  
  
The man on the street might just as well be

My heart can't forget about this self defense  
The air is so hot  
And my breath comes fast  
I thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last

I'm not feeling alright today  
I'm not feeling that great  
I'm not catching on fire today  
Love has started to fade  
I'm not going to smile today  
I'm not gonna laugh  
You're out living it up today  
I've got dues to pay  
  
And the gravedigger puts on the forceps  
The stonemason does all the work  
The barber can give you a haircut  
The carpenter can take you out to lunch  
  
Now I just want to play on my panpipes  
I just want to drink me some wine  
As soon as you're born you start dyin'  
So you might as well have a good time  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats...go to hell

Stickshifts and safetybelts  
Bucket seats have all got to go  
When we're driving in the car  
It makes my baby seem so far  
  
I need you here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
I need you to be here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
  
But when we're driving in my Malibu  
It?s easy to get right next to you  
I say, "Baby, scoot over, please"  
And then she's right there next to me  
  
I need you here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
I need you to be here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
  
Alright  
Well a lot of good cars are Japanese  
Yeah, but when we're driving far I need my baby  
I need my baby next to me  
  
Well, stickshifts and safetybelts  
Bucket seats have all got to go  
When we're driving in the car  
It makes my baby seem so far  
  
I need you here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
I need you to be here with me  
Not way over in a bucket seat  
  
Alright  
Alright


Strangers in the night, exchanging glances  
Wondering in the night what were the chances  
We'd be sharing love before the night was through  
  
Something in your eyes was so inviting  
Something in your smile was so exciting  
Something in my heart told me I must have you  
  
Strangers in the night, two lonely people  
We were strangers in the night  
Up to the moment when we said our first hello  
Little did we know, love was just a glance away  
A warm embracing dance away and  
  
Ever since that night, we've been together  
Lovers at first sight in love forever  
It turned out so right for strangers in the night  
  
Love was just a glance away  
A warm embracing dance away and  
  
Ever since that night, we've been together  
Lovers at first sight in love forever  
It turned out so right for strangers in the night


You keep pushing me away  
In spite of what you say  
I found out yesterday that I've  
Been wasting all my time  
  
Trying to make you smile  
Trying to make this seem worthwhile  
You've been pushing me around  
In spite of what I do  
Trying to make things good for you  
  
Take your economy car and your suitcase  
Take your psycho little dogs  
Take it all away  
  
You've been racing through my mind  
You're picking up in speed  
You're driving recklessly  
It's like a car crash happening on my street  
  
Broken bodies at my feet  
And sirens on the way  
  
They're too late  
'Cause nobody's going to save us  
We're a rubbernecker's dream  
We're burning gasoline  
  
Go  
Take your economy car and your suitcase  
Take your psycho little dogs  
Take it all away  
  
And go  
Go ahead and destroy this  
Better come with an army  
Are you feeling, feeling okay, baby?  
  
Uh huh  
Na na  
Na na, na na, na  
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na  
  
Take your economy car and your suitcase  
Take your psycho little dogs  
Take it all away


Reluctantly crouched at the starting line  
Engines pumping and thumping in time  
The green light flashes, the flags go up  
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup  
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank  
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank  
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns  
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern  
  
As they speed through the finish, the flags go down  
The fans get up and they get out of town  
The arena is empty except for one man  
Still driving and striving as fast as he can  
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up  
And long ago somebody left with the cup  
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns  
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns  
  
He's going the distance  
He's going for speed  
She's all alone  
In her time of need  
  
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course  
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse  
He's going the distance  
No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine  
He's haunted by something he cannot define  
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse  
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force  
In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade  
  
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade  
Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course  
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse  
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up  
And long ago somebody left with the cup  
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns  
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns  
  
'Cause he's going the distance  
He's going for speed  
She's all alone  
In her time of need  
  
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course  
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse  
He's racing and pacing and plotting the course  
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse  
  
He's going the distance  
He's going for speed  
He's going the distance


Who draws the crowd?  
Who plays so loud?  
Baby it's the guitar man  
Who's gonna steal the show  
You know baby it's the guitar man  
He can make you love he can make you cry  
He will bring you down he will get you high  
Something keeps him going  
Miles and miles away  
To find another place to play  
And night after night who treats you right  
Baby it's the guitar man  
Who's on the radio?  
You know baby it's the guitar man  
When he comes to town and you see his face  
And you think you might like to take his place  
Something keeps him drifting miles and miles away  
Searching for the songs to play  
Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along  
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song  
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own and take 'em
home  
  
He can make you love he can get you high  
He will bring you down he will make you cry  
Something keeps him moving  
But no one seems to know  
What it is that makes him go  
Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim  
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin  
But he never seems to notice he's just got to find another place to play  
(Fade away)  
(Got to play)  
(Fade away)


The house where you still live  
Walk on by  
The place where we would kiss  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by  
  
Walk on by  
The room where you still sleep  
Walk on by  
The company that you keep  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by  
  
Somehow I know whoa  
I won't forget you no no no no no, I won't  
You won't forget me no no no no no, you won't  
I'll keep on walking away from here  
I'll forget you when I reach the other side  
  
Walk on by  
The house where you still live  
Walk on by  
The place where we would kiss  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by  
  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by


I've been waiting  
For so long  
I've been hoping  
Your love's not gone  
Houses are sliding in the mud  
Rivers are raging in your blood  
Where would I be  
Without your love?  
Where would I be  
Without your arms around me?  
You were to be  
  
The only one  
If I knew you  
I would not run  
You have been  
Cloudy distant and dark  
I'm thinking of  
Noah and the ark  
Where would I be  
Without your love?  
Where would I be  
Without your arms around me?


I don't want to hear you whisper  
I don't want to orbit your world of two  
  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
  
I don't like to hang around you  
I don't want to live in your world of two  
  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
  
It's not that I don't like you  
But it's not that I don't love you  
It's not that I don't think you are  
Two of the most  
Perfectly  
Beautiful  
People in your world  
  
In your world of two  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
In your world of two  
There's only room  
There's only room  
There's only room  
For you


The same ones that I'm drowning in.  
You lead your casual slaughters  
And I'm the one who helps you win.  
You've got your grand piano.  
  
You don't even play piano.  
I'm the one who plays piano.  
You don't even play piano.  
You part the waters  
  
The same ones that I'm thirsty for.  
You invite your friends to tea  
But when it's me you lock the door.  
You've got your credit cards  
  
And you thank your lucky stars.  
But don't forget the ones who foot the bill.  
You've got your grand piano.  
And you don't even play piano.  
  
I'm the one who plays piano.  
You don't even play piano,  
But you part the waters.


ou turn the screws  
You tear down the bridge  
Flimsy as it is,  
It's business like.  
You shake my hand  
You break up the band  
Flimsy as it is,  
It's open mike  
punk rock  
Red white and blue,  
You twist the knife  
Then go home to kiss your wife  
A bigger better slice  
is what you'd like  
You kick the sand  
You get the upper hand  
You sell it to Japan  
It's natural  
Punk rock  
Red white and blue  
  
You turn the screws  
It's what you choose to do  
You think that I  
Must turn them too  
You think that I  
Must be so satisfied  
I stay inside  
I wonder why  
  
And the cement mixer gets it all ready  
One good turn at a time  
Then pouring it slowly and steady  
You're showing me where I can sign  
What I can expect to find  
But how you can you say you'll be happy  
When you turn the screws  
  
You turn the screws  
It's what you choose to do  
You think that I  
Must turn them too  
You think that I  
Must be so satisfied  
I stay inside  
I wonder why  
  
You turn the screws  
It's what you choose to do  
You think that I  
Must turn them too  
You think that I  
Must be so satisfied  
I stay inside  
I wonder why  


My love is like a red, red rose  
That's newly strung in June  
My love is like a melody  
That's sweetly played in tune  
  
As far art thou, my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still, my dear  
Til all the seas gang dry  
Til all the seas gang dry  
  
Till all the seas gang dry, my dear  
And the rocks melt with the sun  
I will love thee still, my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
  
And fare thee well, my only love  
And fare thee well a while  
And I will come again, my love  
Though it were ten thousand miles  
Though it were ten thousand miles


Some day I'm going to grow up  
And be every man's dream  
Some day I'm going to grow up  
And forget this sad little me  
I'm going to shine in the spotlight  
Wear sexy clothes  
Be somebody everybody wants to meet  
And no one ever really knows  
No one will ever know me  
  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
Critics will adore me  
At least they will at first  
But you see I already know this  
So it can't never really hurt  
And if it does, I'm an actress  
I'll play it nonchalant  
In the total scheme of things it's insignificant  
(Sure I can take the knocks)  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
I may not be that pretty now  
But who's the referee  
Standards of beauty  
Will be redefined because of me  
  
And then they'll be the scandals  
Everywhere my name  
Men will jump from balconies  
And I'll just shrug and take the blame  
(Yeah, they'll say I died for love)  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Well, I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
My acceptance speech will be a milestone  
Never will such a star  
Have ever graced the microphone  
And of course I'll thank my agent  
The way they always do  
Though I could have done it without him  
And that goes for the Academy too  
And the makeup people and the lighting designers and everybody else  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I'll be gracious to the lesser stars  
And generous to the unknowns  
And if another actress threatens  
My position on the throne  
  
Well, I don't know exactly what I'll do  
I don't exactly know  
But I know that it could turn into  
One of my most poignant roles  
Everyone will have their handkerchiefs out  
And they'll have to leave the theater early  
And then they'll go home  
And what'll they do?  
They'll have a big glass of alcohol  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
And if I make it to the top I won't be overthrown  
I'm an actress ah, yeah, yeah


Heat's up, tea's brewed  
Clothes strewn around the room  
Looks like a wind swept through  
Made a wild man out of you  
And doesn't anger turn you on  
And expectation of a calm  
After the storm  
And your body feels so warm  
After the storm  
  
The wind's pulling the moon down  
under the eiderdown  
You're taking me to town  
And you're tossing me around  
You come on like a hurricane  
I'm settling like you're weathervane  
After the storm  
And your body feels so warm  
After the storm


What do the neighbors say  
When they hear us scream at night  
Do they talk about a love all in tatters  
What do the neighbors know  
About the heart and soul  
The fire down below that really matters  
They can never guess in the silences  
That all I want is you  
And the sexy hurricane we got here, oh, babe  
  
All I want is you  
I don't want a man who says "Good morning, dear", no, I don't  
(All I want is you, all that I want is you)  
(All I want is you, nobody else, no one but you)  
  
Let 'em listen at the door  
Let 'em listen through the floor  
Let 'em go ahead and draw the wrong conclusion  
So chase me 'round the room  
Make me crazy like the moon  
They can never guess in the silences  
And all I want is you  
And the sexy hurricane that we share (We share, yeah)  
  
All I want is you  
I don't want a man who tiptoes up the stairs, no, I don't  
(All I want is you, all that I want is you)  
(All I want is you, nobody else, no one but you)  
  
They can never guess in the silences  
That all I want is you (All I want is you)  
And the sexy hurricane that we share, oh uh oh  
  
All I want is you  
I don't want a man who tiptoes up the stairs (He's gonna fall)  
All I want is you  
And your freight train  
Whistlin' over my track, oh uh oh  
All I want is you  
And your Mack truck loving  
Jumping me, Jack  
Oh uh oh, Jack  
  
(All that I want)


Jake  
I know your face  
So well  
Close my eyes  
And see it still  
Though time can turn  
A heart to stone  
Your face will stay  
A face I've known  
  
Jake  
Some things  
Still hurt and how  
And God  
It's hard  
To see you now  
Because you  
My life a hell  
And Jake  
I know your face  
So well  
  
And it was always  
All right there  
Why didn't you know  
It was all right there  
Why couldn't I show you  
It was always there  
  
All the love  
In the world  
All the love  
All the love  
In the world


Time and again I've longed for adventure,  
Something to make my heart beat the faster.  
What did I long for? I never really knew.  
Finding your love I've found my adventure,  
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,  
All that I want in all of this world is you.  
  
You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long.  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.  
You are the angel glow that lights a star,  
The dearest things I know are what you are.  
Some day my happy arms will hold you,  
And some day I'll know that moment divine,  
When all the things you are, are mine!  
  


(Lord Burgess)  
  
Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
But when I reached Jamaica I made her stop  
  
Now I'm sad to say  
I'm on my way (on my way)  
I won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the dancing girls sway to and fro  
I must declare my heart is there  
Though I have been from Maine to Mexico  
  
Still I'm sad to say  
I'm on my way (on my way)  
I won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Down at the market you can hear  
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear  
Ackev rice, salt fish are nice  
Oh the rum is fine anytime of year  
  
Now I'm sad to say  
I'm on my way (on my way)  
I won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
But when I reached Jamaica I made her stop  
  
Now I'm sad to say  
I'm on my way (on my way)  
I won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town


Are you ticklish  
Or did I just hit a funny bone  
Are you ticklish  
Are we really alone?  
  
Do you like me  
Or am I just hoping for too much  
Do you like me  
Do you like to touch  
Do you like me  
  
I hear there's another side to you  
Well there's another side to me too  
Let's get over to the other side  
Real soon  
  
I hear there's an underneath to you  
Well there's an underneath to me too  
Let's get down underneath  
Real soon  
  
Are you lonesome  
Well everybody's lonesome  
So it's safe to assume you're lonesome  
But are you ticklish  
Are you ticklish


You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say I love you  
On that you can rely  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and lovesongs never out of date  
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
It's still the same old story  
The fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by


Back the way it was before  
Before the heart was broken  
Playing hookey, making cookies  
We were always jokin'  
Back the way it used to be  
Talks didn't end in a quarrel  
Everything seemed so normal  
Back the way it was before  
  
But now the limo pulls up to the door  
And she gets in  
She calls bye, bye honey  
Here is some money  
I forgot the groceries  
  
Back the way it was before  
The chicken pox was easy  
We told each other everything  
And nobody was nosey  
Back the way it used to be  
When we were a happy family  
Nobody ever asked us  
If we wanted tiny little sandwiches  
Sent up to our room


Better not tell her, that I was your lover  
Better not make her jealous of me  
Better convince her there was nothing between us  
I'm not those initials in your diary  
But if you slip and my name comes up  
Don't deny that you knew me  
Just leave out the white nights  
The moon in your window  
The break in your whisper  
The promises after  
  
Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing  
Don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in Madrid  
Let it all go now, Like smoke from a candle  
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind  
But if you slip and my name comes up  
Don't deny that you knew me  
Just leave out the white nights  
The moon in your window  
The break in your whisper  
The promises after  
Leave out the tears and the laughter  
She won't need to know  
That I cried when you left  
That I think of you still  
  
But if you slip and my name comes up  
Don't deny that you knew me  
Just leave out the white nights  
The moon in your window  
The break in your whisper  
The promises after  
Leave out the tears and the laughter  
She won't need to know  
That I'd die for your love  
That I still love you


The blue of blue  
Is mostly grey  
Ain't no silver line  
No brighter day  
Last of the coming up  
Didn't come my way  
Looks like I'm down here to stay  
Down to stay  
  
So kick me, I won't feel a thing  
My senses have all been run  
And there's nothing left of the used to be  
But the weeping that's just begun  
That sour taste too late  
But now I duck my head  
And no cradle rocks this empty bed  
If crying's not good for me  
Then I guess I'm doing wrong  
So I sing this crying song  
Cry along  
  
You packed it in too soon  
You lose me but not your nerve  
Well I guess I know it's what I deserve  
Crazy to think that I could keep you on reserve  
And so the curtain falls  
Curtain falls


I've been saying that I'd  
Leave well enough alone  
Now I'm behaving  
Like I'm begging you for a bone  
When it feels good you can't help it  
You just hang by the phone  
And it felt that good last night  
I can't give it up  
  
You come on like a prince  
You got everyone convinced  
That you're a prince of a man  
But I'm the one who knows you  
I'm the one you show that you  
Don't give a damn  
Can't give it up, oh no, can't give it up  
  
I've been dreaming you'd fall in love with me  
No cold blooded scheming  
If it could be that easy  
But you still fight it  
And I must like it  
That I have to reach for what I want  
And as long as it feels that good  
I can't give it up  
  
I don't want to want you  
I don't want to want you  
'Cause you can't give, can't give  
No, I don't want you cause you  
Can't give


Hey, when I say things that bother you  
Don't be a stubborn man  
Don't leave me in the cold  
Remember who I am  
Damn, you get to me  
When I can't get to you,  
No fair, you're silent and you're hurt  
And all I want to do  
Is know what I've done wrong  
All I want to know is what to do  
Damn, you get to me  
When I can't get to you  
There's too much long distance  
In our love  
And tonight I need you  
Don't run away, please let me know  
How I've hurt you  
Hey, it's me, see I'm the lucky one  
You've opened up my heart  
You led me by the hand  
You took me slow so I would understand  
Damn, you got to me  
Let me get to you  


I said that I felt jailed up  
As if our doors were nailed up  
I said I needed separate places,  
Parties, room to move around in.  
I said I needed my fling  
Had to get out and do some other thing.  
It took me months to calculate  
That I had nothing left without you-  
  
[Chorus]  
Dan, my fling is all flung out  
Now I've got to fall back on dreams  
  
I thought I'd try and write you  
I thought I'd try and phone you  
I thought I'd try to tell you  
That I smell your hair still on my pillow  
But you'd just mile to please me  
You'd shake your head, you'd tease me -  
Remind me it was I who first claimed  
That we both required freedom  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd dream up schemes to meet you,  
I'd nonchalantly greet you,  
I'd ask you up for coffee  
Anytime you had an hour open.  
You say you like my hair long,  
You ask me if I've written any new songs,  
You'd laugh, you'd turn and cross the street  
And leave me dizzy with your laughter -  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear you're leaving this town,  
You and some girl gonna travel around,  
You bought a car with foldback seats,  
you'll camp out by the lakes and forests.  
I lie alone in our old bed,  
Your laughter it's echoin' inside my head.  
I close my eyes, I smell your hair  
It's like I haven't slept in years -  
  
[Chorus]


Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.  
  
But come you back when summer's in the meadow  
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow  
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
But when you come, when all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead, as dead I well may be  
Then if you bend and tell me that you love me  
I'll sleep in peace until you come to me  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow  
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.


Davy, is there a song out there in the night  
For us?  
Davy, is there the kind of smile that you  
Read about?  
There are ghosts who would warn me  
Keep me alone  
Davy, are you the heat I feel in my  
Foolish heart?  
Davy, there's not a day that I haven't prayed  
To feel something so worthy  
For someone like you  
  
Davy, could there be love so bright  
Like to jump off the sea?  
Davy, did I imagine it or did you look at me  
With a look so bold that I had to look away?  
  
But if it feels alright  
If it feels alright and it feels alright  
Davy, Davy, Davy!


I'm the most dangerous person in this room  
The way you look  
I could do some damage to myself  
It's your heart against mine  
And I fear I may capsize  
I'm operating without a license  
But I'm willing to pay the price  
'Cause you're just so easy  
You're so damned easy on the eyes  
  
You turn your face  
The two sides don't synchronize  
You're nothing like anyone I've ever seen before  
If I'm staring at you then I apologize  
You defy every rule I've learned  
But still I've never been half so turned on  
And you're just so easy  
You're so damned easy on the eyes  
  
Handsome's not a word that comes to mind  
But I'd have to be blind to try and minimize  
How easy you are on the eyes  
Easy on the eyes  
In my vertigo  
You're easy on the eyes  
From head to toe  
You're so easy on the eyes  
  
I'm operating without a license  
But I'm willing to pay the price  
And you're just so easy  
You're just so damn easy on the eyes


Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Doesn't like to hear the baby cry  
Doesn't like to about the aches and pains  
Of the day gone by  
Of the day gone by  
  
But the mother advertised as a bargain wife  
She'd make things easy for the rest of his life  
And to make herself more appealing  
She'd think only of him and forget her own feelings  
  
Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Wants his wife to be the truckdriver  
Wants his wife to be the gardener  
And still look like a Hollywood Starlet  
And still look like a Hollywood Starlet  
  
So the mother gets mad and she leaves town  
That brings the father and the baby down  
She wants the father to find her  
Drinkin' orange pop in the seedy Greek diner  
  
Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Gets her back and gets up in the night  
Loves her so much and holds the baby tight  
Ain't that enough to make you cry  
Ain't that enough to make you cry  
  
Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Doesn't like to hear the baby cry  
Doesn't like to know about the aches and pains  
Of the day gone by  
Of the day gone by


In a pine forest cooler than the rest of the island  
Lives a young fisherman with eyes like the sea  
He built his own boat and made his own cabin  
but he's broken the hearts of the likes like me  
  
Now you must understand he made me a promise  
there were secrets we shared we planted a tree  
We lived in a cabin, I fished along side of him  
I fell under the spell of his sorcery  
  
When he cast me adrift at the end of the summer  
It was not for another but his own privacy  
I fell apart like a rose, but the scent of my longing  
Remains and it weeps like an old willow tree  
  
At night when it's still, with a yellow moon rising  
When his candle is snuffed and he's deep in a dream  
I move like a cat, and crawl into his window  
And lie down beside him in a golden moonbeam  
  
The smell of his skin is just like the summer  
When our love was as fresh as the grass in the fields  
And ever so softly I kiss his eyelids  
Before slipping away, my secret concealed  
  
Though I'm in it alone, I'm still in it, In love  
And love can be lonely like a sweet melody  
But just maybe he feels like a whisper inside him  
Like an angel beside him, keeping him company


I have no need of half of anything  
No half time, no half of a man's attention  
Give me all the earth and sky  
And at the same time add a new dimension  
Half the truth is of no use  
Give it all, give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Give me all night  
Give me the full moon  
And if I can't take the whole of you  
Give it to me anyway  
Give me all night  
'Till the last star fades  
And if you can't take my heart and soul  
Take it from me anyway  
  
Don't give me fountains, I need waterfalls  
And, when I cry my tears'll fill an ocean  
The pain of love I'll accept it all  
As long as you'll join me in that emotion  
Half of lovin' is no fun  
Give it all, give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Don't leave me guessing alone  
Don't walk me half the way home  
You can do that tomorrow  
Just give me give me all night.


I stood in the doorway in my white nightgown  
Red roses on cotton, I stood three feet from the ground  
the grownups inside used words I didn't know  
But still I enjoyed the show  
  
They looked so lovely, they looked so self-assured  
And I just like them would know it all when I matured  
And I wouldn't be afraid of the darkness or the bears  
Or the cracks in the ceiling upstairs  
  
Now I've just gotten older, I've just gotten taller  
And the little ones, they call me a grownup  
  
Lat night at a friend's house a little girl was there  
She stood in the doorway playing with her hair  
She looked up to me as if I could do no wrong  
As I got up to sing my song  
  
I sang it with a shiver in my throat and in my knees  
Feeling just as small as a thistle in a breeze  
But the child's imagination carried me along  
And saw me through my song  
  
Now I've just gotten older, I've just gotten taller  
And the little ones call me a grownup


You said we'd light the firmament  
You said our love was permanent  
You said we'd stick through thick and thin  
Through up and down, through lose and win  
But comes the first sign of stormy weather  
You're packin' your bags in the trance  
But you gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance  
  
you can't pretend it's Camelot  
Then start to run when things get hot  
When love explodes there's always heat  
There's always bitter with the sweet  
There's always times when your legs feel broken  
But you still don't drop out of the dance  
You gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance


There goes my young intended  
The thing has ended  
Regrets are vain  
I'll never find another half so sweet  
And we'll never meet again  
I got impatient  
Told him goodbye  
Sad eyes out in the rain  
  
He was too good to me  
How can I get along now  
So close he stood to me  
Everything seems all wrong now  
He would have brought me the sun  
Making me smile, that was his fun  
  
When I was mean to him  
He'd never say go away now  
I was a Queen to him  
Who's gonna make me gay now  
It's only natural that I'm blue  
He was too good to be true


I can almost touch the stars  
Filling up the night  
On their way around the world  
They stop their flight  
  
I can see the brightest star  
Dazzling in the west  
Three wise men follow  
With no time for rest  
  
And heaven can't be far  
From where we lie  
Heaven can't be far  
From where we lie  
  
Follow, follow  
Pilgrims follow  
To see the carpenters' child  
Born the king of angels  
He is meek and mild  
Son of Joseph  
Son of Mary  
Son of love  
He is born  
Son of all believers  
On this Christmas morn  
  
And heaven can't be far  
From where we lie  
Heaven can't be far  
From where we lie


Oh my boy, what have you done?  
Did you go out surfing on a frozen sea?  
Did you scare the livin' daylights out of me?  
  
Did you go too far to drive away the demons?  
Did you go too far to know what love really means?  
Did you imagine it was more cause she went away first  
Or did you force her hand to renew your thirst?  
  
[Chorus]  
Well if you ever want an endless night  
Or you need a moon and stars to shine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you some of mine  
  
Oh my girl, what have you done?  
Is it something we can't even talk about?  
Did you silence me, remove me from your faith?  
  
Did you make me all but a stranger to your love?  
Did you look right through me  
Below me and above?  
Did you try to ignore me, make me all but lost?  
Did you cloud up the sky when you needed me most?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be fine  
It's gonna be fine, just fine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you all of mine


You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you've got  
You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you've got  
  
'Cause if you think  
Nobody else wants it  
Just throw it away  
And you will see  
Somebody else will have it  
Before you can count 1-2-3  
  
You take love for granted  
And it's gone like a bandit  
And this loneliness cuts like a knife  
  
When you see what you've lost  
It's already cost  
The one you could love your whole life


Everyone knows  
What a Heffalump's like  
It's got fiery eyes  
And a tail with a spike  
With claws on it's paws  
That are sharp as a tack  
And wing-a-ma-things  
Coming out of it's back  
  
Excuse me  
What's a Heffalump?  
  
Everyone knows  
What a Heffalump's like  
It's got fiery eyes  
And a tail with a spike  
With claws on it's paws  
That are sharp as a tack  
And wing-a-ma-things  
Coming out of it's back


I love you more than the first sunset  
The first star I saw I would surely bet  
So how could you ever, could you ever forget?  
  
You're here but you're gone  
It's in your eyes  
Somethings gone wrong  
You've stifled your cries  
You can't expect that I'll ever forget  
  
All the details of your mind you would tell me through the night  
After we'd made love and the way was so open  
Now you turn your back to me  
As if we'd never spoken  
  
But I still love you more than the first sunset  
I swear I caught a shooting star the first time we met  
So how could you ever  
I know that I'll never  
How could you ever, ever forget?


I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years?  
Little wow, tell me now  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
There were chills up my spine  
And some thrills I can't define  
Listen sweet, I repeat  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
Oh, I feel that I could melt  
Into heaven I'm hurled  
I know how Columbus felt  
Finding another world  
  
Kiss me once, then once more  
What a dunce I was before  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been goin' on?


I heard the bells on Christmas day  
Their old familiar carols play  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
  
I thought how as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth, good will to men  
  
And in despair I bowed my head  
"There is no peace on earth," I said  
"For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth  
Peace on earth"


I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
Tables of paper wood  
Windows of light  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A simple garden, with acres of sky  
A brown-haired dogmouse  
If one should drop by  
Yellow delanie would sleep well at night  
And everything emptying into white  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  
A black spider dancing on top of his eye  
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike  
And everything emptying into white


(Bob Marley)  
I want to love you  
And treat you right  
I want to love you  
Every day and every night  
We'll be together with a roof  
Right over our head  
We'll share the shelter of my single bed  
We'll share the same room,  
God will provide the bread  
  
Chorus:  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling  
I'm willing and able  
So I throw my cards on the table  
  
I want to love you  
And treat you right  
I want to love you  
Everyday and every night  
We'll be together with a roof  
Right over our heads  
We'll share the shelter of my single bed  
We'll share the same room  
God will provide the bread  
  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling I want to know, want to know, want to know now  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to love you  
I want to treat you right  
I want to love you  
Everyday and every night  
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads  
We'll share the shelter, yeah, of my single bed  
We'll share the same room  
God will provide the bread


I'm an island  
Everyone can see that I'm an island  
I've got ocean just about everywhere that I can see  
And I'll be stranded unless you come to me  
And I'm lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
I would rather fall from grace completely  
Than let you change my mind  
And I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun  
  
Can't be too careful bout the friends you keep around you  
Some who never let you down  
Some who fail you every day  
And it's a blatant disrespect of privacy  
It amazes me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm an island  
Can't you understand me?  
I'm an island?  
And I'm finally by myself, the way I've got to be  
And that's exactly the thing that's been killing me  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
The rising...


[Chorus]  
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout  
Down came the rain and washed the spider out  
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain  
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again  
  
I believe in love  
And who knows where or when  
Bit it's comin' around again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know nothin' stays the same  
But if you're willing to play the game  
It's comin' around again  
  
[Chorus]


You came smilin' softly, shyly movin'  
Easy as a dreamer into my room  
And before I realized the danger  
I found myself looking into your eyes  
Somewhere in their colors I saw promises  
Of things I'd never seen before  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
  
Holding onto, talking, saying nothing  
Knowing in a moment I could lose you  
Then without a warning I remembered that  
You trembled at the touch of my hand  
Knowing when you came to me that no one else  
Would ever feel the same in my arms  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
  
Wakin' in the morning to the tenderness  
Of holding you asleep in my arms  
Dreaming while my hair was blowing  
Softer than a whisper on my cheek  
I don't know the feeling so I don't know if it's love  
But it's enough  
It's enough  
I can't help it  
I've got to have you  
It's all over  
I've got to have you


I've got you under my skin  
I've got you deep in the heart of me  
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd tried so not to give in  
I said to myself this affair never will go so well  
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well  
That I've got you under my skin?  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of havin' you near  
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night  
And repeats and repeats in my ear  
  
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?  
Use your mentality, wake up to reality  
But each time that I do just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of havin' you near  
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night  
And repeats, how it yells in my ear  
  
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?  
Why not use your mentality, wake up to reality?  
But each time that I do just the thought of you  
Makes me stop just before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin  
  
'Cause I've got you under my skin  
Yeah, I've got you under my skin  
Sure enough I do, baby  
Sure enough I do


James,  
Your voice is like the water  
When I lift this shell to my ear  
I can hear you pourin' out your heart to me  
James,  
The beauty of your voice  
Lifts us from sadness  
James,  
Let us become like water together  
Sing to me  
Sit on the edge of my bed as when we  
First spent nights together  
Your body wrapped around your guitar  
Let the music speak for your heart  
Let them combine like water and sand  
Let them meet the air like drops of rain  
And bring us together, once again


Oh mother, say a prayer for me  
Jesse's back in town, it won't be easy  
Don't let him near me  
Don't let him touch me  
Don't let him please me  
  
(chorus)  
Jesse, I won't cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse, I won't make the wine cold for you  
Jesse, I won't change the sheets for you  
I won't put on cologne  
I won't sit by the phone for you  
  
Annie, keep reminding me  
That he cut out my heart like a paper doll  
Sally, tell me once again  
How he set me up just to see me fall  
  
Chorus  
  
Jesse, quick come here  
I won't tell a soul  
Not even myself  
Jesse, that you've come back to me  
My friends will all say "She's gone again'  
But how can anyone know what you are to me  
That I'm in heave again because you've come back to me - Oh Jessie!  
  
Jesse, I'll always cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse, I'll always make the wine cold for you  
Jesse, I can easily change my mind about you  
And put on cologne  
And sit by the phone for you  
  
Jesse, let's open the wine  
And drink to the heart  
Which has a will of it's own  
My friends, let's comfort them  
They're feeling bad  
They think I've sunk so low  
  
Jesse, I'll always cut fresh flowers for you  
Jesse, I'll always make the wine cold for you  
Jesse, I will change the sheets for you  
Put on cologne  
And I will wait by the phone for you - Oh Jesse


Julie through the glass  
Lookin' up at me  
You've just got to be  
The sweetest thing I've ever seen.  
  
Julie through the glass  
Just born a day ago  
And who knows where you've been  
And where you're gonna go.  
  
We want you to love the world  
To know it well and play a part  
And we'll help you to learn to love yourself  
'Cause that's where loving really starts.  
  
Julie through the glass  
I'm looking forward to  
Doing things with you  
For many years to come.


Today I was gonna conquer the world,  
Go on ahead and make a stand.  
Today I saw an old friend a dyin'  
And as he lay there no one lent a hand,  
I'm gonna call you up,  
You'll forsake the one you love,  
Though I've left you many times before  
You are just a sinner.  
  
I was the one who understands,  
You were my one and only man.  
I was lost, now I'm the winner.  
You stand there waitin' by the shore,  
But I don't come that way no more,  
Because you are just a sinner.  
  
Today I was gonna hold out my hand,  
Reach up for that light and let it shine.  
Today I have no light to guide me  
Feelin' like the one they left behind,  
So I called you up,  
You left your love and took me away,  
Though I've left you many times before  
You are just a sinner.  
  
I am the only one, you see,  
You were the only one for me,  
I was lost, now I'm the winner.  
You'll keep the candle burning bright,  
But I won't be home tonight,  
Because you are just a sinner.  
  
Today I was gonna conquer the world,  
Go on ahead and make a stand.  
Today I saw an old friend a dyin',  
And as he lay there, no one lent a hand.


If you think you're alone  
that you're the only one who is afraid  
Let me tell you, I feel just like you do  
And sometimes I stand back  
From desires and dreams I don't understand  
They overwhelm me  
I feel just like you do  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel just like you do  
I feel just like you do  
Just like you do  
Just like you do  
I feel just like you do  
Just like you do  
I feel just like you do  
  
And when it comes to love  
You want me to be the one to say  
The words: I love you  
But I feel just like you do  
But let's try to return  
To that brave innocence we once knew  
I wish you were an ocean  
So I could jump into you  
  
[Chorus]


You stick to me when I wish you gone  
You hammer on my thoughts through dreams  
Your plot is thick with saucy schemes  
And ways to reach my balconies  
But I say I'm not turned on by the way you look  
I say I'm not turned on by the way you act  
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you need me  
But sometimes, just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know, It's just not true  
  
You're in my blood, a Holy Ghost  
I scream, but it's a hollow plea  
The thoughts I swallow leave me thirsty  
You do a very fine imitation of me  
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you laugh  
I'm not turned on by the way you smile  
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you love me  
But sometimes, just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know, it's just not true  
  
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you dance  
I'm not turned on my the way you laugh  
I'm not turned on when you need me  
But sometimes, just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know, it's just not true.


Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let is snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear we're still goodbye-ing  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let snow, let it snow  
  
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
Oh the lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Oh, let it snow  
  
All the way home I'll be warm  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear I'm still goodbye-ing  
As long you love me so  
  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let is snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
Let the river run,  
let all the dreamers  
wake the nation.  
Come, the New Jerusalem.  
  
Silver cities rise,  
the morning lights  
the streets that meet them,  
and sirens call them on  
with a song.  
  
It's asking for the taking.  
Trembling, shaking.  
Oh, my heart is aching.  
  
We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
We the great and small  
stand on a star  
and blaze a trail of desire  
through the dark'ning dawn.  
  
It's asking for the taking.  
Come run with me now,  
the sky is the color of blue  
you've never even seen  
in the eyes of your lover.  
  
Oh, my heart is aching.  
We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
[guitar]  
  
It's asking for the taking.  
Trembling, shaking.  
Oh, my heart is aching.  
We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
Let the river run,  
let all the dreamers  
wake the nation.  
Come, the New Jerusalem.  
  
  


In a suitcase tied with string  
On the highest shelf  
In the closet down the hall  
Hidden from myself  
Fits of madness, pools of grief  
Fevers of desire  
How peculiar these remain  
Salvaged from the fire  
For some I crumpled some I burned  
Some I tore to shreds  
Lifetimes later, here they are  
Ones I saved instead  
Letters never sent to you  
Letters never sent  
  
Never reached their destination  
Mostly born of pain  
Resurfaced with the purpose of  
A trip down memory lane  
  
Broken hearted, breaking hearts  
All the way it went  
Evidence of what I saw  
My experiments  
  
Life's a riddle, life's a dream  
Life's an accident  
Now I'm gonna set them free  
Letters never sent  
  
Letters never sent to you  
Letters never sent  
Once upon a time taboo  
Letters never sent  
  
Letters never sent to you  
Letters never sent  
Incongruous, and overdue  
Letters never sent


If all our flights are grounded  
Libby, we'll meet in Paris  
Dance along the boulevards  
And have no one to embarrass,  
Puttin' on the Ritz in style  
With an Arab and an Heiress,  
Libby we'll fly away - hey  
Leave behind our blues  
Trade them all in  
For a Paris breeze.  
Libby we'll fly  
  
See how dark the circles grow  
In a town that has no light  
So many eyes just staring out  
Into the bloodshot night  
And Libby, I hate you to cry, and I  
Want to share it all with you,  
And if it brings us to our knees  
We'll trade it all in for a Paris breeze.  
Libby we'll fly.  
  
They say it don't come easy  
They say that love is blind  
And if you're afraid to be close  
Then love is hard to find  
And if you spend too much time winning love  
There's no time to be kind  
And Libby, I'm guilty of your crimes,  
I'm just another passenger.  
Travelling on these crazy high seas  
Very likely be the same  
In a Paris breeze,  
Libby we'll fly  
  
If all our flights are grounded,  
Libby, we'll go to Paris  
And wish we were back home again  
Or sailing on the ocean  
Just a window and a drink  
To set our dreams in motion  
But Libby, we'll fly anyway, hey  
And leave behind our blues  
Half sung melodies  
Trade them all in for a Paris breeze,  
Libby we'll fly.


I've been doing a lot of thinking  
About growing older and moving on  
Nobody wants to be told that they're getting on  
For a long, long stay  
But just how long and who knows  
And how and where my spirit will go  
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone  
Or evaporate on a breeze  
Won't you tell me please  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight  
  
Here on earth I'm a lost soul  
Ever trying to find my way back home  
Maybe that's why each new star is born  
Expanding heaven's room  
Eternity in bloom  
And will I see you up in that heaven  
In all it's light will I know you're there  
Will we say the things that we never dared  
If wishing makes it so  
Won't you let me know  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight


Dear mother the struggle is over now  
And your house is up for sale  
We divided your railway watches  
Between the four of us  
I fought over the pearls  
With the other girls  
But it was all a metaphor  
For what was wrong with us  
As the room is emptying out  
Your face so young comes into view  
And on the back porch is a well-worn step  
And a pool of light you can walk into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you, forever  
Like a river  
  
Can you clear up the mystery of the Sphinx?  
Do you know any more about God?  
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin  
On the face of the moon?  
Have you reconciled with Dad?  
Does the rain still make you sad?  
Last night I swear I could feel you  
Moving through my room  
And I thought you touched my feet  
I so wanted it to be true  
In my theater there is a stage  
And a footlight you can step into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you, forever  
Like a river  
  
In the river I know I will find the key  
And your voice will rise like the spray  
In the moment of knowing  
The tide will wash away my doubt  
'Cause you're already home  
Making it nice for when I come home  
Like the way I find my bed turned down  
Coming in from a late night out.  
Please keep reminding me  
Of what in my soul I know is true  
  
Come in my boat, there's a seat beside me  
And two or three stars we can gaze into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you forever  
Like a river  
  
I'll never leave, always just a dream away  
A star that's always watching  
Never turn away  
We'll never leave, always just a thought away  
A candle always burning  
Never turn away  
The moon will hide, the tree will bend  
I'm right beside you  
I'll never turn away


Make me feel something  
I used to feel  
I used to feel something for you  
But I've been sleep walking  
Stumbling in false starts, fumbling into false hearts  
Tumbling into false hearts, mainly mine  
  
Make me feel something  
Feel something  
Can it be I'm growing old  
Feel something  
Maybe I'm just too controlled  
Feel something  
I'm much too young to feel this old  
  
make me walk on air  
I used to dare  
I used to take chances for you  
But now I'm longing to feel passion  
'Cause I've only been pretending  
Acting out the drama  
Dying for a happy end  
Just to feel alive  
  
I don't want to say "I love you"  
To one more fantasy  
You'd never believe  
What a good actress I could be  
  
Remember when  
We were fresh in love  
Your eyes were pale like the moon  
We'd sit on the porch in Summer  
Listen to the breezes  
Spinning melodies  
I dressed you up like a god  
The one you were


My love is like a red, red rose  
That's newly strung in June  
My love is like a melody  
That's sweetly played in tune  
  
As far art thou, my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still, my dear  
Til all the seas gang dry  
Til all the seas gang dry  
  
Till all the seas gang dry, my dear  
And the rocks melt with the sun  
I will love thee still, my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
  
And fare thee well, my only love  
And fare thee well a while  
And I will come again, my love  
Though it were ten thousand miles  
Though it were ten thousand miles


O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem  
  
O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem  
  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
Sing, choirs of angels  
Sing in exhalation  
O sing all ye citizens of Heav'n above  
  
Glory to God  
Glory in the Highest  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee  
Born this happy morning  
Oh Jesus, to Thee be a glory giv'n  
  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
Christ, The Lord  
  
O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant


Well it's plain as rain  
And it's there for all the world to see  
Just 'cause everybody does it  
That doesn't make it right for me  
Someone is making plans  
Involvin' my old man  
Everytime I turn by back around  
Feelin' like a one man woman  
Living in a two time town  
  
Now the place I come from  
People don't grow on trees  
And you can't treat people like meat  
Without getting brought to your knees  
Now and then  
The way I've been feeling  
Since I hit this town  
Like to jump in the river and drown  
Feeling like a one man woman  
Living in a two time town  
  
Sometimes I'd like  
To get out on the floor  
Shake it till dawn  
Some young thing  
Like to teach him the bump  
Make me want to take him home  
Well excuse me  
I don't mean to preach no lectures  
Yeah but me and my man won't  
Be able to stay for breakfast  
I guess he's got the itch  
And I'm just a bitch  
Who's trying to bring him down  
  
Feeling like a one man woman  
Acting like a one man woman  
I guess I'm just a one man woman


Orpheus, it could have been  
You could have held me again  
You said your songs had all gone  
And that the road back up was too long  
But it was there for us  
It was there for us  
I loved you all along  
  
Orpheus  
The part of me that died  
Was ready to be reborn  
And you called of the hounds  
Of hell with your songs  
Orpheus, Orpheus  
I loved you all along, Orpheus  
  
Orpheus, It could have been  
You could have held me again  
But you couldn't wait  
Somewhere along the road  
You lost your faith  
Out of despair and believing  
I was gone  
You gave up on my love  
You gave up on us  
  
But it was there for us,  
It was there for us  
I loved you all along  
Orpheus


Our first day together  
Was after we'd been close in dreams  
Was after we'd shared hell and heaven  
And all the places in-between  
And all the places in-between  
  
After we'd spent nights together  
And breathed secrets without words  
After we'd made promises  
That could but might not have been heard  
Might not have been heard  
  
Knowing me the way you do  
Then why did you just say  
That our first day together  
Was today?


We lived up here in Cambridge  
And browsed in the hippest newsstands  
The we started our own newspaper  
Gave the truth about Uncle Sam  
We loved to be so radical  
But like a ragged love affair  
Some became disenchanted  
And some of us just got scared  
  
Now are you playing possum  
Keeping a low profile  
Are you playing possum for a while  
  
Then you moved to the country  
Bought a farm and tilled the land  
Then you took your books to India  
And got hooked on a holy man  
But the wells they do run dry  
And the speeches turn to words  
And the woods are full of tigers  
And freedom's for the birds  
  
Now you run a bookstore  
And you've taken on a wife  
You wear patches on your elbows  
And you live an easy life  
But are you finally satisfied  
Is it what you were lookin' for  
Or does it sneak up on you  
That there might be something more


I can barely see your sneakers  
You say I got to keep my head down  
You're painting my portrait  
In a red velvet gown  
  
How do you see me  
As demure and discreet?  
But do you know what I'll do  
Do you know what I'll do  
When I go out on the street?  
  
Pure sin, pure sin  
The kind you won't mind  
The kind there could be trouble in  
  
I can barely see your sneakers  
You know they look pretty rough  
Well I bet when you get loaded  
You can get pretty tough  
  
You pass me the caviar  
Say "Hey baby do you want something to eat?"  
But do you know what I'll do  
Do you know what I'll do  
When I go out on the street?  
  
Pure sin, pure sin  
The kind you won't mind  
The kind there could be trouble in  
  
I can barely see your sneakers  
You're dripping paint all over the place  
Why not get right to the point  
And splash it right on my face!  
  
How do you see me?  
As silly and sweet?  
But do you know what I'll do  
When I go out on the street.  
  
Pure sin, pure sin  
The kind you won't mind  
The kind there could be trouble in


Riverboat gambler  
Drinking alone on the prow  
Chasing your Bourbon with Tennessee gin  
The big game's about to begin  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Hiding that Ave up your sleeve  
I can see through all that debonaire style  
The irony bending your smile  
  
And I won't tip your hand  
I won't do you in  
I want to stay near you  
I want you to win  
  
Riverboat gambler  
You can defy all the odds  
You can draw diamonds to fill out your flush  
You can find someone to trust  
  
And I won't steal your chips  
I won't steal your pride  
Won't you take me on faith  
Won't you let me inside  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Under our velvet and lace  
You're an old vagabond, I'm a poor waif  
Let's make a place that's safe  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Come on and let me inside


People who have bad times  
Write hard luck songs  
But when their days are green  
They think about love  
Sunshine, flowers in a garden  
Did I bump you sir?  
I'm beggin' your pardon  
have you seen such a day?  
Let's begin it by startin'  
And rollin' down the hills with me.  
  
People who have short hair  
Write short hair songs  
But when their hair gets long  
They think about winding it around in daisy chains  
Waitin' for the showers  
Just to wash it in the rain  
Have you seen such hair?  
Well let the wind play  
As you're rollin' down the hills with me  
  
People who have no hills  
Write songs about plains  
But if that's not what you want to do  
Well you can jump aboard a bus  
Or boat or wooden canoe  
I know just the mountain  
That's been waitin' for you  
Too write songs about the peaks  
And the beautiful views  
As you're rollin' down the hills with me.


We stand shoulder to shoulder  
We see eye to eye  
We dive deep under water  
We jump high in the sky  
  
We stand shoulder to shoulder  
We stand side to side  
When one of us gets a tiny bit tired  
One gives the other a ride  
  
I've never had a best friend before  
So I can't be sure what it feels like  
But I think it feels more like this  
I think I feel more like myself  
When I'm with you  
  
Finding, losing and finding  
Losing and finding  
Making a bond that is strong  
Building a house for our friendship  
Breathing a breath for our song  
For our song


Sa May istasyon ihahatid ka  
Tinititigan bagahe mong dala  
Minamasdan kita,  
Mamaya'y wala ka na  
  
Sa may istasyon kasama kita  
Pinipigil luha sa 'king mata  
Ngayo'y kapiling ka,  
Mamaya'y nag-iisa na  
  
Hanggang sa muli,  
Iiwasang sa isip ka lagi  
Di hahanapin o kakailanganin  
Di sasabihing mahal ka sa akin  
Hangang sa muli  
Pipiliting huwag kang alalahanin  
Di nanaisin yakap mo't halik  
Di sasabihing sana'y magbalik  
Hangang sa muli  
  
Sa may istasyon ika'y sasakay na  
Papalayo na'y sinusundan pa  
Ika'y wala na ako'y nakatingin pa  
Hangang sa muli


I see from look in your eyes, there's  
Something I could never deny  
For the first the first  
After all this time  
I found true love  
  
I have never been so happy in my life  
Till you finally showed me for the first time  
I know this time I found true love  
  
CHROUS  
And I believe from the moment we met  
Your love is truly as good as it is  
That, once I let you go  
I'll never be happy again  
  
And I believe for the very first time  
Your love is truly  
Meant to be mine  
And my heart knows once I let you go  
I'll never be happy again  
  
You gave me the reason to live, now  
All I ever want is to give you all of me  
Cause I believe you gave me true love  
  
REPEAT CHORUS


If I believe in paradise,  
I swear I must be there.  
I swear I must be there right now with you.  
If I believe in miracles,  
I'd know that one was happening to me.  
  
But I don't believe in paradise  
And miracles are not real.  
Then, someone tell me what is this I feel?  
  
Chorus:  
I wanna believe it's love this time.  
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me lies.  
But with you I can't deny.  
If I believe in paradise,  
I swear...  
I'm there.  
  
If I believe in magic spells,  
It all would be so clear:  
A magic spell must have brought you here.  
If I can see the future,  
I'd see if you and I were meant to be.  
  
But I don't know any magic,  
And tomorrow's just a dream.  
Then something in this fantasy is real.  
  
I wanna believe it's love this time.  
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me lies.  
I wanna believe it's love this time.  
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me lies.  
But with you I can't deny  
If I believe in paradise, I swear...  
I'm there.  
  
I'm there...  
I swear...  
If I believe.


Di ko maintindihan  
Ang nilalaman ng puso  
Tuwing magkahawak ang ating kamay  
Pinapanalangin lagi tayong magkasama  
Hinihiling bawat oras kapiling ka  
  
Sa lahat ng aking ginagawa  
Ikaw lamang ang nasa isip ko sinta  
Sana'y di na tayo magkahiwalay  
Kahit kailan pa man  
  
Ikaw lamang ang aking minamahal  
Ikaw lamang ang tangi kong inaasam  
Makapiling ka habang buhay  
Ikaw lamang sinta  
Wala na kong hihingin pa  
Wala na  
  
Ayoko ng maulit pa  
  
Ang nakaraang ayokong maalala  
Bawat oras na wala ka  
Parang mabigat na parusa  
  
Huwag mong kakalimutan na kahit nag-iba  
Hindi ako tumigil magmahal sayo sinta  
  
Sa lahat ng aking ginagawa  
Ikaw lamang ang nasa isip ko sinta  
  
Sana'y di na tayo magkahiwalay  
Kahit kailan pa man  
  
Ikaw lamang ang aking minamahal  
Ikaw lamang ang tangi kong inaasam  
Makapiling ka habang buhay  
Ikaw lamang sinta  
Wala na kong hihingin pa  
Wala na


There are times that we are down  
And tired of runnin' off the shore  
There are times that we can't take it at all  
And we let our feelings down  
chorus  
Remember that I am your friend  
Who will always be there for you  
Whenever you're in pain  
Just call out and hear me say  
I'll be there.....  
(I'll be there.. I'll be there..)  
There are times we keep on losin' our way  
And we go astray  
There are times that we can't make it at all  
And we let our feelings down  
(Repeat chorus)


Maala-ala mo kaya  
Ang sumpa mo sa akin  
Na ang pag-ibig mo ay  
Sadyang di magmamaliw  
  
Kung nais mong matanto  
Buksan ang aking puso  
At tanging larawan mo  
Ang doo'y nakatago.  
  
Di ka kaya magbago  
Sa 'yong pagmamahal  
Hinding-hindi giliw ko  
Hanggang sa libingan  
  
O kay sarap mabuhay  
Lalo na't may lambingan  
Ligaya sa puso ko  
Ay di na mapaparam  
  
Maala-ala mo kaya  
Ang sumpa mo sa akin  
Na ang pag-ibig mo ay  
Sadyang magmamaliw


Love can't you see I'm alone  
Can't you give this fool a chance  
A little love is all I ask - a little kindness  
In the night  
Please don't leave me behind  
don't tell me love is blind  
A little love is all I ask and that is all  
  
Oh love I've been searching so long  
I've been searching high'n'low  
A little love is all I ask - a little sadness  
When you're gone  
Maybe you need a friend  
Only please don't let's pretend  
A little love is all I ask and that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings - but I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls the pretty girls go sailing by  
  
Ocean deep - I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep - will I ever find a lover  
Maybe he has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep - ocean deep  
  
Love can't you hear when I call  
Can't you hear a word I say  
A little love is all I ask  
A little feeling when we touch  
Why am I still alone?  
I've got a heart without a home  
A little love is all I ask - and that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings - but I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls and pretty girls go sailing by  
  
Ocean deep - I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep - will I ever find a lover  
Maybe he has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep - ocean deep  
  
I'm so lonely lonely lonely...  
Maybe..


The thought of you keeps haunting me  
And it's your face I always see  
Wherever I go, I always remember  
Soon it's Christmas, yes, it's Christmas  
But you're not here anymore  
  
The last time it was us together  
But we just can't make it last forever  
What can I do each time I remember  
Soon it's Christmas, ooh, it's Christmas again  
  
Chorus  
Though the stars shine so bright  
I just can't feel so right  
If I can't find a way to be with you again on Christmas day  
Yeah yeah  
  
[Repeat 2nd stanza]  
[Repeat chorus except last line]  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Soon it's Christmas, ahh  
Soon it's Christmas, yeah ahh  
Soon it's Christmas  
[Fading]


Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere  
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze  
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'  
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding  
The future that lies before me I cannot see  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising  
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
(Got to take the blame for an old love song)  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start


They tell me  
Somewhere this life isn't crazy  
But I've traveled the world far and wide  
And I say they're wrong  
  
Don't sell me  
Stories that music's a lady  
It's not when the singer's alone  
At the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]  
At the end of a song  
There's no one  
After the last note is played  
Only the memory stays  
Then even that fades away  
And there's nothing so hard  
As convincing your heart  
That you should start singing again  
  
You told me  
Nothing could change perfect lovers  
But like every promise you made  
It broke before long  
  
It's lonely  
Falling away from each other  
But we've come to the last of your words  
And the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]


Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
The little Lord Jesus, lays down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,  
And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.


Ah  
  
You know I can't smile without you  
  
I can't smile without you  
  
I can't laugh, and I can't sleep  
  
I don't even talk to people I meet  
  
And I feel sad when you're sad  
  
I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
You came along just like a song  
  
You brightened my day  
  
Who'd believe you were part of a dream  
  
That only seemed light years away  
  
  
And you know I can't smile without you  
  
I can't smile without you  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
Some people say the happiness wave  
  
Is somethin' that's hard to find  
  
Into the new leavin' the old behind me  
  
And I feel sad when you're sad  
  
I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
Into the new, leaving the old behind me  
  
And I feel sad when you're sad  
  
I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
You must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  


Hark! How the bells, sweet silver bells  
All seem to say, "Throw cares away."  
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer  
To young and old, meek and the bold  
Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song,  
With joyful ring, all caroling  
One seems to hear words of good cheer  
From everywhere, filling the air  
Oh!, how they pound, raising their sound  
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale  
  
Gaily they ring, while people sing  
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here!  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas!  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas!  
  
On, on they send, on without end  
Their joyful tone to every home  
Hark! How the bells, sweet silver bells  
All seem to say, "Throw cares away."  
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer  
To young and old, meek and the bold  
Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song  
With joyful ring, all caroling.  
One seems to hear words of good cheer  
From everywhere, filling the air  
O, how they pound, raising their sound  
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale  
  
Gaily they ring, while people sing  
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here!  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas!  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas!  
  
On, on they send, on without end  
Their joyful tone to every home.  
Ding dong ding dong...


It is he  
Christ who is born today  
Hear him crying  
In the manger  
  
King of Heaven  
Son of God  
Alleluia, Alleluia  
There he lies  
  
There with the lambkin  
Only swaddle for his garment  
With his Holy Mother Mary  
Alleluia, Alleluia  
  
Glory, Glory to almighty God  
And on earth peace to all men  
Hear the joyful angels singing  
Alleluia, Alleluia  
  
He is born  
Let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
King of Kings  
  
Prince of Peace  
For all the universe  
Alleluia, Alleluia


All through the year  
We've waited  
Waited through spring and fall  
To hear silver bells ringing  
See winter time bringing  
The happiest season of all  
  
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jackfrost nippin' at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes of a glow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times,  
Many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times,  
Many ways  
Merry Christmas to you


Green September  
  
Burned to October brown  
  
Bare November  
  
Led to December's frozen ground  
  
The seasons stumbled round  
  
Our drifting lives are bound  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Feather clouds cry  
  
A vale of tears to earth  
  
Morning breaks and  
  
No one sees the quiet mountain birth  
  
Dressed in a brand new day  
  
The sun is on its way  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Somewhere in  
  
A fairytale forest lies one  
  
Answer that is waiting to be heard  
  
  
  
You and I were  
  
Born like the breaking day  
  
All our seasons  
  
All our green Septembers  
  
Burn away  
  
Slowly we'll fade into  
  
A sea of midnight blue  
  
And a falling crescent noon  


I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night  
When an XKE pulled up on my right.  
He rolled down the window of his shiny, new Jag  
And challenged me then and there to a drag.  
I said, "You're on, Buddy, my mill's running fine  
Let's come of the line, now, at Sunset and Vine  
But I'll go ya one better, if you've got the nerve  
Let's race all the way ... to Deadman's Curve"  
  
CHORUS:  
Deadman's Curve--is no place to play  
Deadman's Curve--you best keep away  
Deadman's Curve--I can hear them say  
You won't come back from Deadman's Curve  
  
The street was deserted late Friday night,  
We were buggin' each other as we sat out the light  
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green  
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine  
I flew past La Brea, Schwabs, and Crescent Heights  
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights  
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve  
But I pulled it out and there we were: At Deadman's curve  
  
(SPOKEN) Well, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve  
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve  
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight  
I found out for myself that everyone was right:  
  
Won't come back from Deadman's Curve!  
  
Repeat chorus and fade


Said the night wind to the little lamb  
"Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite"  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
"Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea"  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
"Do you hear what I hear?  
In your palace warm, mighty king  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A child, a child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold"  
Said the king to the people everywhere  
"Listen to what I say!  
Pray for peace, people, everywhere  
Listen to what I say!  
The child, the child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light"


From this moment on you and me dear  
Only two for tea dear from this moment on  
From this happy day no more blue songs  
Only hoopty-do songs from this moment on  
For you got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
You got the sweet lips to kiss me good night  
From this moment on, you and I babe  
We'll be riding high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment on


I'll say goodbye to love  
No one ever cared if I should live or die  
Time and time again the chance for love  
Has passed me by  
And all I know of love  
Is how to live without it  
I just can't seem to find it.  
  
So I've made my mind up I must live  
My life alone  
And though it's not the easy way  
I guess I've always known  
I'd say goodbye to love.  
  
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine  
Surely time will lose these bitter memories  
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in  
And to live for something I could live for.  
  
All the years of useless search  
Have finally reached an end  
Loneliness and empty days will be my  
Only friend  
From this day love is forgotten  
I'll go on as best I can.  
  
What lies in the future  
Is a mystery to us all  
No one can predict the wheel of fortune  
As it falls  
There may come a time when I will see that  
I've been wrong  
But for now this is my song.  
  
And it's goodbye to love  
I'll say goodbye to love.


When I was young I'd listen to the radio  
Waitin' for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along  
It made me smile  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone  
But they're back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're startin' to sing's so fine  
When they get to the part  
Where he's breakin' her heart  
It can really make me cry just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad  
So much has changed  
It was songs of love that I would sing to then  
And I'd memorize each word  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're startin' to sing's so fine  
All my best memories  
Come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're startin' to sing's so fine  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  


I was born on a farm out in Ioway  
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away  
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone  
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear  
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear  
When I'd start to play folks used to say  
"Sounds a little Goofus to me"  
  
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony  
Hold that note and change the key, that's called "Goofus"  
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools  
But the folks just dance like fools, they go "Goofus"  
  
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long  
The leader said that I played all the music wrong  
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own  
Got together a new kind of orchestree  
And we all played just the same "Goofus" harmony  
And I must admit we made a hit  


Christmas future is far away  
Christmas past is past  
Christmas present is here today  
Bringing joy that will last  
  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now


Born in a stable He came here for me  
Born of a virgin He came here for me  
God's only son come to set the world free,  
Born of God's love and He came here for me.  
Savior, of the world I praise thee  
Jesus, Lamb of God, I pray to thee hear me  
As I praise thy birth bend down thy ear and hear my prayer  
Over a stable a star shone so bright,  
Guiding 3 wise men who rode through the night  
He was called baby Jesus, He came here for me,  
Born to this world, then He died here for me.  
  


When I was younger do much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in any way  
But now these days are gone I'm not so self-assured  
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the door  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please?  
(Please help me, please help me)  
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
And every now and then I feel so insecure  
(Every now and then so insecure)  
I know that I need you like I've never done before  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please?  
(Please help me, please help me)  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please?  
(Please help me, please help me)  


Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
Vixen, Blitzen  
And all his reindeer  
Pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing  
Children singing  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings  
And say your prayers  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
He's got a bag  
That's filled with toys  
For boys and girls again  
Hear those sleigh bells  
Jingle jangle  
What a beautiful sight  
Jump in bed  
Cover up your head  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
He doesn't care  
If you're rich or poor  
He loves you just the same  
Santa knows  
That we're God's children  
That makes everything right  
Fill your hearts  
With Christmas cheer  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
He'll come around  
When the church rings out  
It's Christmas morn again  
Peace on Earth  
Will come to all  
If we  
Just follow the light  
Let's give thanks  
To the Lord above  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight


Sing, sing a song  
Make it simple to last  
Your whole life long  
Don't worry that it's not  
Good enough for anyone  
Else to hear  
Just sing, sing a song  
  
Why do stars  
Fall down from the sky?  
Everytime you walk by  
Just like me  
They long to be  
Close to you  
  
Just like me  
They long to be  
Close to you  
  
Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, close to you  
Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, close to you  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, close to you  
  
Let's take a lifetime to say  
I knew you well  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow for all we know  
  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
And he don't care (Baby, baby)  
Don't care (Baby, baby)  
  
Baby, baby  
Feels like maybe things will be all right  
Baby, baby  
Your love's made me  
Free as a song singin' forever  
  
Only yesterday when I was sad  
And I was lonely  
You showed me the way to leave  
The past and all it's tears behind me  
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today  
Since I threw my sadness away  
Only yesterday  
  
(Guitar Solo)  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
I don't wanna talk  
About the things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  
I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
I don't wanna talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
  
The winner takes it all, oh  
  
(Guitar Solo Continued)  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's her destiny, hee  
  
I can't live, if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore (The winner takes it all, oh)  
I can't live, if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore  
I can't live, if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
(Guitar Solo Until End)


What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
What do you get when you kiss a guy?  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia.  
After you do, he'll never phone you.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
Don't tell me what is all about,  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out,  
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You get enough tears to fill an ocean  
That's what you get for your devotion.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow.  
So, for at least until tomorrow,  
I'll never fall in love again!  
I'll never fall in love again!


Always have said there is a thing called love  
And in my life, I said the word a thousand times  
Looking around I can see lovers, lost in a world that's all their own  
Though people say love is everywhere,  
I'm looking for love, but it's just not there  
  
I live my live growing from day to day  
Hoping I'll fined someone who cares  
Though people say love is everywhere,  
I'm looking for love, but it's just not there  
I'm looking for love, but it's just not there  


Let us put man and woman together  
  
And see wich one is smarter  
  
Some say man, but I say no  
  
The women got the man like a puppet show  
  
It ain't me, it's the people that say  
  
The men are leadin' the women astray  
  
But I say, that the women today  
  
Are smarter than men in every way  
  
Well, that's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
Little boy sat down and cried  
  
An old man passin' asked him why, he said  
  
I can't do what the big boys do  
  
Old man sat down and he cried too  
  
Ain't me, it's the people that say  
  
The men are leadin' the women astray  
  
But I say, that the women today  
  
Are smarter than men in every way  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
Well that's right, the women are smarter  
  
Smarter than man in every way

Only a fool like fools before me  
I always think with my heart  
Only a fool, that same old story  
Seems I was born for the part  
It's a lesson to be learned  
And a page I should have turned  
I shouldn't cry but I do, like an ordinary fool  
When his ordinary dreams fall through  
How many times have I mistaken  
Good looks and laughs for bad news?  
And how many times have I mistaken  
Good looks and laughs for the blues?  
When a road I walked before  
Ends alone at my front door  
I shouldn't cry but I do, like an ordinary fool  
When his ordinary dreams fall through  
When a road I walked before  
Ends alone at my front door  
I shouldn't cry but I do, like an ordinary fool  
When his ordinary dreams fall through  


Sleep well, little children  
  
Wherever you are  
  
Tomorrow is Christmas  
  
Beneath every star  
  
Soon the snowflakes will fall  
  
And tomorrow you'll see  
  
Every wish, one and all  
  
Waiting under the tree  
  
Sleep well, little children  
  
Pleasant dreams through the night  
  
Tomorrow is Christmas  
  
All merry and bright  
  
Soon you'll hear the bells ring  
  
Time for dreams to come true  
  
As the world wakes you dream  
  
Merry Christmas to you


I want somebody to share  
Share the rest of my life  
Share my innermost thoughts  
Know my intimate details  
Someone who'll stand by my side  
And give me support  
And in return  
She'll get my support  
She will listen to me  
When I want to speak  
About the world we live in  
And life in general  
Though my views may be wrong  
They may even be perverted  
She will hear me out  
And won't easily be converted  
To my way of thinking  
In fact she'll often disagree  
But at the end of it all  
She will understand me  
  
I want somebody who cares  
For me passionately  
With every thought and with every breath  
Someone who'll help me see things  
In a different light  
All the things I detest  
I will almost like  
I don't want to be tied  
To anyone's strings  
I'm carefully trying to steer clear  
Of those things  
But when I'm asleep  
I want somebody  
Who will put their arms around me  
And kiss me tenderly  
Though things like this  
Make me sick  
In a case like this  
I'll get away with it


I think I'm gonna be sad,  
I think it's today, yeah.  
The girl that's driving me mad  
Is going away.  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
But she don't care.  
She said that living with me  
Is bringing her down yeah.  
For she would never be free  
When I was around.  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
But she don't care.  
I don't know why she's ridin' so high,  
She ought to think twice,  
She ought to do right by me.  
Before she gets to saying goodbye,  
She ought to think twice,  
She ought to do right by me.  
I think I'm gonna be sad,  
I think it's today yeah.  
The girl that's driving me mad  
Is going away, yeah.  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
But she don't care.  
I don't know why she's ridin' so high,  
She ought to think twice,  
She ought to do right by me.  
Before she gets to saying goodbye,  
She ought to think twice,  
She ought to do right by me.  
She said that living with me,  
Is bringing her down, yeah.  
For she would never be free  
When I was around.  
Ah, she's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
She's got a ticket to ride,  
But she don't care.  
My baby don't care, my baby don't care.  
My baby don't care, my baby don't care.  
My baby don't care, my baby don't care.


Well, there's two sides, to every situation  
Yes, there's two sides, two interpretations  
A laugh is a cry, hello means goodbye  
You're sayin' something baby, I don't wanna buy  
  
Well, there's two sides to every creation  
You and me babe, we're no revelation  
Well, there's darkness in our light, and there's wrong in our right  
There's sorry babe, I'm workin' late tonight  
  
Well, there's two sides, there's another side of me  
There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see  
It's never really lived, but it's never really died  
It's never really made it but it's tried  
  
Well, there's two sides to every conversation  
But with you babe, that's no consolation  
Silence is golden, let me put you on hold  
Danglin' on your love line, baby, it's growin' old  
  
Well, I don't know how to say it  
Cause I never thought I could  
God know I've tried so many times  
  
  
But there's two sides, there's another side of me  
There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see  
It's never really lived, but it's never really died  
It's never really made it, but it's tried  
  
To every creation  
We're no revelation  
One sees the wrong, and one sees the right  
The other side of me just caught a flight  
  
Goodbye  


Maybe it's much too early in the game  
Aah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's Eve?  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night  
Welcoming in the New Year  
New Year's Eve  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of a thousand invitations  
You received  
Aah, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's Eve?  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of a thousand invitations  
You received  
Aah, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's Eve?  


That endless season  
  
When time was all we had  
  
We saw forever  
  
And caught it in our hands  
  
Life was a charm  
  
Our hearts were filled with music  
  
And laughter  
  
When time was all we had  
  
  
  
I never will forget your face in silhouette  
  
Your voice will be the sweetest sound  
  
I'll ever hear and yet  
  
We knew somehow the song would never end  
  
When time was all we had to spend


You're enough  
If I never had another  
Never hold another lover  
Baby, you're enough  
All the rest are second best  
Compared to you  
  
You're enough  
If I never know another  
After what we've known together  
Baby, you're enough  
I've already had my sweetest dreams come true  
  
Can't you see  
In these eyes that adore you  
I've been waiting here for you  
Baby, can't you see  
Look at me  
See love's greatest non-believer  
Believing that she might be seeing love  
In your eyes  
  
Stars above  
Made for wishin', made for dreamers  
Won't you listen to this heart  
And what it's dreamin' of  
If they'll only shine their lucky starlight down on me  
Make it bright enough for only you to see  
That, baby, you're enough for me


Oh don't say those same idle lies  
I've heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Won't buy no more  
  
Oh no don't use  
Those same weeping eyes  
Ill wipe them no more  
I didn't want to have to be cruel  
But the truth must be said  
And you ain't heard enough  
  
Oh it was not so long ago  
Since you wandered out of here  
To become a silver model  
Of a city on the air  
So don't choke me with your lies  
Because this man has open eyes  
And I can see  
I can see I can tell  
  
I had it enough  
All those sneaky bars and smart parties  
Had enough  
All those sweet friends and lovers  
I've I've had enough  
All those lonely rooms  
And blank faces  
Had enough  
And I want you I want you no more  
I want you I want you no more  
  
Oh don't say those same idle lies  
I've heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Won't buy no more


She moves like and angel  
And seven evening stars  
Dance through the window  
Of her universal house  
  
He voice a crystal echo  
Lies humming in your soul  
So patiently awaiting  
For your ears to behold  
  
She ripples on the water  
Leaves diamonds on the shore  
And fish from every distance  
Watch her ocean cellar door  
Her breath a warm fire  
In every lovers heart  
A mistress to magicians  
And a dancer to the gods  
And a dancer to the gods  
  
Her clothes are made of rainbows  
And twenty thousand tears  
Shine through the spaces  
Of her golden ochre hair  
Ooh my babe I want you  
And on my life I swear  
My conscience will I follow you forever  
If you meet me everywhere  
Yes if you if you meet me everywhere


[Chorus: ]  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
I got in town a month ago  
I've seen a lot of girls since then  
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em  
But as yet I haven't met 'em  
That's how I'm in the state I'm in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another fella told me  
He had a sister who looked just fine  
Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat named Frankenstein  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's hard on a fella  
When he don't know his way around  
If I don't find me a honey  
To help me spend my money  
I'm gonna have to blow this town  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful ooo  
I'm in an awful way  
He's in an awful way  
  
I'm in an awful ooo  
I'm in an awful way  
He's in an awful way  
I'm in an awful way


I gave my last chance to you  
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue  
No bitterblue  
  
Yes, I've done all one man can do  
Don't pass me up oh bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
  
Cause I've been running a long time  
On this travelling ground  
Wishing hard to be free  
Of going round and round  
Yes I've been moving a long time  
But only up and down  
I gave my last hope to you  
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
  
I've done all one man can do  
Please help me lose this bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
Cause I've been waiting a long time  
Aeons been and gone --  
Looking at the horizon  
For my light to dawn  
Oh yes I've been living a long time  
Looking on and on  
  
I've been running a long time  
Summers come and gone --  
Drifting under the dream clouds  
Past the broken sun --  
  
Yes I've been living a long time  
To be back beyond  
I gave my first chance to you  
Don't hand it back bitterblue  
My bitterblue  
  
I've done all one man can do  
Don't pass me up oh bitterblue  
My bitterblue, bitterblue  
  
I gave my last chance to you  
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue


I don't want to work away  
Doing just what they all say  
Work hard boy and you'll find  
One day you'll have a job like mine  
  
'Cause I know for sure  
Nobody should be that poor  
To say yes or sink low  
Because you happen to say so, say so, you say so  
  
I don't want to work away  
Doing just what they all say  
Work hard boy and you'll find  
One day you'll have a job like mine, job like mine, a job like mine  
  
Be wise, look ahead  
Use your eyes he said  
Be straight, think right  
But I might die tonight!


Oh I can't keep it in can't keep it in  
I've gotta let it out.  
  
I've got to show the world, world's got to see.  
See all the love, love that's in me, I said  
Why walk alone. Why worry when it's warm over here.  
You got so much to say, say what you mean.  
Mean what you're thinkin', and think anything.  
Oh why, why must you waste you're life away.  
  
You've got to live for today, then let it go, oh  
Lover, I want to spend this time with you.  
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know.  
And I can't keep it in, I can't hide it and  
I can't lock it away.  
  
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood  
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love.  
No I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in  
I've gotta let it out  
  
I've got to show the world, world's got to know,  
Know of the love, love that lies low,  
So why can't you say, if you know then why can't you say  
You've got too much deceit, and deceit kills the light.  
Light, needs has to shine,  
I said shine light, shine light.  
Love, that no way to live you life.  
  
You allow too much to go by, and that won't do, no  
Lover, I want to have you here by my side  
Now don't you run don't you hide  
while I'm with you now I can't keep it in,  
I can't keep it in I gotta let it out  
  
I've gotta show the world, worlds's got to see see all the love,  
love that's in me I said why walk alone  
Why worry when it's warm over here  
You got so much to say, say what you mean  
Mean what you're thinkin' and thing anything, why not?  
Now why why why not?


Cats in the Cradle  
By Harry Chapin  
  
A child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
And he was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you"  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned ten just the other day  
He said "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on lets play  
Can you teach me to throw? " I said, "Not today,  
I got a lot to do" He said "that's okay"  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
And said "I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm going to be like him"  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
Well he came from college just the other day  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"  
He shook his head, and he said with a smile  
  
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later, can I have them please? "  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Son, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said "Id like to see you if you don't mind"  
He said "Id love to Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new jobs a hassle, and the kids have the flu.  
But It's sure nice talking to you, Dad,  
It's been sure nice talking to you........ "  
And as I hung up the phone it had occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me,  
My boy was just like me..............  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Son, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then, Dad  
We're gonna have a good time then.


Why don't you come over?  
It's lonely at the wooden lodge  
Why don't you come and see our baby?  
You haven't seen her for so long  
  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
  
There in the back woods  
We had our little piece of land  
But everything wasn't so groovy  
Not when you had to dirty your hands  
  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
  
It's lonely at the wooden lodge  
So why don't you share my bed  
  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me  
Come on baby, shift that log  
Come on baby, wash that dog  
Give me all the love you've got, to me


You've got to learn, to brighten up your ways  
Kick out your dull padded life  
There's much to know, and no doors in space  
They were only mirrors you imagined in your mind  
Now that you've got no place to go  
And you stand alone  
Know that there's just one place to be  
And it's in your soul, oh  
Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you  
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through  
Like morning meets the moon, my love will guide the way  
It's time to wipe your eyes not, and awake  
I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do  
I've come to take you over, then it's up to you  
  
Be like the light, in the shadows  
Throw down your mask and be real  
Don't wish to win, and don't mind to lose  
That was just a cycle like a squirrel in a wheel  
Now that you've got no place to look  
And you stand alone  
Know that's there's just one place to be  
And it is your home, oh  
Like fish that seek the water, the truth will come to you  
Like leaves upon the soil, they will find ways through  
Like flowers seek the sun, my love will guide the way  
It's time to wipe your eyes now, and awake.  
  
You say you're really with me but you only follow me around  
How much you love me yes,  
But I don't want the kind of love  
I have to sit down and count  
  
You think you're free and lucky but you're stuck behind a prison wall  
How well you know yourself  
But I see something else within you  
That you don't see at all  
You may give up your number, disowning all your wealth  
You may sell all the pieces, but you'll  
Never never never give up  
Yourself, oh no no no.  
  
Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you  
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through  
Like morning meets the night's stars, my love will guide the way  
It's time to wipe your eyes not, and awake  
I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do  
I've come to take you over, then it's up to you.


It's not time to make a change  
Just relax, take it easy  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to know  
Find a girl, settle down  
If you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
I was once like you are now  
And I know that it's not easy  
To be calm when you've found  
Something going on  
But take your time, think a lot  
Think of everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow  
But your dreams may not  
  
How can I try to explain?  
When I do he turns away again  
It's always been the same, same old story  
From the moment I could talk  
I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way  
And I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
It's not time to make a change  
Just sit down, take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down  
If you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
All the times that I've cried  
Keeping all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right I'd agree  
But it's them they know, not me  
Now there's a way  
And I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go


And in the morning when you fill my eyes  
I knew that day I couldn't do,  
Ah, no wrong, I couldn't do.  
  
And so my mind begins to memorize  
'Cause time will never seem the same,  
Ah, no more, never again.  
  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go,  
My legs are weak my heels are low.  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll.  
Can't make no headway on this road.  
  
There's an empty space inside me now,  
A wasteland deep beneath the snow,  
So cold, nothing'll grow.  
  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go,  
My legs are weak my heels are low.  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll.  
Can't make no headway on this road. What road?  
  
And in the morning when you fill my eyes  
I knew that day I couldn't do,  
Ah, no wrong, I couldn't do.


Come on lets go down  
Everybody's waiting for us  
Down at the ghost town  
Bill Bailey said he'd be around  
If Mrs. G. Robinson would just put  
That bad Havana down  
  
Lovely Queen Anne Boleyn  
Learning new tricks from the Great Houdini.  
Now that's the way she's gonna make it  
Come on

In the Kitchen with mum

Are waiting for Disney to wake up  
Now that's the way  
No that ain't the way he's gonna make it

I never did think twice about ever coming to you

Granny, granny, what on earth can I do?  
  
'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild  
She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild  
  
You always straightened me out  
When I was feeling rough  
But this one I really doubt  
Cause this one's really tough  
  
Oh granny, what on earth can i do?  
Granny, granny, what on earth can i do?  
  
'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild  
She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild  
  
So, granny, what on earth can i do?  
Granny, granny, what on earth can i do?  
  
'Cause this little girl, this little girl, she's a driving me wild  
She's a driving me wild, so wild, so wild, so wild

When you ask them - What you come here for?  
I don't know - Why?

Home on a kite we fly,  
Home on a breeze we blow  
Eying the folks below and  
Watching everybody run,  
Each one heading for a different place  
Watching everybody hide,  
Each behind a different face  
  
Home where the days are long  
Back where the people are free,  
Home where all sides agree and,  
Everybody has a friend, oh  
And no one ever has to grab  
Everybody shares the love,  
Giving everything they have.  
  
Forever forever your lamp will burn  
Forever home forever would that you'd learn  
That you came with nothing  
So with nothing you'll return  
  
Home  
You know you're not alone  
It's only 'cause you're not a home  
That you feel so out of place.  
Forever forever your lamp will burn  
Forever home forever would that you'd learn  
  
That you came with nothing  
So with nothing you'll return  
  
Home where all the mums can sing,  
Back where the children don't cry,  
Home where you never ask why and  
Everybody has enough, and ya don't have to put on clothes  
Nobody has to hide 'case everyone already knows.


Come the morning I'll be far from here  
Slowly rising in another sphere  
  
Old world goodbye cause I'll be  
Home in the sky in the morning bye bye  
  
Stars are crying over my old house  
But I'm still breathing happy above the clouds  
  
Home  
Home at last because  
All of the bad times are past  
  
Music is a lady that I still love  
Cause she gives me the air that I breathe  
  
Music is a lady that I still need  
Cause she brings me the food that I eat  
  
Come the morning I'll be far from here  
Slowly rising in another sphere  
Home, world goodbye  
Cause Ill be home in the sky in the morning  
Bye bye


I want to be your honey man  
I want to be, I want to be your honey man  
To wash your clothes and hold your hand  
I want to be, I want to be your honey man  
  
You've got a lot  
But all of your money and stuff  
Just isn't enough to buy what I can give  
When things get rough  
And all of your friendliest friends  
Are turning to dust  
  
We will live  
You know I'll give you the world  
I'll sacrifice girl anything  
I'll do it all on my own, believe me


How can I tell you  
That I love you,  
I love you  
But I can't think of right words to say  
  
I long to tell you  
That I'm always thinking of you...  
I'm always thinking of you,  
But my words just blow away,  
Just blow away  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey  
And I can't think of right words to say  
  
Wherever I am girl,  
I'm always walking with you  
I'm always walking with you,  
But I look and you're not there  
  
Whoever I'm with,  
I'm always, always talking to you  
I'm always talking to you,  
And I'm sad that you can't hear,  
Sad that you can't hear  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey,  
When I look and you're not there  
  
I need to know you,  
Need to feel my arms around you  
Feel my arms around you,  
Like a sea around a shore  
  
Each night and day I pray,  
In hope that I might find you,  
In hope that I might find you,  
Because heart's can do no more  
Can do no more  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey,  
Still I kneel upon the floor  
  
How can I tell you  
That I love you,  
I love you  
But I can't think of right words to say  
  
I long to tell you  
That I'm always thinking of you  
I'm always thinking of you....  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey  
And I can't think of right words to say


'Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can forget the chance  
That I didn't have to know you  
And live in peace, in peace  
  
'Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can forget the plans that  
I didn't use to get you  
At home, with me, alone  
  
Oh yeah  
  
'Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can recall the way  
That I used to be, before you  
And sleep at night, and dream  
'Cause if I laugh, baby if I laugh  
Just a little bit  
Oh yeah


I'm so sleepy, yeah  
I'm so sleepy, yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy  
  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
In the night I feel it creeping, creeping, creeping  
  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy  
  
I can't keep my mind away from my dreams,  
I hear them calling, calling, calling  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
In the night I'm gonna slip away  
I won't fight it, I'll just ride it  
  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy  
Yeah


See the funny little people running 'round in circles  
Throwing bombs as they do  
See the funny side of it  
They're heading straight for you  
  
See the funny little holes they're making  
Looking like craters on the moon  
See the funny side of it  
We'll be living in them soon  
  
But it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live  
Yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live  
But it's getting pretty near the end  
Cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend  
So there's never anything to spend  
You're broke, you dope you  
  
See the funny little flying saucers we found  
Painted up just for you  
See the funny man inside  
His color matches too  
  
See the silly little camera he loves  
Shooting pictures with all day  
See the funny side of it  
His friends are on their way  
  
But it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live  
Yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live  
But it's getting pretty near the end  
Cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend  
So there's never anything to spend  
You're broke, you dope you  
  
Baby it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live  
Yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live


Baby, I've never had a single thing in my life I could call my own.  
There you were, holding a love so true,  
Now I've got a home, now I've got a home.  
  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love, baby  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world, baby  
  
Baby, you really make me feel like a king, a king without a crown.  
But darlin', Promise me one little thing: That you won't let me down.  
  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love, baby  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world, baby  
  
Don't ever tell me lies baby,  
Don't take me for a ride baby,  
Just stay here by my side baby,  
We won't ever stop.  
  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
I found a love, baby  
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet  
Hidden away from the world, baby


I buy the nicest things from a super market store  
Vitamin land and marzipan and I know just what they're all for  
I've organized my useless life in a way I've never done before  
Even visit the dentist now  
  
But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter  
I'm on my way  
Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter  
I'm hoping to stay  
'Cause I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old  
  
I just can't wait to see that city on the moon  
With air conditioned gardens that'll play your favorite tune  
I'll see my feet upon that street if it's the last thing that I'll do  
Even sweep the roads to be there  
  
But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter  
I'm on my way  
Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter  
I'm hoping to stay  
'Cause I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old  
  
I'll see my feet upon that street if it's the last thing that I'll do  
Even sweep the roads to be there  
  
But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter  
I'm on my way  
Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter  
I'm hoping to stay  
'Cause I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old


They used to call him Jesus  
Long time ago  
They're still calling him Jesus  
Don't you know  
They crossed the wood and hanged him  
A long time ago  
They still misunderstand him  
Those who don't know  
And in the evening his love will lead the blind  
In every secret corner there in your mind  
  
They called him Gautama Buddha  
Oh long time ago  
He turned the world to order  
Don't you know  
He used to sit knowing  
Oh long time ago  
Where you and me were going  
And in the evening his love will lead the blind


Well I ain't got nothing,  
But it don't worry me.  
I came to this life like a free-walking tree.  
No need to be tied, no need to be.  
They call me Jzero.  
  
Well I ain't got nothing,  
And to nothing I belong.  
You won't find me right,  
Yet you won't find me wrong.  
If you think about me,  
Don't think too long.  
Jus' call me Jzero.  
  
Well I don't house no past,  
Never carried a key.  
My sun doesn't rise from under the sea.  
There is only one morning,  
Eternally, dee d'lee d'lee.  
  
Well he says he hasn't got nothing,  
But he seems to possess less.  
He waltzed through the door,  
Like a tapdance with death.  
What kind of fool is he?  
  
No need to guess, jus' call me Jzero.  
  
Well I don't eat a lot.  
I do work for nothing, so  
If there's a job I can fill the gap.  
I don't need a room, bed, or pillow, oh  
Once you've decided to trust me with time,  
You won't need to look back  
A doo, de, doo, de, doo.  
  
Well I ain't got nothing,  
But it don't worry me.  
I came to this life like a free-walking tree.  
No need to be tied, no need to be.  
They call me Jzero.


I sit beside the dark  
Beneath the mire  
Cold gray dusty day  
The morning lake  
Drinks up the sky  
  
Katmandu I'll soon be seeing you  
And your strange bewildering time  
Will hold me down  
  
Pass me my hat and coat  
Lock up the cabin  
Slow night treat me right  
Until I go  
Be nice to know  
  
Katmandu I'll soon be touching you  
And your strange bewildering time  
Will hold me down  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Chop me some broken wood  
We'll start a fire  
White warm light the dawn  
And help me see  
Old Satan's tree  
  
Katmandu I'll soon be touching you  
And your strange bewildering time  
Will keep me home


I work in the mornin', I work in the night  
The men on the block, they just laugh at me  
I work in the mornin', I work in the night  
The men on the block, they just laugh at me  
  
But when they're wiping their silver spoons  
Palming the men for some bread,  
I'll be laughing  
Way, way out of my head!  
  
When my little kitty gets out,  
There's gonna be a party, a party no doubt  
When my little kitty gets out  
There's gonna be a party  
  
And if my mind isn't coming so fast  
The men on the block say I'm on the brink  
And if my mind isn't coming so fast  
And I ain't so dumb as some people think  
  
'Cause when they're wiping their silver spoons  
Palming the men for some bread  
I'll be laughing, way way out of my head


My Lady d'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?  
I'll wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill.  
  
My Lady d'Arbanville why does it grieve me so?  
But your heart seems so silent.  
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low,  
  
My Lady d'Arbanville why do you sleep so still?  
I'll wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill.  
  
My Lady d'Arbanville, you look so cold tonight.  
Your lips feel like winter,  
Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white.  
  
My Lady d'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?  
I'll wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill.  
  
La la la la la  
  
My Lady d'Arbanville why does it grieve me so?  
But your heart seems so silent.  
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low,  
  
I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie,  
I'll always be with you  
This rose will never die, this rose will never die.  
  
I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie,  
I'll always be with you  
This rose will never die, this rose will never die.


If you don't love me  
Please don't treat me this way  
Cause I can't stand it  
I see our love slipping away  
Did you think you could just put me down  
Like a worn out shoe  
Cause if you don't want me  
Maybe I don't want you  
  
If you don't need me  
Don't leave me out in the cold  
Eyes drifting by me  
Like somebody you don't know  
Did you think that you could just walk away  
Anytime you wanted to  
Cause if you don't love me  
Maybe I don't love you  
  
Did you think that you could just put me down  
For somebody new  
Cause nobody can love you girl like I do  
Every little bird in the sky  
Would sing a song of love  
  
If you would just take me back  
Come on open up your heart again  
Let me in baby baby  
  
If you don't love me  
Stop fooling yourself  
No more acting  
I know your show too well  
Did you think that you could just shake my hand  
With a how d'y'do  
Cause if you don't want me  
Maybe I don't want you  
  
Oh and as you go through life  
It's the little things that come back again  
If you came back again  
You know I'd give my loving to you


Lovely city, when do you laugh?  
Stoney people, what do you have?  
  
Well, you ride around on a bright shiny cloud  
And you think that you've found true happiness  
There's no method in your mind  
And your tempers are kind  
Is it too much to ask to give it a rest?  
  
Lovely city, when do you laugh?  
Stoney people, what do you have?  
  
I'm a part of you, you don't wanna be  
I'm an unexpected visitor who's dropped in for tea  
But I'm not so low you don't even know that I'm here  
You can't even see  
  
Lovely city, when do you laugh?  
Stoney people, what do you have?


Now maybe you're right and maybe you're wrong  
But I ain't gonna argue with you no more  
I've done it for too long.  
It was getting so good why then, where did it go?  
I can't think about it no more tell me if you know.  
You were loving me, I was loving you  
But now there ain't nothing but regretting  
Nothing, nothing but regretting everything we do.  
  
I put up with your lies like you put up with mine,  
But God knows we should have stopped somewhere,  
We could have taken the time,  
But time has turned, yes, some call it the end.  
So tell me, tell me did you really love me like a friend?  
You know you don't have to pretend,  
It's all over now It'll never happen again, no no no,  
It'll never happen again , it won't happen again  
Never, never, never, it'll never happen again  
No, no, no, no  
  
So maybe you're right, and maybe you're wrong  
But I ain't gonna argue with you no more  
I've done it for too long.  
It was getting so good why then, where did it go?  
I can't think about it no more tell me if you know.  
You were loving me, I was loving you  
But now there ain't nothing but regretting  
Nothing, nothing but regretting everything we do.


[Chorus:]  
Oh, I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow, moon shadow, moonshadow---  
Leapin and hoppin' on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---  
  
And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plough, lose my land,  
Oh if I ever lose my hands, Oh if I won't have to work no more.  
  
And if I ever lose my eyes, if my colours all run dry,  
Yes if I ever lose my eyes, Oh if I won't have to cry no more.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if I ever lose my legs, I won't moan, and I won't beg,  
Yes if I ever lose my legs, Oh if I won't have to walk no more.  
  
And if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north and south,  
Yes if I ever lose my mouth, Oh if I won't have to talk...  
  
Did it take long to find me? I asked the faithful light.  
Did it take long to find me? And are you gonna stay the night?  
  
[Chorus]  
Moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow.


Morning has broken like the first morning,  
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.  
Praise for the singing,  
Praise for the morning,  
Praise for them springing fresh from the world.  
  
Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven,  
Like the first dewfall on the first grass.  
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,  
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass.  
  
Mine is the sunlight,  
Mine is the morning,  
Born of the one light Eden saw play.  
Praise with elation, praise ev'ry morning,  
God's recreation of the new day.  
  
Morning has broken...


New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Cars choking your child to death  
But you don't want to see  
Cause you only think about yourself  
How blind can you be  
  
New York poor New York  
Sniper on the rooftop New York  
New York poor New York  
Not fit for a dog in New York  
  
Everybody bites on the Big Apple  
Leave the hungry in tears  
But no one gives a damn no one really cares  
How they feel they're just paper people not real  
  
You need a gun to walk into New York  
  
Now you're broke and you're out on a ledge  
Who can help you this time  
Now you're down to your very last cent  
Still you're askin' me who was your friend  
I was your friend  
  
New York poor New York  
Who turned the lights out in New York  
  
New York poor New York  
Just another blackout in New York  
  
Girl dead on the 26th floor  
But no one knew her name  
Found her body behind the door  
Too young for the game  
  
New York poor New York  
Devils in the subway New York  
New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
Talkin' talkin' talkin', watch out  
Harlem touching midtown New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Talkin' 'bout New York New York  
Money's getting tighter New York  
They're burning the bridges to New York


Who'll be my love  
You'll be my love  
You'll be my sky above  
Who'll be my light  
You'll be my light  
You'll be my day and night  
You'll be mine tonight  
  
Ruby eekyaa.  
Ehla xana, ehla xana kondamou  
Ehla bruwee, maydeenabee  
Seesu samee ahkeeraa  
Ruby ruby kree  
  
Ruby my love  
You'll be my love  
You'll be my sky above  
Ruby my light  
You'll be my light  
You'll be my day and night  
You'll be mine tonight


It's so quiet in the ruins walking though the old town  
Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around  
Oh it's enough to make you weep, all that remains of the main street  
Up in the park on Sunday, dogs chasing and the children played  
Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea  
In the afternoon, so nice to see you coming back in this town again  
  
Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man  
Came down on day when no-one was looking and it  
Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands  
Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells  
And nobody...helping no-one else  
Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through  
You'd better know what you're going through now  
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon  
  
That you don't recognize, evil destruction has taken everything  
You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking  
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance  
From the people you meet.  
  
Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes  
'Cause if smoke gets in them, baby you won't rise again.  
Where's it leading to freedom at what cost  
People needing more and more and it's all getting lost  
I want back, I want back  
Back to the time when the earth was green  
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean  
Don't stop that sun to shine, it's not yours or mine, no.


School is out now we're gonna have some fun.  
We're gonna make like we are the only ones.  
  
I'm gonna buy a piece of the sky  
And sell passin' clouds.  
I'm gonna be a mayor of some small town  
And tax the crowds.  
I'm gonna be a local surveyor  
And study the foreman's girl.  
I'm gonna line up some of the finest  
Girls that are in the world.  
  
We're comin' out of school today  
And we're so happy, yes, to be alive.  
It's gonna be the best day,  
The best day of our lives.  
  
I'm gonna be a history maker  
And call myself Richard the Third.  
I'm gonna buy an amplifier  
And shout out "Have you heard?"  
  
We're comin' out of school today  
And we're so happy, yes, to be alive.  
It's gonna be the best day,  
The best day of our lives.  
  
We're comin' out of school today, baby,  
We're comin' out of school today.  
Hey, comin' out of school today.  
Oh, out, out, School is out, a school is out, out.


Oh I'm on my way I know I am,  
Somewhere not so far from here  
All I know is all I feel right now,  
I feel the power growing in my hair  
  
Sitting on my own not by myself,  
Everybody's here with me  
I don't need to touch your face lo know,  
And I don't need to use my eyes to see  
  
I keep on wondering if I sleep too long,  
Will I always wake up the same (or so)?  
I keep on wondering if I sleep to long,  
Will I even wake up the same or something  
  
Oh I'm on my way I know I am,  
But times there were when thought not  
Bleeding half my soul in bad company,  
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop  
  
I'm not making love to anyone's wishes,  
Only for that light I see  
Cause when I'm dead and lowered low in my grave,  
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me  
  
And if I make it to the waterside,  
Will I even find me a boat (or so)?  
And I if I make it lo the waterside,  
I'll be sure to write you note or something  
  
Oh I'm on my way I know I am,  
Somewhere not so far from here  
All I know is all I feel right now,  
I feel the power growing In my hair  
  
Oh life is like a maze of doors  
And they all open from the side you're on  
Just keep on pushing hard boy, try as you may  
You're going to wind up where you started from  
You're going to wind up where you started from


Other people come and go  
They try to make it through  
I have to smile and tell them no  
Cause I only care for you  
I only care for you  
Yes, you are my sweet, sweet Jamaica  
Country mama, brown country girl  
When you touch me I, I feel so tall  
If you let me down boy I'd be so small  
Yes, you are my sweet Jamaica  
Country mama, brown country girl  
  
Everybody needs a friend  
To brighten up their world  
I know you'll never let me down  
Cause you're not that kind of girl, no no no  
  
I want to see you round every turn  
You're my world far as I'm concerned  
Got no time to runabout  
Just Want to spend my life out with you, only you  
Yes, you are my sweet, sweet Jamaica,  
Country mama, brown country girl  
Oh, yes you are  
Sweet Jamaica, oh brown country girl, ooh


Once she came into my room, feathered hat an' all  
Wearing a warm wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders  
Two eyes like lights, milky marble whites looking up at me  
Looking for a way, Moons in an endless day  
  
All I knew was with her then, no couldn't see the time  
As we drank down the wine to the last Sweet Scarlet  
How was I to wonder why or even question this  
Underneath her her kiss I was so unguarded  
Every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy  
  
She was so much younger then, wild like the wind  
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country  
but deep beneath her curls,  
Beneath this misty pearl, there was more to see  
  
She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife  
She cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted  
All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy  
  
Come let us drink again, before the second show  
I want you so to know there's no bridge between us  
All those gates have opened now, and through the light has shone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy


A gardener's daughter stopped me on my way, on the day I was to wed  
It is you who I wish to share my body with she said  
We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed  
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head.  
Her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun  
Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds on.  
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood  
And we walked 'till we came to where the holy magnolia stood.  
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love  
  
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.  
The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait I was sad but I had to go,  
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio.  
  
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around  
There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound  
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met  
'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget.  
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before  
As if was a year before  
  
Until the gift that someone left, a basket by my door.  
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed,  
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  
  
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe  
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before.  
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread  
I'll tell you everything I've learned, and Love is all, he said.


You say you want to seek the truth, but it's hard to find  
No one to help you, your friends don't have the time  
So you ride around in your car, switch on the radio  
You want to relate to something you once read in a book  
What kind of a way to try to take a look  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey  
Until I got hurt, 'til I got hurt, why didn't I  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry  
But the tears you shed are only in your eye  
So you turn to any phony mouth with a tale to tell  
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion  
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, I did not know what to do  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't [  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
Young son, don't let me down, young son  
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now  
Hold on, never let go, now hold on  
Turn your heart to the bright sun  
Love will come your way  
Cause 'till you make that final show  
You'll never know what love you've been missing  
Missing  
  
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone  
No one to help you and nobody to push you on  
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on  
You wait for a miracle, 'cause you say one day one'll come along  
( But wishful thinking, boy) any minute now ! You might be gone  
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I didn't know which way  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't I  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
Until I got hurt, oh I didn't know what love is


Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree  
An apple tree,  
  
Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree  
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked  
So he sent forth to hire me  
  
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea  
But a never in my traveling days  
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!  
  
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple  
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,  
For it will bring you down  
If it ever sees you wearing a frown  
  
So laugh, laugh a little apple  
Well all the apples were hidin'  
Frightened that they might be plucked  
And everytime that somebody passed  
All except that one little apple ducked  
  
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea  
But a never in my traveling days  
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!  
  
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple  
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,  
For it will bring you down  
If it ever sees you wearing a frown  
  
So laugh, laugh a little apple


He sleeps alone in the damp  
And rests his head upon a door  
The only bed he knows is the floor,  
  
The tramp  
Turned up collar and worn out shoes  
He doesn't care 'cause he hasn't got nothing to lose  
  
He sleeps alone in the damp  
And rests his head upon a door  
The only bed he knows is the floor,  
  
The tramp  
No companion to take him home  
His only friends are the kind that just leave him alone  
No one knows just how lonely his life has been  
In a world that lives in a dream  
  
He sleeps alone in the damp  
And rests his head upon a door  
The only bed he knows is the floor,  
  
The tramp


The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missing such a lot that could be yours  
  
Why can't I stop forgetting myself?  
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else  
Why can't I love you?  
Why bother flying high above you  
I know where you are  
  
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missin' such a lot that could be yours  
  
And who's going to miss me?  
There'll only be myself to blame  
You know I'd love to hold you tight  
And love you all the night  
But I don't even know my name  
  
La la la da la  
  
Why can't I stop forgetting myself?  
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else?  
Why can't I love you?  
Why bother flying high above you  
I know where you are  
  
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missin' such a lot that could be yours


Now that I've passed your test  
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down  
If I led you around, I'm sorry  
But I never meant to worry you...no  
Now that I've kissed your breast  
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad  
If I ever had , do believe your tears tears won't come back again  
I love you, though the stars may fade  
And mountains turn into sand. I love you  
'Til my body changes into an old man. I love you  
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain  
La la la la la la  
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead  
Anything that heaven can give you, I can give you instead  
La la la la la la  
How could I lie to you baby, I'll never lead you around  
I'll take care of everything you need, darling  
Every little need'll be found. I love you  
Thought the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea  
And I really only want you to want me. I love you  
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain  
Now that you've shown your heart  
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone  
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold  
And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby  
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love  
Flying on the power of love. I love you  
Though time may fade and mountains turn into sand  
I love you, 'til the very same come back to the land  
I love you and the song that I sing is the only way that  
I can explain  
Two fine people should love each other  
Two fine people should help each other


Thought I could define it  
One look in your eyes would have proved me wrong.  
I find myself speechless  
This feeling of completeness is so strong  
And now as convinced that my heart had reached it's limit  
Till you created this new place in it  
  
Your touch wraps around  
In love that knows no boundaries  
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
You're the answer I've been needing  
Life doesn't hold no meaning  
Now... All because of you  
  
Everything is different,  
There's no frame of reference for the way I feel  
Would you look at your face  
I'm still amazed, I can't believe you're real  
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep  
Hanging on every breath that you breathe  
  
Your touch wraps around  
In love that knows no boundaries  
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
You're the answer I've been needing  
Life doesn't hold no meaning  
Now... All because of you  
  
All Because Of You...  
Mmmmmm


When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And makin' love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
Livin' alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
But when I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't want to be, all by myself anymore  
All by myself  
Don't want to live, all by myself anymore  
  
Hard to be sure  
Some times I feel so insecure  
And love so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure


When somebody loves you  
It's no good unless he loves you all the way  
Happy to be near you  
When you need someone to cheer you all the way  
  
Taller than the tallest tree is  
That's how it's got to feel  
Deeper than the deep blue sea is  
That's how deep it goes if its real  
  
When somebody needs you  
It's no good unless he needs you all the way  
Through the good or lean years  
And for all the in between years, come what way  
  
Who know where the road will lead us  
Only a fool would say  
But if you'll let me love you  
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way, all the way


I hear the ticking of the clock  
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark  
I wonder where you are tonight  
No answer on the telephone  
And the night goes by so very slow  
Oh I hope that it won't end though  
Alone  
  
[Chorus]  
'Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
  
How do I get you alone  
  
You don't know how long I have wanted  
To touch your lips and hold you tight,oh  
You don't know how long I have waited  
And I was going to tell you tonight  
But the secret is still my own  
And my love for you is still unknown  
Alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
Alone, alone


I listen to my heartbeat and I  
Try to follow where it leads me, that's right.  
I don't wake up in the shadows anymore.  
I can finally breathe  
  
I dig a little deep down searching  
Took a little time to work it through  
But I found everything  
The day that I had you  
  
I once was the lost one  
Like a wayward child  
Now you're the light that leads the way  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
I'll fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
You'll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
It's a better world  
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl  
  
I'm picking up all the pieces  
When I put 'em back together I'm like new  
'Cause my greatest wish  
Has already come true  
  
We'll always be connected baby  
Like a button to a sleeve  
And this lullaby  
Will send you off to sleep  
  
It's hard to imagine  
My life before you  
'Cause you're the light that leads the way  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
I'll fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
You'll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
It's a better world  
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl  
  
I'll be holding the wrap if you come on and fall  
There is love after love after all  
  
We'll always be connected baby  
You're like a button on my sleeve  
And this lullaby , oh  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
I'll fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
You'll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
It's a better world  
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl  
Your girl


Sorry I know I'm late  
Guess I lost all track of time  
Started walking and couldn't stop turning it over in my mind  
Trying to make some sense of it  
Trying to make the pieces fit  
I thought I covered my tracks so well  
But now he says he knew about it from the start  
Yeah he knew about us all along...  
  
If there was any other way  
Don't you think I've tried to find it  
Don't you think I want to stay  
If there was any other way love  
There's no way out of this  
There just ain't any other way...  
  
Maybe I'd better be leaving now  
But there's something I want you to understand before I go  
Sometimes we don't have a choice when we play and break the rules  
I just had to see you darlin', one more time  
If only just to say good bye  
cause he knew about us all the time  
  
I never wanted to be like this  
I never meant to get serious  
But now the thought of losing you  
Takes some getting used to


I learned the truth at seventeen  
That love was meant for beauty queens  
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles  
Who married young and then retired  
  
The valentines I never knew  
The Friday night charades of youth  
Were spent on one more beautiful  
At seventeen I learned the truth  
  
And those of us with ravaged faces  
Lacking in the social graces  
Desperately remained at home  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Who called to say "Come dance with me"  
And murmured vague obscenities  
It isn't all it seems at seventeen  
  
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs  
Whose name I never could pronounce  
Said, "Pity, please, the ones who serve  
They only get what they deserve.  
The rich relationed hometown queen  
Marries into what she needs  
With a guarantee of company  
And haven for the elderly"  
  
So remember those who win the game  
Lose the love they sought to gain  
In debentures of quality  
And dubious integrity  
The small town eyes will gape at you  
In dull surprise when payment due  
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen  
  
To those of us who knew the pain  
Of valentines that never came  
And those whose names were never called  
When choosing sides for basketball  
It was long ago and far away  
The world was younger than today  
When dreams were all they gave for free  
To ugly ducking girls like me  
  
We all play the game and when we dare  
We cheat ourselves at solitaire  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Repenting other lives unknown  
That call and say, "Come dance with me"  
And murmur vague obscenities  
At ugly girls like me at seventeen


Ave Maria, Maiden mild  
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer  
For thou canst hear amid the wild  
'Tis thou, 'tis thou canst save amid, despair  
  
We slumber safely till the morrow  
Though we've by man outcast reviled  
Oh Maiden, see a maiden's sorrow  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child  
  
Ave Maria  
  
Ave Maria gratia plena  
Maria gratia plena  
Maria gratia plena  
Ave ave dominus, dominus tecum  
  
The murky cavern's air so heavy  
Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled  
Oh Maiden, hear a maiden pleadin'  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child  
  
Ave Maria  
Ave Maria


(Bizet)  
  
L'amour est un oiseau rebelle  
Que nul ne peut apprivoiser  
Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle  
C'est lui qu'on vient de nous refuser  
  
Rien n'y fait, menaces ou pri? Res  
L'un parle bien, l'autre se tait  
Et c'est l'autre que je pr? F? Re  
Il n'a rien dit mais il me pla? T  
  
L'amour, l'amour, l'amour, l'amour  
L'amour est enfant de boh? Me  
Il n'a jamais jamais connu de lois  
Si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime  
Si je t'aime prend garde? Toi  
Si tu ne m'aimes pas  
Si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime  
Mais si je t'aime, si je t'aime  
Prends garde? Toi  
  
L'oiseau que tu croyais surprendre  
Battit de l'aile et s'envola  
L'amour est loin, tu peux l'attendre  
Tu ne l'attends plus, il est l?  
  
Tout autour de toi, vite, vite  
Il vient, s'en va puis il revient  
Tu crois le tenir, il t'? Vite  
Tu crois l'? Viter, il te tient  
  
L'amour, l'amour, l'amour, l'amour  
L'amour est enfant de boh? Me  
Il n'a jamais jamais connu de lois  
Si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime  
Si je t'aime prend garde? Toi  
Si tu ne m'aimes pas  
Si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime  
Mais si je t'aime, si je t'aime  
Prends garde? Toi

Said the little lamb  
To the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the night  
Shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song  
High above the trees  
With a voice  
As big as the sea  
With a voice  
As big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy  
To the mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace warm  
Mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
A child  
A child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
  
Said the king  
To the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
Pray for peace  
People everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
A child, a child  
Sleeping in the night  
He will bring us  
Goodness and light  
He will bring us  
Goodness and light


Lyin' in my bed  
Thoughts in my head  
Visions of you  
But I can't get through the night  
  
So pick up the phone  
I know you're home  
You're playin' with my heart  
And you know that it just ain't right  
  
It's just a game of love, love, love  
And even though it's hard baby  
I can never give you up  
  
You're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for  
Inside  
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you  
  
So I get in the car  
But I didn't get far  
'Cause the radio played  
Every song that I sang with you  
  
Yesterday's gone  
And it may be true  
But you know that  
I'll never get over you  
  
It's just a game of love, love love  
And even though it hurts me baby  
I can never give you up  
  
'Cause you're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for  
Inside  
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you  
  
You, you gave me love  
Love gave us hope and strength  
To carry on and  
You, you gave me faith  
When I was fallin' down  
You would pick me up, my love  
  
You're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for  
Inside  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
You're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for  
Inside  
Baby  
I'm dreamin' of you


People are sayin'  
That boy is gonna hurt you  
His kind of love is not for real  
He's only playin'  
Foolin' with your heart girl  
But I know how he makes me feel  
And I don't need any other proof  
They just don't understand  
They don't know the truth  
Momma says he's bad for me  
Poppa says I'll be sorry  
Everybody's talkin' my baby down  
And all my friends doubt him  
Tell me I should live without him  
Everybody's talkin' my baby down  
  
He's not like the others  
Nobody wants to see it  
They don't even want to try  
  
Judge a book by its cover  
And you'll never know the story  
There's so much more than meets the eye  
Oh and I know his heart is true  
I don't need anyone  
To tell me what to do  
  
(chorus)  
My sisters and my brothers  
Tell me I should find another  
Everybody's talkin' my baby down  
  
Oh but they can't feel his touch  
They can't feel his kiss  
They don't know what it's like to be  
Loved like this  
I don't care about their point of view  
'Cause it's understood  
When the love is good  
Nothin' else is gonna do  
  
(chorus)  
No they don't know what he's all about  
Everybody just want to talk my baby down  
No they cant' see that his heart is gold  
Everybody want to treat my baby so cold,  
So cold  
  
(chorus)


I know that once in love  
You don't think of the devil who's inside  
And maybe it'll come one day  
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time  
  
You hear what you wanna hear  
Play it once I could disappear  
Some rules to the game of me  
Get it right for both of us  
  
Just say what you wanna say  
I've got it to give away  
We both wanna make it last  
So keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
  
It's not an illusion  
That you're the one  
And I have fallen deep  
I said it from the start  
When we're apart  
You must only think of me  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
  
And say that you want me  
Open up your heart  
Even if it's hard  
Say that you need me  
Then let him know  
Baby don't put on a show  
  
You say that you need me  
Tell him how you feel  
Let him know it's real  
And if you love me  
Never turn your back  
Gonna keep my eyes on him  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me


And in your eyes I see ribbons of color  
I see us inside of each other  
I feel my unconscious merge with yours  
And I hear a voice say, What's his is hers  
  
I'm falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
I was afraid to let you in here  
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear  
The walls begin to tumble down  
And I can't even see the ground  
  
I'm falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star  
Finding a belief, falling where you are  
  
Catch me, don't let me drop!  
Love me, don't ever stop!  
  
So close your eyes and let me kiss you  
And while you sleep I will miss you  
  
I'm falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star  
Finding a belief, falling where you are  
  
Falling into you  
Falling into you  
Falling into you  


Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago, that's right  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame"  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, "Oh Daddy, don't you dare"  
  
He gives me fever when he kisses me  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
"Oh daddy, won't you treat him right"  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Cats were born to give chicks fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever if you live and learn  
Fever 'til you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn


Fly, fly little wing  
Fly beyond imagining  
The softest cloud, the whitest dove  
Upon the wind of heaven's love  
Past the planets and the stars  
Leave this lonely world of ours  
Escape the sorrow and the pain  
And fly again  
  
Fly, fly precious one  
Your endless journey has begun  
Take your gentle happiness  
Far too beautiful for this  
Cross over to the other shore  
There is peace forevermore  
But hold this memory bittersweet  
Until we meet  
  
Fly, fly do not fear  
Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear  
Your heart is pure, your soul is free  
Be on your way, don't wait for me  
Above the universe you'll climb  
On beyond the hands of time  
The moon will rise, the sun will set  
But I won't forget  
  
Fly, fly little wing  
Fly where only angels sing  
Fly away, the time is right  
Go now, find the light


Forget me not  
Baby baby  
As I rock you gently  
Right here in my arms  
I promise to always  
Be here for you  
Keep you safe and warm  
  
Sometimes in the middle of the night  
I wake up cryin when I think of how long  
It took to find you  
And now that I have I won't be movin' on  
Nothing can ever separate us  
We know where we belong  
  
All I'm asking you  
All I'm asking  
Before this moments gone  
  
Forget me not  
Don't forget what we got  
Every day is surely but a dream  
I found the sweetest of all things  
For all my life  
You'll be my light  
With every beat that's in your heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Time is funny  
Time can fly  
That's one thing for sure  
I'll wake tomorrow  
Blink my eyes  
See you standin' at that door  
  
And I'll be lookin at you  
See the wonder of what love can be  
Someday I might have to let you go  
And that's just so hard to believe  
And if I do you'll know just  
How much you mean to me  
And all I'll ask of you  
All I'll ask you  
Before I set you free  
  
Forget me not  
Don't forget what we got  
Every day is surely but a dream  
I found the sweetest of all things  
For all my life  
You'll be my light  
With every beat that's in your heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Forget me not  
Forget me not  
Forget me  
  
Don't forget me baby  
Forget me  
Not  
Before I set you free yeah  
  
Forget me not  
Forget me  
Don't forget what we got  
What we got  
Every day is surely but a dream  
I found the sweetest of all things  
For ever more  
Connection  
I'll thee adore  
With every beat that's in your heart  
That's in my heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Don't forget what we got  
With every beat that's in your heart  
Oh baby please remember to  
Forget me not  
  
Not  
Forget me not

Mamma  
You gave life to me  
Turned a baby into a lady  
  
And mamma  
All you had to offer  
Was the promise of a lifetime of love  
  
Now I know  
There is no other  
Love like a mother's love for her child  
  
And I know  
A love so complete  
Someday must leave  
Must say goodbye  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
Mamma  
You gave love to me  
Turned a young one into a woman  
  
And mamma  
All I ever needed  
Was a guarantee of you loving me  
  
'Cause I know  
There is no other  
Love like a mother's love for her child  
  
And it hurts so  
That something so strong  
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
But the love you give will always live  
You'll always be there every time I fall  
You offered me the greatest love of all  
You take my weakness and you make me strong  
And I will always love you 'till forever comes  
  
And when you need me  
I'll be there for you always  
I'll be there your whole life through  
I'll be there this I promise you, mamma  
  
I'll be your beacon through the darkest nights  
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight  
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm  
And I will love you 'till forever comes  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
'Till we meet again...  
Until then...  
Goodbye


Come and go with me  
Wherever I am I want you to be  
Walking with your hand in mine  
Feel so fine  
  
When I'm close to you  
I know what it means to want to be true  
Never felt this way before  
Is there more  
  
Are you feeling the same as me honestly  
Don't you think it's unreal  
I'm not dealing in fairy tales  
If this fails  
I don't know what on earth I will do 'cause I'm  
Halfway to heaven  
Let's go all the way  
I don't want to give it up  
'Cause I'm already falling in love  
  
When we reach that place  
I'm dying to see the smile on your face  
I'm so sure you'll want to stay  
That's okay  
  
I have so many dreams to share  
Please be there  
Let me share them with you  
If you're looking for happiness nothing less  
Come with me, baby I'm looking too and I'm  
Halfway to heaven  
Let's go all the way  
I don't want to give it up  
'Cause I'm already falling now  
Halfway to heaven  
Let's go all the way  
I don't want to give it up  
'Cause I'm already falling in love  
  
I don't want to give my life in moderation (baby no)  
I'm prepared to give myself up to temptation it's time  
I could use a little love and inspiration (baby now)  
Come and share the joy and join the celebration  
It's time  
Hoping and praying that soon you'll be saying be mine  
  
I don't want to give it up  
I don't want to give it up  
'Cause I'm already falling in love  
You're makin' all my senses come alive  


Happy to meet you  
Happy to say hello  
You're someone  
I'd like to know  
That's very clear to see  
  
I'm happy to meet you  
Glad that you  
Wandered by  
No need to be too shy  
It's only you and me  
  
And though we don't  
Know each other very well  
Somehow it's not  
Too soon to tell  
Our friendship is  
Gonna grow  
Who knows how far  
It may go?  
  
Oh, so happy  
To meet you  
And as the days go by  
A possible you and I  
Will meet and then

To meet you

Somehow it's not  
Too soon to tell  
Our friendship is  
Gonna grow  
Who knows how far it may go?  
  
Oh, so happy  
To meet you  
And as the days go by  
A possible you and I  
Will meet and then  
We'll say happy  
To meet you  
Again and again

Without any fear  
And so this is christmas  
And what have we done  
Another year over  
A new one just begun  


Lying in bed alone  
Thinkin' bout how much I need you  
Oh give me one more chance  
To see you again  
  
If only I'd have known  
Was the last time I'd be with you  
I would have held on  
And never let you go  
  
Baby, just have a heart  
I'm begging you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby, just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Here comes another day  
I don't know if I can make it  
Oh, I've just realized  
Its so lonely being free  
  
Runnin' from the pain  
I'm never gonna shake it  
Oh how I need you  
To take it from me, baby  
  
Baby just have a heart  
I'm beggin' you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I always thought that I would have the  
Upper hand, but now I know that I'm  
Really not that strong  
If I could only make you understand  
I'd give you the world  
But for a start  
  
Baby just have a heart


To lead a better life  
I need my love to be here...  
  
Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with the wave of his hand  
Nobody can  
Deny that there's somethin' there  
  
There, running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there  
  
[Chorus]  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me  
I know I need never care  
But to love him is to need him everywhere  
Knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
  
I will be there... and everywhere  
Here, there and everywhere


(Duet with Il Divo)  
  
Lonely the path you have chosen  
A restless road, no turning back  
One day you will find your light again  
Don't you know  
Don't let go the chance  
  
Follow your heart  
Let your love lead through the darkness  
Back to a place you once knew  
I believe I believe I believe in you  
Follow your dreams  
Be yourself an angel of kindness  
There's nothing that you cannot do  
I believe I believe I believe in you  
  
Tous sais tu t'en iras tous sais  
Que vous??? ? L'univ? Re  
Ou suis ta qu? Te  
Sans regarder derri? Re  
N'attends pas  
Que le jour se l? Ve  
  
Suis ton? Toile  
Va jusqu'o? Ton are? Ve t'emporte  
Un jour tu le toucheras  
Si tu crois  
Si tu crois  
Si tu crois en toi  
  
Suis ta lumi? Re  
N'? Tint pas la flamme que tu portes  
Au fond de toi souviens toi  
Que je crois  
Que je crois  
Que je crois en toi  
  
Someday I'll find you  
Someday you'll find me too  
And when I hold you close  
I know that it's true  
  
Follow your heart  
Let your love lead through the darkness  
Back to a place you once knew  
I believe I believe I believe in you  
Follow your dreams  
Be yourself an angel of kindness  
There's nothing that you cannot do  
I believe I believe I believe in you


A mountain of stone a door of steel  
Can't stand in my way I'd go on  
Brutal machines unbending laws  
Can't slow me down I'd go on  
I've learned how to deal and when to fight  
I know what's real I know what's right  
I'm not afraid a wounded dove  
I can be tender in a world so tough  
  
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold  
But life without you I don't know  
  
The winds of the heart can blow me down  
But I get right up and I stand my ground  
I've tasted fear, my share of pain  
The wasted tears of love in vain  
I've held you tight, pushed you away  
Now with all my might I beg you to stay  
  
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold  
But life without you, I don't know  
  
I know what I want, I know what I need  
But there's just one thing I must believe  
Deep in the night by a dying flame  
You will be there when I call your name  
  
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold  
But life without you, I don't know  
  
I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know


I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel  
Maybe I should have called you first  
But I was dying to get to you  
I was dreaming while I drove  
The long straight road ahead  
Uh-huh, yeah  
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide  
This fever for you was just burning me up inside  
  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night crept in your room  
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night  
  
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?  
No matter where I go  
I hear the beating of our one heart  
I think about you when the nights is cold and dark  
Uh-huh, yeah  
No one can move me the way that you do  
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you  
  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night crept in your room  
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night  
  
I taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide  
This fever for you was just burning me up inside  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night crept in your room  
Is that all right?  
I drove all night


Anybody ever tell you that you're not whole  
A hollow shell of man without a soul  
Never ever felt your warmth cause you're always cold  
Only thing that makes sense is letting go  
  
Anybody ever tell you that you've got nerve  
Treatin' my love like just another word  
Tired of giving love to you that you don't deserve  
So this is one way of saying it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I got nothing left  
I got nothing left  
I got nothing left  
I gave you my best  
And you treated it worthless  
So I got nothing left  
  
Anybody ever tell you that you're gonna learn  
Trust and respect are two things you must earn  
When it came to lovin' me you just weren't concerned  
You never gave a damn so I guess now it's my turn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So done with you  
Maybe we're through  
So done with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So done with you  
So done with you


I'd like to run away from you  
But if I were to leave you I would die  
I'd like to break the chains you put  
Around me  
And yet I'll never try  
No matter what you do you drive me  
Crazy  
I'd rather be alone  
But then I know my life would be so  
Empty  
As soon as you were gone  
Impossible to live with you  
But I could never live without you  
For whatever you do  
For whatever you do  
  
I never, never, never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
You make me sad  
You make me strong  
You make me mad  
You make me long for you  
You make me long for you  
  
You make me live  
You make me die  
You make me laugh  
You make me cry for you  
You make me cry for you  
I hate you  
Then I love you  
Then I love you  
Then I hate you  
Then I love you more  
For whatever you do  
I never, never, never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
You treat me wrong  
You treat me right  
You let me be  
You make me fight with you  
I could never live without you  
  
You make me high  
You bring me down  
You set me free  
You hold me bound to you  
I hate you  
Then I love you  
Then I love you  
Then I hate you  
Then I love you more  
I love you more  
For whatever you do  
For whatever you do  
  
I never, never, never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
I never, never, never  
I never, never, never  
I never, never, never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
But you


I knew I loved you, before I knew you  
The hands of time would lead me to you  
An evening star, watched from afar  
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here  
  
Now wrapped in moonlight, at last together  
Here in the incandescent glow, we are all we need to know  
As we softly please each other 'til the stars and shadows glow  
And we sing with our dreams among us  
  
Ahhhhhhhh  
Ohhhhahhhhhhhh  
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here  
  
I knew I loved you, before I found you  
And you had built my world around you  
Now all my days, they're now my nights  
And my tomorrows will all begin and end..... with you  
  
Ooooooo


I was forgotten  
Until you called my name  
Lost in the shadows  
Until you shined your light my way  
Now I believe again  
In all my dreams again  
I'm wide eyed and innocent  
Those doubting days  
Are so far away and oh  
  
I will fall  
And you will catch me always  
Time has taught me this  
I will fly  
And you'll be there to guide me  
Straight up to my heart's highest wish  
I feel you close to me  
And I know what love is  
  
Now there's no mountain  
Too high for me to climb  
No ocean so wide  
That I could not reach the other side  
Now I believe in me  
Cause you live and breather in me  
And nothing can come between  
We are one star  
No nigh can darken, Oh  
  
I will fall  
And you will catch me always  
Time has taught me this  
I will fly  
And you'll be there to guide me  
Straight up to my heart's highest wish  
I feel you close to me  
And I know what love is  
  
It's an unspoken thing  
A quiet opening  
There are no words that can go that deep  
But I know  
I know  
  
I will fall  
And you will catch me always  
Time has taught me this  
I will fly  
And you'll be there to guide me  
Straight up to my heart's highest wish  
I feel you close to me  
And I know what love is


I must be crazy now  
Maybe I dream too much  
But when I think of you  
I long to feel your touch  
  
To whisper in your ear  
Words that are old as time  
Words only you would hear  
If only you were mine  
  
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you  
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes  
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do  
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side  
  
I love you, please say  
You love me too, these three words  
They could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
Till the end of time  
  
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside  
Just to walk right up to your door  
But my body can't move when I finally get to it  
Just like a thousand times before  
  
Then without a word he handed me this letter  
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said  
I love you, please say  
You love me too, these three words  
They could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
Till the end of time  
  
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah  
And maybe I, I need a little care  
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you  
Oh you need somebody just to hold you  
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there  
  
I love you, please say  
You love me too  
Please say you love me too  
Till the end of time  
These three words  
They could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
  
Oh, I love you  
Please say you love me too  
Please please  
Say you love me too  
Till the end of time  
My baby  
Together, together, forever  
Till the end of time  
I love you  
I will be your light  
Shining bright  
Shining through your eyes  
My baby


Wish I could be the one  
The one who could give you love  
The kind of love you really need  
  
That I'll always stay with you  
But baby that's not me  
You need someone willing to give their heart and soul to you  
Promise you forever, baby that's something I can't do  
  
Oh I could say that I'll be all you need  
But that would be a lie  
I know I'd only hurt you  
I know I'd only make you cry  
  
I'm not the one you're needing  
I love you, goodbye  
  
I hope someday you can  
Find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you  
I don't really want to go  
But deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do  
  
You'll find someone who'll be the one that I could never be  
Who'll give you something better  
Than the love you'll find with me  
Oh I could say that I'll be all you need  
  
But that would be a crime  
I know I'd only hurt you  
I know I'd only make you cry  
I'm not the one you're needing  
I love you, goodbye  
  
Leaving someone when you love someone  
Is the hardest thing to do  
When you love someone as much as I love you  
  
Oh I don't want to leave you  
Baby it tears me up inside  
But I'll never be the one you're needing  
I love you, goodbye  
  
Baby, its never goin' work out  
I love you, goodbye


Ooh Baby, hmmm  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and it's here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on Christmas day  
Twentyfourth of December  
It was a cold and snowing night  
I still can remember Gazing at the stars and the moonlight  
Fell asleep on a sofabed  
Dreams of Christmas in my head  
But I woke up to my surprise  
There he was right in front of my eyes  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and it's here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on Christmas day  
I was stuffing the stockings  
And hanging tincel on the tree  
When I heard him knocking  
I opened the door in time to see  
Carollers sing "Silver Bells"  
I saw his face, that's when I fell  
He was there bent on one knee  
Santa sent him just for me  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and it's here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on a Christmas day  
Yeah, yeah  
And I know this love will grow  
When flowers bloom in early spring  
I'll be his bride  
I'll wear his ring  
So if your looking for an angel who,  
Is gonna make your every dream come true  
Just write a letter saying Santa hey,  
I'll need an angel next Christmas day'  
Yeah  
Yeah, yeah baby  
Ooh  
Ding, ding, dong, ding  
Listen up what I got to say, hey  
I found true love and it's here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring and ring in me  
I met an angel on a Christmas day  
Ooh, listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and it's here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring  
Chapel bells are gonna ring  
I met an angel on a Christmas day  
Listen up to what I got to say  
True love and it's on its way  
I met an angel on a Christmas day  
Yeah  
On a Christmas day  
Ooh  
Ooh baby  


I remember L.A.  
Seems a lifetime ago  
We were stars on Sunset Boulevard  
What a movie we made  
  
There were days in the sun  
That have stayed forever young  
Nights when passion was invincible  
We thought love would never die  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There were moments in that lifetime  
That my heart still replays  
There were minutes there were hours there were days  
There are moments I still love you that same way  
When I remember L.A.  
  
I remember goodbye  
I watched your plane out of sight  
Love was over, time to close the book  
Still I go back for one last look  
  
[Chorus]


There's so much life I've left to live  
And this fire is burning still  
When I watch you look at me  
I think I could find the will  
To stand for every dream  
And forsake this solid ground  
And give up this fear within  
Of what would happen if they ever knew  
I'm in love with you  
  
'Cause I'd surrender everything  
To feel the chance to live again  
I reach to you  
I know you can feel it too  
We'd make it through  
A thousand dreams I still believe  
I'd make you give them all to me  
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go  
I surrender  
  
I know I can't survive  
Another night away from you  
You're the reason I go on  
And now I need to live the truth  
Right now, there's no better time  
From this fear I will break free  
And I'll live again with love  
And no they can't take that away from me  
And they will see...  
  
I'd surrender everything  
To feel the chance to live again  
I reach to you  
I know you can feel it too  
We'd make it through  
A thousand dreams I still believe  
I'd make you give them all to me  
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go  
I surrender  
  
Every night's getting longer  
And this fire is getting stronger, baby  
I'll swallow my pride and I'll be alive  
Can't you hear my call  
I surrender all  
  
I'd surrender everything  
To feel the chance to live again  
I reach to you  
I know you can feel it too  
We'll make it through  
A thousand dreams I still believe  
I'll make you give them all to me  
I'll hold you in my arms and never let go  
I surrender  
  
Right here, right now  
I give my life to live again  
I'll break free, take me  
My everything, I surrender all to you  
  
Right now  
I give my life to live again  
I'll break free, take me  
My everything, I surrender all to you


I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes  
I want to be the touch you need every single night  
I want to be your fantasy  
And be your reality  
  
And everything between  
I want you to need me  
Like the air you breathe  
I want you to feel me  
  
In everything  
I want you to see me  
In your every dream  
The way that I taste you,feel you,breathe you,need you  
  
I want you to need me,need me  
Like I need you  
I want to be the eyes that look deep into your soul  
I want to be the world to you I just want it all  
  
I want to be your deepest kiss  
The answer to your every wish  
And all you ever need  
I want you to need me  
  
Like the air you breathe  
I want you to feel me  
In everything  
I want you to see me  
  
In your every dream  
The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you  
I want you to need me,need me  
'Cause I need you more then you could know  
  
And I need you to never never let me go  
And I need to be deep inside your heart  
I just want to be everywhere you are  
I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes  
  
I want to be the touch you need every single night  
I want to be your fantasy  
And be your reality  
And everything between  
  
I want you to need me  
Like the air you breathe  
I want you to feel me  
In everything  
  
I want you to see me  
In your every dream  
'Cause baby I taste you,feel you,breathe you,need you  
I want you to need me  
  
Like the air you breathe  
I want you to feel me  
In your everything  
I want you to see me  
  
In your every dream  
'Cause baby I taste you,feel you,breathe you,need you  
I want you to need me,need me  
Like I need you


You're the bravest of hearts you're the strongest of souls  
You're my light in the dark you're the place I call home  
You can say it's all right but I know that you're breaking up inside  
I see it in your eyes  
Even you face the night afraid and alone  
That's why I'll be there  
  
When the storm rises up when the shadows descend  
Every beat of my heart every day without end  
Every second I live that's the promise I make  
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes  
If that's what it takes  
  
You can sleep in my arms, you don't have to explain  
When your heart's crying out, baby, whisper my name  
'Cause I've reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above  
You've given me your love  
When your smile like the sun that shines through the pain  
That's why I'll be there  
  
When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend  
Every beat of my heart, every day without end  
I will stand like a rock, I will bend till I break  
'Til there's no more to give, if that's what it takes  
I will risk everything, I will fight, I will bleed  
I will lay down my life, if that's what you need  
Every second I live, that's the promise I make  
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes  
  
Through the wind and the rain, through the smoke and the fire  
When the fear rises up, when the wave's ever higher  
I will lay down my heart, my body, my soul  
I will hold on all night and never let go  
Every second I live, that's the promise I make  
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes  
  
If that's what it takes  
Every day  
If that's what it takes  
Every day


Can you keep a secret?  
Come on, ohhhh  
These walls keep a secret  
That only we know  
But how long can they keep it  
Cause we're two lovers who lose control  
We're two shadows chasing rainbows  
Behind closed windows  
Behind closed doors  
  
If walls could talk-oh  
They would say "I want you more"  
They would say "Hey, never felt like  
This before"  
And that you would always be the one for me  
Just two people making memories  
Too good to tell  
And these arms are never empty  
When we're lying where we fall  
We're painting pictures, making magic  
Taking chances,  
Making love  
  
If walls could talk-oh  
They would say "I want you more"  
They would say "Hey, never felt like  
This before"  
And that you would always be the one for me  
  
If walls had eyes, my  
They would see the love inside  
They would see me  
In your arms in ecstasy  
And with every move they'd know  
I love you so  
  
When I'm feeling weak  
YOu give me wings  
When the fire has no heat  
You light it up again  
When I hear no violins  
You play my every string  
  
So stop the press  
Hold the news  
The secret's safe between me and you  
Walls, can you keep a secret?  
  
If calls could talk, oh  
They would say "I want you more"  
They would say "Hey, never felt like  
This before"  
And that you would always be  
The one for me  
  
If walls had eyes, my  
They would see the love inside  
They would see, me  
In your arms in ecstasy  
And with every move they'd know  
I love you so


Mmmm  
I get wings to fly  
Oh, I'm alive  
  
When you call on me  
When I hear you breath  
I get wings to fly  
I feel that I'm alive  
  
When you look at me  
I can touch the sky  
I know that I'm alive  
  
When you bless the day  
I just drift away  
All my worries die  
I'm glad that I'm alive  
  
You've set my heart on fire  
Filled me with love  
Made me a woman on clouds above  
  
I couldn't get much higher  
My spirit takes flight  
Cause I'm alive  
  
(When you call on me)  
When you call on me  
(When I hear you breath)  
When I hear you breath  
I get wings to fly  
I feel that I'm alive  
I am alive  
  
(When you reach for me)  
When you reach for me  
Raising spirits high  
God knows that  
  
That I'll be the one  
Standing by  
  
Through good and through trying times  
  
And it's only begun  
I can't wait for the rest of my life  
  
(When you call on me)  
When you call on me  
(When you reach for me)  
When you reach for me  
I get wings to fly  
I feel that  
  
(When you bless the day)  
When you bless, you bless the day  
(I just drift away) I just drift away  
All my worries die  
I know that I am alive, yeah  
  
I get wings to fly, God knows that I am alive


So this is who I am  
And this is all I know  
And I must choose to live  
For all that I can give  
The spark that makes the power grow  
  
And I will stand for my dream if I can  
Symbol of my faith in who I am  
But you are my only  
And I must follow on the road, that lies ahead  
And I won't let my heart control my head  
But you are my only  
And we don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
And I know what I've got to be  
  
Immortality  
I make my journey through eternity  
I keep the memory of you and me  
Inside  
  
Fulfill your destiny  
Is there within the child  
My storm will never end  
My fate is on the wind  
The king of hearts, the joker's wild  
We don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
I'll make them all remember me  
  
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true  
Every ounce of me must see it through  
But you are my only  
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way  
I will make them give to me  
  
Immortality  
There is a vision and a fire in me  
I keep the memory of you and me, inside  
And we don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
  
With all my love for you  
And what else we may do  
We don't say, goodbye


Forgive me  
Don't know where to start  
I guess we've come to  
The serious part  
I need to find out  
If there's a chance  
For us?  
  
Don't give me that same old look  
It won't win me over  
Don't give me that same old speech  
You don't have to speak at all  
  
You can say you love me  
That I'm your perfect crush  
How it hurts to need someone that much  
You can swear you mean it  
But that ain't good enough  
'cause when a man loves a woman it is all  
In his touch  
  
I wish you could you see (yeah)  
Just how simple  
It's supposed to be  
  
Cause now that we've come this far  
We don't want to loose it  
If you want to win my heart  
Baby just shut your mouth  
  
You can say you love me  
That I'm your perfect crush  
How it hurts to need someone that much  
You can swear you mean it  
But that ain't good enough  
'Cause when a man loves a woman it is all  
In his touch?  
  
Then words don't mean that much


there's a tree  
standing there  
in such an ordinary way  
but as I look around  
everything keeps changing  
there's a leaf  
on that tree  
and it floats into a stream  
and like everything  
it gets carried away  
to the sea...  
(chorus)  
but if we give a little of our love away  
maybe meet in the middle  
every night and day  
if we could hear just a whisper  
of what the heart needs to say  
it could sure make a difference  
in some small...  
in some small way  
in your heart lies the key  
that unlocks your destiny  
look within and we'll find  
everything we're longing for  
(chorus)  
oh...  
may you cherish each moment you live  
and know all the love that you give  
will go on and on and on...  
there's a sky vast and blue  
and it lies deep inside of you  
breathe it in  
let it out  
breathe it in again...  
(chorus)


Dans mes absences parfois sans doute  
J'aurais pu m'? Loigner  
Comme si j'avais perdu ma route  
Comme si j'avais chang?  
Alors j'ai quelques mots tendresse  
Juste pour le dire Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous? Tes au creux de moi  
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais  
Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are? Ves  
Sont venus avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous savez tant de moi  
De ma vie, de tout ce que j'en fais  
Alors mes bonheurs, mes d? Chirures  
Se partagent avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
  
Parce que le temps peut mettre en cage  
Nos are? Ves et nos envies  
Je fais mes choix et mes voyages  
Parfois j'en paie le prix  
La vie me sourit ou me blesse  
Mais quelle que soit ma vie  
  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous? Tes au creux de moi  
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais  
Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are? Ves  
Sont venus avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
  
M? Me? L'autre bout de la terre  
Je continue mon histoire avec vous  
  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous? Tes au creux de moi  
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais  
Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are? Ves  
Sont venus avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous savez tant de moi  
De ma vie, de tout ce que j'en fais  
Alors mes bonheurs, mes d? Chirures  
Se partagent avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas


Just a little bit of love  
I was alone, I was afraid  
I couldn't face another day of pain in my life oh oh oh  
I called your name and you were there  
Just like an answer to a prayer  
You made it all right oh yeah  
  
So I give my heart  
And I give my soul to you oh I do  
And now I know  
I know I found the truth oh hey  
  
Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it  
Around, and around, and around, oh yeah  
  
I found the truth I found the way  
I'm standing in the light of day  
I got the power  
I'm not worried any longer  
No I'm only getting stronger by the hour  
  
You can move a mountain  
Or calm the stormy sea  
There's no doubt about it  
I truly do believe  
  
Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit love's gonna turn it  
Around, around, and around, oh yeah  
  
Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it  
Around, and around, and around, oh yeah  
  
And it can free your mind  
Yes it can free your soul  
Yes it can free your mind  
And it can free your soul  
  
Free your soul let it go let it go  
Just a little bit of love just a little bit of love  
Yeah  
  
Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it  
Around, and around, and around, oh yeah  
  
Just a little bit of love's gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of love's gonna turn it  
Around, and around, and around, oh yeah


La do do la do  
Deux doigts sur un piano  
Ce vieux piano a bon dos  
Me suivre dans mes reves  
Ce n'est pas de tout repos  
  
La do do la do  
Two fingers on a piano  
This old piano is still good  
Following me in my dreams  
Is not an easy task  
Sur les touches noires  
Je mets mon desespoir  
Ou bien je gare  
Mes problemes  
  
On the black keys  
I put my despair  
Or I park  
My problems  
see'est sur les touches blanches  
Que je range  
Mes (Je t'aime)  
  
It's on the white keys  
That I put  
My "I love you"  
Alors ce piano-la  
Ne sait plus ou il va  
Il pleure ou bien il rit  
Ou les deux a la fois  
Il fait des tremolos  
Il est juste il est faux  
  
So this piano  
Don't know where it's going  
It cries or it laughes  
Or both at the same time  
It makes tremolos  
It's exact it's false  
Il melange tout  
Le pire et le meilleur  
Il colle bout a bout  
Mineur et puis majeur  
Il cogne un peu trop fort  
Et se trompe d'accord  
  
It mixes up everything  
The best and the worst  
It glues end to end  
Minor and then major  
It hits a bit too hard  
And doesn't do the right pitch  
La do do la do  
Je joue pianissimo  
En revant d'un inconnu  
Qui pour la vie entiere  
Me fera faire  
Un pas de plus  
  
La do do la do  
I play piannissimo  
Dreaming of a stranger  
Who for a lifetime  
Will make me make  
One more step  
Je n'ai que deux mains  
Mais l'air que j'aime bien  
Ne se joue qu'a quatre mains  
Mais pourvu qu'il existe  
Le pianiste  
Que j'attends  
  
I only have two hands  
But the music I like much  
Only plays with four hands  
But so long as exist  
This pianist  
I'm waiting for  
Sinon ce piano-la  
Ne sait plus ou il va  
Il pleure ou bien il rit  
Ou les deux a la fois  
Il fait des tremolos  
Il est juste il est faux  
  
If not this piano  
Don't know where it's going  
It cries or it laughes  
Or both at the same time  
It makes tremolos  
It's exact it's false  
En attendant qu'il vienne  
Cet air que je compose  
Ne risque pas de faire  
Trembler (La vie en rose)  
Et pourtant je suis fiere  
D'avoir fait sur son nom  
Cette drole de chanson  
  
Waiting for him to arrive  
This music I create  
Don't have a chance to  
Make shiver (La vie en rose)  
But I'm proud  
To have done on its name  
This strange song  
Drole de chanson  
Cette drole de chanson  
  
Strange song  
This strange song


Meme a genoux, meme en priere  
Elle se souvient de l'Italie  
Jesus Marie et notre Pere  
see'est peu vous dire qu'elle vous oublie  
  
De l'autre cote de l'enfer  
Elle se souvient d'avoir dit oui  
A la passion a la lumiere  
A l'amour fou a l'infini  
  
Et prier cet homme sur la croix  
see'est encore se donner a lui  
Et quand lui viennent ces idees la  
see'est a peine si elle en rougit  
La religieuse a comme moi  
Des nuits d'amour en nostalgie  
La religieuse a quelques fois  
Des sanglots longs de jalousie  
  
Meme a genoux meme en priere  
Elle entend sa voix qui l'appelle  
Elle voit des bateaux sur la mer  
Elle revoit des chambres d'hotel  
  
De l'autre cote de ce mur  
Il why a le soleil de la vie  
Il why a des levres qui murmurent  
A des levres assoiffees d'envie  
  
Et prier cet homme sur la croix  
see'est encore se donner a lui  
Et quand lui viennent ces idees la  
see'est a peine si elle en rougit  
La religieuse a comme moi  
Des nuits d'amour en nostalgie  
La religieuse a quelques fois  
Des sanglots longs de jalousie  
  
Meme a genoux meme en priere  
Elle a des frissons de desir  
Tellement de sorciers l'ensorcellent  
Que le diable why prend do plaisir  
  
Elle a beau nouer ses cheveux  
Sous une cornette anonyme  
Elle ne sait pas baisser les yeux  
La peur do mal l'enfeminine  
  
Et prier cet homme sur la croix  
see'est encore se donner a lui  
Et quand lui viennent ces idees la  
see'est a peine si elle en rougit  
La religieuse a comme moi  
Des nuits d'amour en nostalgie  
La religieuse a quelques fois  
Des sanglots longs de jalousie

(1) c'qui: Contraction de "ce qui"


(C. Gaudette, A. Scott)  
  
Look at you baby  
The picture of a broken man  
Your confidence is shaken  
The world caved in on you again  
But I know what to do to ease the pain  
And bring you back to life again  
  
(Chorus I)  
A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is really all you need  
When life gets tough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
  
Oh baby hold me  
Let all that anger disappear  
A little smile is showing  
Something's catching fire here  
And when the morning comes you'll be good as new  
You'll take this night that we've shared with you  
  
(Chorus ii)  
A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is really all you need  
When life gets tough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is stronger than anything  
Words ain't enough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
  
[Bridge:] You've done it before, you'll do it again  
Get up off the floor, and jump right back in  
Baby, I still believe in you  
And we'll see this through  
'Cause true love is on our side  
  
(Breakdown)  
A little bit, a little bit  
  
(Solo)  
  
(Chorus iii)  
A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is really all you need  
When life gets tough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Can go a long way sometimes  
A little bit of love  
Is really all you need  
When life gets tough you need  
A little bit of love sometimes  
A little bit of love


I was walking stuck inside my head  
I couldn't get out  
Turn the lights down  
The voices inside are so loud.  
  
Need a jump start  
Catatonia  
I couldn't feel, I wish that I could disappear  
The voices inside are so real.  
  
But you stood by my side.  
Night after night, night after night.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
Back to life, back to life,  
Back to life, back to life, yeah  
  
You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive  
You loved me back to life,  
Back to life, thought I died.  
The voices inside were so quiet.  
  
But you stood by my side  
Night after night, night after night  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
  
Strong hands, thick skin, and an open heart  
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask  
You never gave up on me, yeah  
  
Life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight  
  
Back to life, back to life,  
back to life, back to life  
Back to life, back to life,  
back to life, back to life, yeah


I know some lovers would be satisfied  
With sweet "I Love You's" and some pretty lines  
But that won't get you in this heart of mine  
No you'll never steal my heart away  
With just words sweet words that you say  
It's all in the things that you do  
I'm telling you  
  
If you want me to believe  
That I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof  
I need lovin' proof  
Baby hold me in your arms  
And show me something from the heart  
Give me lovin' proof  
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby  
  
And if the love you got is strong and true  
And if you love me like you say you do  
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth  
And your kiss can never tell a lie  
'Cause I'd see it in your eyes  
There's one way to ease any doubt  
I tell you now  
  
If you want me to believe  
That I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof  
Baby I won't be impressed  
Unless I get some tenderness  
Give me lovin' proof  
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby  
  
(I need lovin' proof)  
If the love is right  
(I need lovin' proof)  
Prove it to me all night  
(I need lovin' proof)  
From you  
'Cause you'll never steal my heart away  
With just words sweet words that you say  
It's all in the things that you do  
I'm telling you, telling you baby


Goodnight, my angel, time to close your eyes  
And save these questions for another day  
I think I know what you've been asking me  
I think you know what I've been trying to say  
I promised I would never leave you  
Then you should always know  
Wherever you may go, no matter where you are  
I never will be far away  
  
Goodnight, my angel, now it's time to sleep  
And still so many things I want to say  
Remember all the songs you sang for me  
When we went sailing on an emerald bay  
And like a boat out on the ocean  
I'm rocking you to sleep  
The water's dark and deep, inside this ancient heart  
You'll always be a part of me  
  
Goodnight, my angel, now it's time to dream  
And dream how wonderful your life will be  
Someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby  
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me  
Someday we'll all be gone  
But lullabys go on and on  
They never die  
That's how you and I will be


No more sadness  
I wanna be the one to make you happy  
I wanna be the one to give you hope  
But in these days of conscious living  
We've got to take it slow  
You can't be sure of who you've met  
You just don't know what you might get  
Cause in these crazy times we're living  
Love can turn into regret  
  
But you, could be the one to change my point of view  
It's all up to you  
  
Give you love without the pain  
Show you light beyond the rain  
Gonna make you happy  
Gonna make you happy now  
There'll be days when things go wrong  
I'll be there to make you strong  
Gonna make you happy  
Gonna make you happy  
  
I wanna find a place where dreams can happen  
I wanna find a love who'll take me there  
And in your eyes I see a vision  
That makes me want to care  
And if two people both agree  
That only love can set them free  
Then together let us make a world  
Of which others only dream  
  
And you can be the one to make it all come true  
So what you gonna do  
  
I'll give you love without the pain  
Show you light beyond the rain  
Gonna make you happy  
Gonna make you happy now  
There'll be days when things go wrong  
I'll be there to keep you strong  
Gonna make you happy, Make you happy now  
Some days the sun don't wanna shine  
And I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
Gonna make you happy, happy

La maison a ferm? Ses yeux

Je ne reviendrai plus jamais

Oh Mamy Oh Mamy Mamy Blue  
Oh Mamy Blue


you're my life's one miracle  
everything I've done that's good  
and you break my heart with tenderness  
and I confess it's true  
I never knew a love like this 'til you  
you're the reason I was born  
now I finally know for sure  
and I'm overwhelmed with happiness  
so blessed to hold you close  
the one that I love most  
though the future has so much for you in store  
who could ever love you more?  
the nearest thing to heaven  
you're my angel from above  
only God creates such perfect love  
when you smile at me, I cry  
and to save your life I'd die  
with a romance that is pure in heart  
you are my dearest part  
whatever it requires  
I live for your desires  
forget my own, your needs will come before  
who could ever love you more?  
there is nothing you could ever do  
to make me stop loving you  
and every breath I take  
is always for your sake  
you sleep inside my dreams and know for sure  
who could ever love you more?


I thought I knew you  
Thought that I knew you well  
We had a rhythm  
But I guess you never can tell  
  
Oh I learned early  
Never to ignore the signs  
You'll be forgiven  
It ain't worth that much to my mind  
  
Lovin' you so easy  
It's hard to say goodbye  
But if it's the way it goes it goes  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think you're in my head  
You been seriously misled  
  
Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five  
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive  
I'm not somebody who commits the crime  
And leaves the scene  
But when I've been dissed  
I don't spend much time on what might've been  
I'm not about self-pity  
Your love did me wrong  
So I'm movin', movin' on  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think you're in my head  
You been seriously misled


It's a losing game I play  
In a dog eat dog, show biz town  
I've got a dream of my own  
And I carry my own weight  
But still they try to drag me down  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a woman in a man's world  
I'm a woman in a man's world  
  
So I'm fool enough to say  
That a woman's place is in the home  
Working twice as hard  
For the same reward as any man, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For my very own  
It'll make me strong if I don't give in  
Cause the harder the fight  
Oh, the sweeter the prize I'm sure to win


All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
Take my lips  
I never use them  
Take my arms  
I want to lose them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me  
  
All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
Take my lips  
I want to lose them  
Take my heart  
I'll never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me


Baby, there's something I like about you  
You make me feel so wild and free  
I don't know what you've been through  
You're just crazy enough for me  
And when you touch me I come undone  
Do you do that to everyone?  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby me, I'll baby you  
I know that you're a big baby too  
This world is crazy, you need someone to coo  
Baby me and I'll baby you  
Ooh, I'll baby you  
  
It's past my bedtime, I can't sleep alone  
Lay down beside me, I'll pull out the phone  
Take me in your arms and rock me tonight  
I'll tell you a story if you hold me tight  
Cause when you touch me I come undone  
You better not do that to everyone!


Big brown bedroom eyes  
They're bad for me  
Reluctantly you hit me  
To my vulnerability  
I don't like this feeling  
'Cause I can't see straight  
Something says I met my match  
Courtesy of fate  
  
I've always taken pride  
In my independence  
So afraid and careful  
Not to show it  
No - but you give me clarity  
Like a bright green laser beam  
I think you want what's best for me  
In spite of my resistance  
  
Be my eyes  
Sing me, I'm your song  
Make me wise, baby  
I'll be strong  
  
Constantly the ones we love scorn us  
It's not for them to comprehend  
It's none of their business  
Misery loves company  
  
I think you really know me  
And there's no coincidence  
My mama must have made me  
So we would find each other


Don't let them get the best  
Of your heart leave the rest  
Up to love and you'll be takin care of  
  
Many come to try to tear away your heart  
Never carin' for you from the very start  
Still you wonder if this time could be real  
Tryin' to figure out if they came just to steal  
  
Don't let them get the best  
Of your heart leave the rest  
Up to love and you'll be takin care of  
  
Time and time again you've listened to a smile  
Never knowin' what's behind it all the while  
You give yourself away until love is gone  
And don't consider that they might be doin' harm  
  
Don't let them get the best  
Of your heart leave the rest  
Up to love and you'll be takin care of  
  
Hey there, you let him wipe away that little tear  
You tryin so hard to hold back what you really feel  
Always look inside the people that your with  
And never hang around those who can not give


Chorus:  
I betcha I  
Betcha I can  
Betcha I can love  
Betcha I can love ya  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before  
  
Betcha I, Betcha I, Betcha I (2x)  
  
I betcha I can woo ya  
Betcha I can do ya  
Betcha I can do you till you're dead and done  
Betcha I can love ya  
Betcha I can hold ya  
So doncha know that I'm the only one  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before  
  
I betcha I can feed ya  
Betcha I can bleed ya  
And make you think you're havin' fun  
Betcha I can choose ya  
Betcha I can lose ya  
I betcha I can drop you like a smokin' gun  
  
Betcha I can tease ya  
Betcha I can freeze ya  
Betcha I can warm you like the mornin' sun  
Betcha I can flirt ya  
Betcha I can hurt ya  
Betcha I can do ya till you're dead and done  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before  
  
Chorus  
  
I betcha I can hold you  
Betcha I can mold you  
Betcha I can take you or leave you alone  
Betcha I can kiss you  
Don't you know that I can dismiss you  
And you're dismissed now  
Like a rolling stone  
And how does it feel?  
  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before


It's not the way you smile that makes me realize  
I think I love you  
It just might be that all my life I've been searchin' for  
Someone just like you  
  
Takin' my time  
Everything's fine  
I call you by the phone  
Nobody's home  
  
We've got better days  
There'll be better days  
We've got better days  
Yeah  
  
I don't know why but I wanna cry  
Every time you touch me  
I've givin' up, just can't help it  
In your arms is where I'd rather be  
  
I just can't hide it  
So I decided to give  
Stored away, I've got the strength to live  
  
There'll be better days  
We've got better days  
There'll be better days  
Yeah  
  
Better days, better days  
(repeat)


We thought we could do it without love  
Kept tellin' ourselves that here's where it ends  
Your way is my way and it's shown  
Something that we never admit  
  
In changin' the way I was feeling  
Only love and joy makes it right  
Feel first, and love lasts forever  
I'll do it with you if that's what you like  
  
CHORUS:  
  
Better when we do it together  
Can't leave it alone  
Good things get away  
All the other ways we've gone don't matter  
Can't leave it alone  
Good things get away  
  
Remember when happy was with us  
And all his dreams were sung  
Such things are forgotten thereafter  
'Cause we had to go on with the show  
  
Things, different places, adventure, makin' love  
'Cause love was the way  
Golden exchange, lots of money  
And the best of it all at our feet


Blue love, why'd you have to go and make me sad and blue  
Love, you're the only one I gave it to and  
  
You can't believe that I'm dying for you  
Can't you see I've been trying for you  
I just can't stop this crying for you, ooh-ooh  
  
They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to  
  
Blue love, who could ever think that you would be untrue  
Love, I'll do anything you want me to 'cause  
  
You can't believe that I'm trying for you  
Can't you see I've been crying for you  
I just can't stop this crying for you, oh you  
  
They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to blue  
  
Tony:  
I been hanging on such a long, long time  
Waiting for the return of your smiling face  
Chaka:  
And the test and the time that changed every mind can't you see  
That my world is an unhappy place  
Tony:  
Oh this love in my heart is tearing me apart  
Chaka:  
Need ya here wit me how happy we could be  
Tony:  
Together  
Chaka:  
Us forever  
  
They say you never know love until somebody leaves you  
You never know love until your baby leaves you  
You never know love until your loves turns to blue


Suspicions rising, answers aren't clear  
I thought we made a promise, now you've disappeared  
You seem to lead two lives at a time  
Do I still fit in, I thought you were mine  
Sitting at the bar in our favorite cafe  
I turn and see ya laughin' with her and your smile fades away  
Didn't surprise me, there's nothin' left to say  
I caught you red-handed now and you can't walk away  
CHORUS:  
You were caught in the act  
When you thought I wasn't lookin' at ya  
C.I.T.A., I can see what you're doin'  
Caught in the act, and I can't stand to hear your lies  
Caught in the act, don't you try and change my mind  
You called me the only, you said, "she's only a friend"  
Don't pretend you're sorry, my heart will mend  
Don't you come back to me, don't you try to call  
You couldn't hold my heart with love, now you can't hold me at all  
CHORUS  
Caught in the act, caught in the act  
Caught in the act, C.I.T.A.  
Caught in the act, caught in the act  
Caught in the act, C.I.T.A.  


Yin yang  
A feeling's evolving through me  
Sweet and sour  
Is the taste you bring  
  
When I said goodbye, you loved me  
When I turned to you, you turned away  
When I was so gung-ho  
He said "let me go"  
  
He begged me to stay, stay, stay  
If I try to find out what's on your mind  
I'll find out in Chinatown  
  
[Chorus]  
Chinatown  
I don't know how to read you  
Upside down  
The signs will all mislead you  
Like this town  
you're such a mystery to me  
Chinatown  
I don't know how to read you  
Upside down  
The signs will all mislead you  
  
I'll track you down  
And you'll go crazy for me  
So much smoke I can't get through to you  
Eyes that I can't see  
  
They stare me down  
Here I'm chasin' you  
Some crazy Fu Manchu  
And it feels so wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong  
  
When I try to find out what's on your mind  
I'll find out in Chinatown  
  
[Chorus]


Oh, my love has no beginning  
And my love it has no end  
Always plus and always minus  
It never breaks, it never bends  
You can shape it any way you want  
You can turn it left or right  
Cause my love it comes in circles  
And it comes in black and white  
  
And the circle remains unbroken  
And the circle remains unbroken  
  
Bridge:  
Hope my love don't fade away  
(in my soul)  
Hope my love don't fade away  
(I don't want it to)  
Hope my love don't fade away  
(In my soul)  
Hope my love don't fade away  
  
Chorus:  
Circles have ups and downs  
Don't let them turn you 'round  
Round and round  
Round and round  
Circles, circles  
Don't let them bring you down  
Round and round  
Round and round  
  
There is ice, there's fire  
Always winter, always spring  
Cause my love is like a zero  
It is nothing and everything  
Oh, you know it's like the universe  
No matter how big or small  
It goes on and on forever  
It never drops, it never falls  
  
And forever remains unbroken  
And forever remains unbroken  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
(2X)


Coltrane (repeat)  
Round and round we'll chase  
Like a silver train  
Focused in a storm  
Comin' through the rain  
Avalanche of notes  
Ships of crystal clear  
On this earth they fall  
But nobody seems to hear  
Coltrane (repeat)  
Round and round we'll chase  
Like a silver train  
Focused in a storm  
Comin' through the rain  
Avalanche of notes  
Ships of crystal clear  
On this earth they fall  
But nobody seems to hear  
When I dream I fly  
Through this stormy world  
Ships of sound I ride  
Far from pain and fear  
To Coltrane's sound so clear  
Coltrane  
  


I've got this feelin' inside  
And it won't go away  
It'll take time for it to subside  
And oh by the way  
Come 2 my house  
Where we can play  
Like I'm your flower  
We'll hide and seek  
Then we will find  
Love's highest power  
Could you stop by for some really good beer  
Or a glass of wine  
There's no threat, there's no danger here  
If you fore go, go the time  
A look in your eyes  
And you remind  
Me of my daddy  
I can't say why  
I decided tonight  
Yes, you can have me  
Love will surrender  
Oh, when the heart cries out  
Don't leave me standin' here  
Not here, not now  


Sun...  
How can I thank you  
You've warmed my heart and soul  
You've made my body brown and smooth  
Washed away the cold  
Moon...  
You've made a dreamer out of me  
I can see, and I think I can feel it when you  
Change your face  
Please forgive me if I turn away  
I'm just a sleeper  
I know that you watch my dreams  
You're my heavenly keeper  
  
Heavenly keeper  
Heavenly keeper  
Just a sleeper  
Heavenly keeper, oh -  
  
Stars...  
What a mystical woman that you made me  
I've seen of times before the human race  
As long as I'm breathing  
As long as I can move  
I'll be strong  
Cause I know you've always been in the place  
Please forgive me if I turn away  
I'm just a sleeper  
I know that you watch my dreams  
You're my heavenly keeper  
  
Heavenly keeper  
Heavenly keeper  
Just a sleeper  
Heavenly keeper  
  
Never, never, never, never  
(repeat)


Come along let's park (let's park)  
Can't you see what's going on  
Come along gotta get with it  
You're space bound and going strong  
And he said  
Come along lets rock  
Shake your body don't stop  
Cause I'm never out of fuel  
You're good at talkin'  
But at listenin' you ain't so cool  
So you better get with it baby  
Chorus  
Earth to Mickey  
When are you gonna land?  
Earth to Mickey  
When are you gonna land?  
(Why can't you just come on down,  
Down to my level here)  
Tonight I'm watchin' you  
And you wouldn't understand  
How could you ever get so spaced out  
And never ever land  
I just wanna tell you  
You're outta your mind  
It'll take a little time  
But I bet I can talk you down  
There are unnurtured treasure  
Right here on solid ground  
So you better get with it baby  
Repeat chorus  
(Hear me talkin' to ya mickey)  
Mickey's rap:  
Excuse me but it's hard to hear  
Cause I'm way up in the stratosphere  
I caught your drift  
But I still don't see  
I changed my long distance company recently  
I'm not a guy that's kinda shy  
I gotta get home before my goldfish die  
My friends say I caught your eye  
They say you like the way I tie my tie  
I don't know why you wanna stare  
Don't touch...i just combed my hair  
(push)  
Please talk me down  
Where's the ground?  
Hold on you better slow down  
You might be 'fore your time  
I think you got kicked out  
From the white school of bump and grind  
Mickey come along let's walk  
Can we have a little talk?  
You've been busted in mid-flight  
Whenever you're puzzled you just  
Put on your big red light  
Chaka's rap:  
You know I know what they mean now  
When they say that you're all dressed up  
And nowhere to go  
Mickey really I been tryin to talk to you  
All night I've been lookin at you  
And lookin at you  
And tryin to talk and talk  
But you just don't listen  
You're on some eternal flight  
I just can't seem to make you make sense  
Mickey, Mickey  
Repeat chorus  
Ad lib to fade  


[Chorus:]  
I'll take every little thing I do  
And give it up, give it all up for you  
I mean every little thing, it's true  
Give it up, give it all up for you  
  
Busy, I'm so busy  
Climbing higher, moving further every day  
Gotta keep going, don't you know it  
Can't let sentimental feelings in the way  
  
But there comes a time  
When you want to share your heart  
Give up everything  
And just lose yourself in love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Keep up with the Jones'  
If they got it then you need it right away  
The grass ain't greener, you'll discover  
When you're lonely it don't get better anywhere  
  
'Cause there comes a time in my life  
When I want to share my heart  
Give up everything  
And just lose myself in love  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Giving you everything  
About to give up everything  
Giving you everything  
  
Good timing is everything  
And right now I'm here for you  
I'll turn the lights down baby  
And lock the door for you


Yeah, uh hmm  
Yeah, uh hmm  
Yeah, uh hmm  
  
Strange vibrations in the air  
Is anybody really aware that  
Everybody's got an aura  
It can either work against ya or it can work for ya  
  
What is this madness goin' down?  
While we're walkin' on a solid ground  
Cause even the mighty stand accused  
I think we've all been used  
  
We've got to get ourselves together, yeah  
If we want the situation to get better (get better)  
Yeah, said yeah, yeah  
  
Politicians tryin' to draw the right conclusions  
Think about it  
Is that the right solution?  
  
Cause everybody's got an aura  
It can either work against ya or it can work for ya  
  
We've got to get ourselves together  
If we want the situation to get better (get better)  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Uh hmm  
Uh hmm  
Uh hmm  
  
Strange vibrations in the air  
Is anybody really ware that  
Everybody's got an aura  
If you're not careful, it can harm ya  
  
Everybody's got an aura  
  
(repeat to fade)


Everybody wants you, you got it goin' on  
And you know it's not fair  
All the ladies want to profess their love to you  
And yet you really don't care  
You might think you have everything  
Whether you do or not, I think that you forgot that  
Everything changes, left to right, cold gets hot  
Everything changes, one day will turn to night  
Whether you like it or not  
Now, I am no authority  
But I've been around and I've seen a lot  
Love's the one priority  
Either settle down or lose the little you've got  
We don't have forever  
It's now or never so shoot your best shot  
Everything changes, left to right, cold gets hot  
Everything changes, one day will turn to night  
Whether you like it or not  
It's no good to keep on holdin' back  
All those good emotions, I'll be there for you  
You might think you have everything  
Whether you know or not, I think that you forgot that  


Can you hear me calling  
Out your name  
You know I'm falling  
And I don't know what to say  
  
I'll speak a little louder  
I'll even shout  
You know that I'm proud  
And I can't get the words out  
  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Wanna be with you everywhere  
  
Something's happening  
Happening to me  
My friends all say  
I'm acting peculiarly  
  
C'mon baby  
We better make a start  
You better do it soon  
Before you break my heart  
  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Wanna be with you everywhere  
  
Can you hear me calling  
Out your name  
You know I'm falling  
And I don't know what to say  
  
Come along baby  
We better make a start  
You better do it soon  
Before you break my heart  
  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Wanna be with you everywhere


I'm in the mood to end these empty days  
Ever when I, you stare down, romancin'  
Everytime I see your face, hopeless - colder than ice  
With no more flame  
I think our love has reached the part of no return  
It?s so sad when lovers don't see  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away  
  
That distant look is all you've got to say  
Everytime I try to talk to you  
Every word is lost in space  
Drifting further apart in every way  
We've come to be the ones that love is out of sight  
It's so clear that we just don't see  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away  
  
There's no reason for this heartache  
To go on and on, when the feeling?s gone  
I can say now, that it's to late  
To try and change your mind  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away


Back when we first met  
I think it was November  
I remember thinking that  
You had the sweetest smile  
Magic  
You have it  
Command me I'll obey  
It's just a fact of love  
Mold me  
Control me  
I'm only made of clay  
It's a fact of love  
CHORUS:  
Sometimes I wonder what is this love  
At once so delightful and frightening  
Thunder and lightening (love)  
The facts of love  
With those moody broody eyes  
You could be Svengali  
Just one touch - I'm mesmerized  
I just can't help myself  
You want it  
You got it  
You only have to say  
It's a fact of love  
You make me feel like I'm only made of clay  
A fact of love  
CHORUS  
Sometimes I wonder  
About the facts of love  
I sit and wonder  
About the facts of love  


When you walked into my lonely life tonight  
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight  
And the moment I held you I knew it  
What we do is decided before we do it  
  
[Chorus]  
Fate, this could only be  
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in  
Fate, now I understand  
It's part of the plan  
I was meant to be your woman  
  
Time stood still, and we lost on words to say  
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away  
Oh we knew it was love we were feeling  
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In my heart I feel I've loved you all my life  
I was in the dark, but now I think I've seen the light  
I rang like a bell with your laughter  
Something tells me I'll love you forever and ever  
  
Fate (this could only be)  
It was fate (this could only be)  
It's part of the plan  
I was meant to be your woman  
(It's part of the plan)  
I'll love you forever and ever


Father's waiting 'round the corner  
Ticket in his hand  
Wants to help his daughter  
Protect and understand  
Daughter's needing some security  
The comfort of a man  
Can't face the pain of losing  
She's afraid to love again  
Searching for her father's words  
She remembered  
  
[Chorus]  
My father he said, "don't be misled."  
My father he said, "is heart in your hands?"  
  
(Way far, far away)  
Daughter's feelin' kinda shaky  
Heartache and trouble everywhere  
There ain't no love she's looking  
For someone who cares  
Searching for her father's words  
She remembered  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Take the train far, cooling down)  
Daughter's waiting at the station  
Got a ticket in her hand  
Bound for her destination  
She'll try to love again  
Searching for her father's words  
She remembered  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Father, father, father  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Father, father, father he said


Don't it feel good to feel  
Don't it feel good  
Now that you know what's real  
Don't it feel good  
You see the love in your brother's eyes  
You've never seen before  
And you're not afraid to cry  
Don't it feel good  
  
Don't it feel good to be  
Don't it feel good  
Now that we all agree  
Don't it feel good  
Learning to know is what helps us show  
We've always been the same  
And when the walls come tumbling down  
Don't it feel good  
  
Don't hide it, it's there within you  
You've found it, if you've ever been you  
So take it with you  
  
Don't it feel good to see  
Don't it feel good  
Now that you know you're me  
Don't it feel good  
You realize that your time is now  
It's always been your own  
And you've got nowhere to go  
Don't it feel good  
  
Get it, get it, get it on  
Get it, get it, get it on


Fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
People living in the world for material things  
Love has a playful heart  
That's where the hatred starts  
Causin' harm and replacin' the joy true love can bring  
  
Chorus:  
It's just a fool's paradise  
It's just a fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
  
Whoa -  
  
(And you don't know)  
Just like a concrete dream  
Fool's paradise is strange  
People buying time don't seem like a natural thing  
Souls are lost to sea  
Souls that will never be  
Returning to this place of living misery  
  
It's a fool's paradise  
It's just a fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Fool's paradise  
  
(ooh it's just a)  
  
Fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
Whoa -  
  
Souls are lost to sea  
Souls that'll never be  
Returning to this place of living misery  
  
Fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
(repeat to fade)


Night's gonna fall  
Letting the stars shine through and through  
Time on the wall  
Bringing me closer to the  
One i want  
I can't wait no more, no, no  
  
Lost like a child  
Even my knees are shaking  
Caught for a while  
Under a wave that's breaking  
Over me  
In his arms i float  
  
When he looks at me this way  
I know what he'll say  
  
Chorus:  
Get ready, get set  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
All day, all night  
Here's something you can't forget  
Get ready, get set  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
All day, all night  
Here's something you can't forget  
  
I could try  
Imagining something better than  
You and i  
Making sweet love together  
Taking me much farther than before  
When he looks at me this way  
I know just what he'll say  
  
Ooh ooh  
When he looks at me this way  
I know just what he'll say  
  
Na na na na  
Na na na na


I wanna get deeper  
Deeper than skin  
I wanna be more than  
just another friend  
  
I'm ready to love you  
with all of my heart  
But I won't give it if you  
can't do your part  
  
[Chorus]  
A little bit just ain't it  
Give me all  
A little love is not enough  
Give me all  
  
Need your lovin'  
Need your kissin'  
Don't want nothin'  
To be missin'  
  
You're givin' me portions  
You wanna move fast  
What you're giving  
Is never gonna last  
  
I wanna be closer  
I need to have more  
'Cause I'm gonna love you  
like no one before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Need your lovin'  
Need your kissin'  
Don't want nothin'  
To be missin'  
  
I'm on fire babe  
You wanna build me up  
Just to let me down


Goldfinger, he's the man, the man with the Midas touch  
A spider's touch  
Such a cold finger beckons you to enter his web of sin  
But don't go in  
  
Golden words he will pour in your ear  
But his lies can't disguise what you fear  
For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her  
It's the kiss of death from Mister  
  
Goldfinger, pretty girl, beware of this heart of gold  
This heart is cold  
  
Golden words he will pour in your ear  
But his lies can't disguise what you fear  
For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her  
It's the kiss of death from Mister  
  
Goldfinger, pretty girl, beware of this heart of gold  
This heart is cold  
He loves only gold  
Only gold  
He loves gold  
He loves only gold  
Only gold  
He loves gold!


Got to be there, got to be there in the morning  
When she says hello to the world.  
Got to be there, got to be there,  
Bring her good times and show her that she's my girl.  
Oh, what a feeling there'll be the moment I know she loves me.  
Cause when I look in her eyes.  
I realize I need her sharing the world beside me.  
So I've got to be there, got to be there in the morning,  
And welcome her into my world, and show her that she's my girl.  
When she says hello world!  
Got to be there.  
  
Got to be there, got to be there  
When she needs someone to keep her through the night.  
Got to be there, got to be there, to take her hand and lead her into my life.  
Oh, what a feeling there'll be the moment I know she loves me  
Cause when I look in her eyes,  
I realize I need her sharing the world beside me.  
That's why I've got to be there,  
Got to be there where love begins and that's ev'rywhere she goes,  
I've got to be there so she knows that when she's with me she's home.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.

Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.


People ask me everywhere  
"Is that really all your hair?"  
I just tell 'em, "If it ain't  
Then it sure don't mean  
That now I can't"  
I just don't believe it's fair  
To judge a girl by the length of her hair  
Take two words like "hip" and "square"  
The truth will shine and not your hair  
Even the blind can almost see  
What's outside you and inside me  
Down or high, truth or lie  
A weak girl's laugh can be  
A strong girl's cry  
Black or blond or nappy or fair -  
You can't judge nobody by hair  
If I thought that you would care  
I'd wear a wig up under my hair  
Down or high, truth or lie  
A weak girl's laugh can be  
A strong girl's cry  


Half Moon, Nighttime sky  
Silver stone, Heaven's eye  
Silver stone from the seven seas  
Won't you be sure you bring sweet love home to me  
  
You thrill me like a mountain  
You thrill me like a sea  
Nighttime's past but still at last your love  
Half moon, Nighttime stone  
  
You be sure that you call my name  
Telling everybody going around  
Won't you tell the world about sweet, sweet love I found you  
  
Thrill me like a mountain  
Thrill me like sea a sea, lord!  
Nighttime's past, still at last love!  
Half moon, Nighttime sky  
  
Silver stone from the seven seas  
Won't you be sure you bring your sweet love home to me now!


Steamin' down the muddy waters  
Travelin' yonder from bay to bay  
I been workin' on the barge line  
Fourteen years ago today  
Eighteen hours hard labor by the day  
Ain't much pay for a man  
  
Chorus:  
Haulin' coal down the down river  
And he won't be comin' home for a long time  
  
Torches burning by the riverside  
Cast their shadows grey as stone  
And the cool October days replacing  
Much warmer thoughts of home  
I can still see grandma sittin' on the porch  
Tellin' the neighbors she's got a grandson  
  
Chorus:  
Haulin' coal down the down river  
And he won't be comin' home for a long time  
  
River's rising up the marker line  
While the willows softly moan  
Sun is rising over the starboard shore  
Paving the golden road back home  
  
I can still see the kids jumpin' rope  
But there ain't much hope for a man  
  
Chorus:  
Haulin' coal down the down river  
And he won't be comin' home for a long time  
  
Haulin' coal down the down river  
I'll be gone a long time  
  
Haulin' coal down the down river  
I'll be gone a long while


Chorus:  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
  
Who said this party's over?  
When I feel like my fun has just begun  
Together we will raise this roof and party  
And have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, oh yeah  
All we need is some funky music  
So we can play the part and get way down  
Into some rhythm we can groove to  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Who said this party's over?  
I feel like my fun has just begun  
Together we will raise this roof and party  
And have a good time  
Have a good time, yeah  
All we need is some funky music, yeah  
So we can play the part and get way down  
Into some rhythm we can groove to  
Everybody have a good time  
  
(repeat to fade)


When the road gets dark  
And you can no longer see  
Let my love throw a spark  
And have a little faith in me.  
  
When the tears you cry  
Are all you can believe.  
Give these loving arms a try  
And have a little faith in me.  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Faith in me  
  
When your secret heart  
Can not speak so easily  
Let a whisper become a start  
And have a little faith in me  
  
And when your back's against the wall  
Just turn around you will see  
I will catch you, I will catch your fall, baby  
Just have some faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Faith in me  
  
I've been loving you such a long time boy  
Expected nothing in return.  
Just for you to have a little faith faith in me  
Time is our friend.  
  
And all you gotta do is have a little faith in me.  
I said,  
I will hold you up, I will hold you up.  
Your love gives me stength enough.  
  
Have a little faith in me, oh  
Have a little faith in me.


Darlin' there's a thing or two  
I want to take the time to say  
Every moment here with you  
Puts heaven in my day  
  
I'm mystified by the smile that blossoms on your face  
And the magic seems to lift me to a cloud where we embrace  
I don't have to dream no more, no  
Now I believe in miracles  
Your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
  
Oh, I simply must confess  
I'm glad to be a girl  
You've got to be an angel  
Cause you put heaven in my world  
  
Your shadow is my tropic sun  
And it's summer all year long  
Your presence is my paradise  
How could anything go wrong  
  
Now I'm absolutely sure  
That you're all I've been living for, yeah  
Your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
Heaven  
  
I'm in, I'm in heaven  
I'm in, I'm in heaven  
I'm in, I'm in heaven  
  
Every time I'm near you my heart just won't keep still  
The closer that I get to you, the better that I feel  
I don't have to dream no more, no, no  
  
Now you're all I'm living for, yeah  
Cause your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
  
(repeat)


There are so many things in life to know  
Cause someone says it's right don't make it so  
This is someone somewhere who's taking notes  
There's someone telling lies sowing wild oats  
When you are moving fast, you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here's a warning: two wrongs don't make a right  
Heed the warning, and everything will be alright  
I'll keep good meter, and I'll take my time  
I'll try to stay in beat and live in rhyme  
I know from love I came, to love I'll go  
I'll live and learn and love and try to grow  
When you are moving fast, you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed


Baby when you need me  
Wintertime or anytime at all  
I'll be right there for you  
Be right there whenever you call  
  
And I say baby I'm addicted  
I'm addicted to your love  
I love you more and more  
More and more than all the stars above  
  
And I say boy I love the way you walk  
And I say boy even when you talk  
You rock my world  
Feel so good to me  
Don't you know that you're my fantasy  
  
Want, I want your lovin'  
Need, I need ya  
Want, I want your lovin'  
Need, I need ya  
Can't ya see  
Your love is good for me  
  
Baby when you need me  
Wintertime or anytime at all  
I'll be right there for you  
Be right there whenever you call  
  
And I say baby you can do it  
You know how to love me, love me right  
You know just what to do  
Know just how to fill my appetite


I see that guy that you're standing near  
I know yu think that he's fine  
He gets you hot with his dancing gear  
But you ain't had none of mine  
  
Oh I like the way you move  
I'd like to feel your groove  
He'll never do you like me  
I got the stuff you need  
  
Oh, danse pour ton amour  
I'm dancing for your love  
Je danse pour ton amour  
Dancing for your love tonight  
  
I saw you looking like you wanted some  
And you were looking at me  
If you want to party and have some fun  
(Then) I'm the guy you should see  
  
I, I got the stuff to soothe  
I like the way you move  
You got the power to be  
Everything that I need


Whatever you want,  
Whatever you need,  
Anything you want done, baby,  
I'll do it naturally  
Cause I'm every woman  
It's all in me.  
It's all in me, yeah!  
  
I'm every woman,  
It's all in me.  
Anything you want done, baby,  
I'll do it naturally.  
  
I'm every woman,  
It's all in me.  
I can read your thoughts right now,  
Every one from A to Z.  
  
I can cast a spell,  
Of secrets you can tell,  
Mix a special brew,  
Put fire inside of you.  
Anytime you feel danger or fear,  
Then instantly  
I will appear 'cause...  
  
I'm every woman,  
It's all in me.  
Anything you want done, baby,  
I'll do it naturally.  
  
I can sense your needs  
Like rain unto the seeds.  
I can make a rhyme  
Of confusion in your mind.  
And when it comes back to some good old-fashioned love,  
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, got it, baby, 'cause...  
  
I'm every woman,  
It's all in me.  
Anything you want done, baby,  
I'll do it naturally.  
  
I'm every woman,  
It's all in me.  
I can read your thoughts right now,  
Every one from A to Z.  
  
I ain't braggin' 'cause I am the one  
You just ask me, oo, it shall be done.  
And don't bother to compare,  
I've got it.  
  
I'm every woman...


We go on and on  
From dawn to dawn  
The years have flown  
Much faster than we know  
And still in love we grow  
  
Time has placed us here  
Afraid of fear  
We've seen through tears  
That never should have come  
And still in love we grow  
  
Like a baby dove  
Our love in time it's snowy wings unfold  
To soar above  
I'll stay another hour, another day  
My whole life  
As long as I feel this way  
I'll stay with you and know  
As long as I feel this way  
In we'll grow


It's you, no one else will do  
I knew one day  
Another true love would come my way  
Only time will tell  
If it's right, it just can't fail  
And there you were  
And my quest for love is over  
Now my only lover...is you  
  
No one else will do  
It's true  
I'm the only one for you  
  
Love ain't so bad  
If you have an understanding  
You know it's everlasting  
You let it show with the test of time  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
Without a doubt  
Now my quest for love is over  
Now my only lover  
  
It's you....i'll never love another  
Nobody can take your place  
Without a doubt  
My quest for love is over  
My only lover  
It's you

Your love is like a maze  
I can't get through to you  
You keep me in a daze  
What's a girl to do with you?  
  
Loving you is like a puzzle  
Just when I think that this is it  
You shake me up  
The pieces just don't fit  
It's like a ...

If you would only trace the dotted line

Oh, you're no good  
Jive talkin'  
So misunderstood  
  
Jive talkin'  
You'll never know how  
Jive talkin'  
You'll never know now  
  
Ooh baby, you just don't know  
What you've done to me  
You've tried, you'll never know  
Tryin' to take away my energy  
  
With all your jive talkin'  
You're tellin' a lie  
Jive talkin'  
You wear a disguise

I know you've been hurt before  
I can see it in your eyes  
And if you just shut the door  
I would not be surprised  
Even though I know you've heard it  
These words I'm tryin' to say  
I think the others only flirted  
With the true meaning of always  
Well, you can say what you wanna  
But I ain't gonna stop  
This journey 2 the center of your heart  
I see the candle through your window  
It burns there every night  
The shadow leaves an innuendo  
Of no one holdin' you right  
Many nights I've dreamt you near me  
But awakened to you gone  
I know one day you'll hear me  
I don't care how long  
Well, you can say what you wanna  
But I ain't gonna stop  
This journey 2 the center of your heart  
I've waited a lifetime, baby  
Just to know your name  
We've done everything in our minds  
Let's stop the game, let's stop it  
Even though I know  
You've heard these words I'm tryin' to say  
Somehow I think these others  
They only flirted with the true meaning of always  


Keep givin' me lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'  
Time after time, I've pondered this love that I'm feeling  
I feel so divine  
It must be a crime  
Don't take it away  
  
[Bridge:]  
More than a few told me "I love you"  
Now I know better  
When it got down to you  
Somehow I knew  
My number was up for some sweet sweet lovin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
Keep givin' me lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'  
I'm talkin' 'bout lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'  
You've captured this girl, rockin' my world ya got me reelin'  
Ain't no future with another  
You're my one and only lover  
Come on and stay  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is it any wonder I want you so  
Only you can satisfy my need  
Can't you see my hunger won't let you go  
Babe you belong to me, just to me


How high the sky goes  
Nobody wants to know  
That's how your love seemed to grow  
Like the winter gives birth to spring  
You've become my everything  
And in my life it must show  
  
Chorus:  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Comin' comin' straight to me  
  
I find with no one else  
I could express myself  
You took the time and looked in my mind  
  
Like mysteries untold, I'm starting to unfold  
You reached the limits of my soul  
  
Chorus:  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Comin' comin' straight to me  
  
How high the sky goes  
Nobody wants to know  
That's how your love seemed to grow  
Just like the world keeps going round and round  
And we never fall off the ground  
Like gravity your love is pullin' me  
  
Chorus:  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Comin' comin' straight to me


When your heart is free  
It?s easy to make a decision  
When your head is clear  
You know you have good judgment  
But when your life is turning topsy turvey  
And you have no reasons for what?s disturbing  
Remember these words my father said to me  
(Chorus)  
He said: Keep your head up don?t say you love him  
(Keep your head)  
Walk away from all that has hurt you  
(Find your power)  
Find your power you know your strong  
Make that step and it will help you along  
  
When your mind's at peace  
(at peace)  
Sleep comes so very peacefully  
When you start to dream  
They are wonderful and so very sweet  
But when your life is turning topsy turvey  
And you have no answers for what?s disturbing  
Remember these words a preacher said to me  
(Chorus)  
He said: Keep your head up don?t say you love him  
(Keep your head up)  
Walk away from all that is hurting  
(Find your power)  
Find your power you know your strong  
(Take that step)  
Make that step and it will help you along (2x)  
  
Why give up this time you can win  
(You can win)  
Why give up this battle is within  
(Is within)  
Why stay when you don't know what he's gonna do  
Why choose him when its time to choose you  
  
Keep your head up don?t say you love him  
Walk away from all that is hurting  
Find your power you know your strong  
Make that step it will help you along (2x)  
Keep your head up (6x)  


[Chorus]  
Life is a dance, life is a dance  
Life is a dance, life is a dance  
  
Everywhere coast to coast  
Around the land  
We all have one thing in common  
We all love to dance  
In and out of discos, crazy lights  
Keep on movin' all through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why don't you listen  
Listen to the groove  
I am sure enough sure you'll find  
Just the rhythm, the rhythm of your soul  
Dance to the music keepin' steady time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dance to the music, crazy lights  
Dance to the music on crazy lights  
Dance to the music, crazy lights  
Dance


Time comes down  
You got to take it on yourself  
You got to give up your past  
You got to give up what came last  
World goes round  
You got to leave it all behind  
You got defeated at last  
  
Little boy blue  
With the feelin' in your soul and the gypsy in your eyes  
Little boy blue  
You got to leave this song behind as it passes by  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Life goes on  
You got to catch it if you can  
You must believe it will last  
You can't remember what went past  
Tide comes in  
This fog will surely roll away  
It can't leave, it will stay  
  
Little boy blue  
Tootin' on your coke and takin' a toke  
In a lazy haze  
Little boy blue  
Got to leave this song behind as it passes by  
  
Tide comes in  
This boat will surely row away  
It can't leave if we stay  
  
Little boy blue  
Tootin' on your coke and takin' a toke  
In a lazy haze  
Little boy blue  
Got to leave this song behind as it passes by


Why is it I'm always chasin' after you  
Why can't it just be you that chases me  
Look through my eyes  
Can you see me  
Searchin' with nothin' in sight  
Touch with my hands can't you feel me  
Reachin' for you in the night  
  
I been trying hard to keep you satisfied  
Can't say I haven't tried ? Bet your life  
Change all my bitter to sweet love  
Change all my darkness to light  
Surrender the love you're concealing  
My love will make it alright  
  
Look through my eyes  
Can't you see me  
Touch with my hands  
Can't you feel me  
Change all my bitter to sweet love  
Make it right  
  
Baby I'm in love and I just can't stay  
Besides my love won't compromise or be denied  
  
Repeat  
  
Look through my eyes  
Can you see me  
Searchin' with nothin' in sight  
Touch with my hands can't you feel me  
Reachin' for you in the night  
Change all my bitter to sweet love  
Change all my darkness to light  
Surrender the love you're concealing  
My love will make it alright


Losers - losers - losers - losers  
  
The moment I saw your face  
Your eyes swept me away  
The moment I heard your voice  
I knew we'd touch someday  
But we're losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please don't turn away  
Just because I'm beeing real  
'Cause I've been through this before  
And I don't want to be a loser in love  
  
Loser - loser  
I don't want to be  
Loser - loser  
  
I know it's not my time so I'll be on my way  
I'll never forget your smile  
And I won't forget this day  
'Cause we're losers in love  
In a time of empty dreams  
Just two losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please don't turn me away  
'Cause I don't want to be losers in love


Love is a burning inside  
I never had this feeling before, no  
All I know is that it won't let me be myself  
Hey, is this really love  
Oh maybe that's the reason  
I feel so good when you're around  
(Feel so good when you're around)  
Why can't I remember  
The day I melted before your charms  
Oh was it way back in September  
When you held me in your arms  
Now that I see that you're the one for me  
It's no more a mystery  
Love has fallen down on me  
Ooh I'm in love with you  
Love has fallen on me  
Now I really see  
Love has fallen on me  
Oh what tender love you bring  
No, it's not a game  
Oh what tender love you bring  
No, it's not a game  
Hey what tender love you bring  
I fell in love with you  
Fell in love with you  
One day in September love came falling down on me  
One day in September love came tumbling down on me  
Ooh what tender love you bring  
Oh now Lord I can't, no no,  
And I can't believe my eyes  
No no one day in September,  
It came on down  
Oh fallin' down, love came falling all around  
I fell in love with you  
Fell in love with you  


Ooh, Lullaby of Birdland  
That is what I always hear, when you sigh  
Never in my Wordland  
Could there be ways to reveal in a phrase how I feel?  
  
Have you ever heard two turtledoves  
Bill and Coo, when they're in love?  
That's the kind of magic music  
We'll make with our lips when we kiss  
  
And there's that weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry  
That's how I'd cry on my pillow  
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye  
  
Lullaby of Birdland, whisper low  
Kiss me sweet and we'll go  
Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above  
All because we're in love  
  
Have you ever heard two turtledoves  
Bill and Coo, when they're in love?  
That's the kind of magic music  
We'll make with our lips when we kiss  
  
And there's that weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry  
That's how I'd cry on my pillow  
If you should tell me farewell or goodbye  
  
Lullaby of Birdland, whisper low  
Kiss me sweet and then we'll go  
Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above  
All because, baby, we're in love  
  
Lullaby of Birdland  
Ooh, Lullaby of Birdland, yeah  
Lullaby of Birdland  
Lullaby


I'm feeling down, in some kinda lonely  
Cuz my baby done left me here  
Hearts blazing like a five alarm fire  
And I don't even give a care  
I feel like the world is fallin'  
Dreams to ashes right in front of my face  
I'm gettin' kind of worried and I feel so out of place  
  
Chorus:  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
  
In the morning when I get a heartache  
I can't call on the doctor for help  
Cuz the only person that could ever do me any good is runnin'  
Around with my best friend  
Oh, I feel like I'm slippin' deeper, lower, a little deeper into myself  
I tell you that I just can't handle it, you all  
It's scaring me to death  
  
Chorus:  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
  
Repeat chorus


I'm in such a mood  
Turned on by the thought of you  
You're not around  
So I just sit here and brood  
Amongst a lethal combination  
Kind of midnight mood sedation  
I miss you  
But that's another kind of silence  
Sittin' by the fire  
Stare into the flames  
Without you I'm as lonely as the night train  
  
Chorus  
And Miles is blowin cool through the room  
I wish that I could be there with you  
Was it the strike of two  
Or the sound of his blues  
You're going to my head  
And Miles is blowin' through the room  
  
Gypsy music for lonely hearts  
Takes care of me while we're apart  
If you were here  
I'd be dancing with you  
How long must you keep me waiting  
Can't you see the toll it's taking  
I need you  
But that's another kind of maddness  
Now I'm almost through  
A solo bottle of champagne  
And I'm half way through  
Sketches of Spain  
  
Chorus  
And Miles is blowin cool through the room  
I wish that I could be there with you  
Was it the strike of two  
Or the sound of his blues  
You're going to my head  
And Miles is blowin' through the room


Just as sure as I live  
I will love you alone  
You belong in my arms  
You belong in my home  
I don't expect you to be  
Someone else that you're not  
All I expect you to give  
Is all that you've got, so  
CHORUS:  
Move me no mountain  
Turn me no tide  
Swim me no ocean  
Long, deep and wide  
Just say you love me, baby  
Long, strong and true  
But move me no mountain  
To prove that you do  
But move me no mountain  
To prove that you do  
Fill my life with your love  
You're my bread, you're my wine  
Fill my life with your love  
And I'll fill yours with mine  
You'll never hear me cry  
Tears of regret  
It's fine with me if all I see  
Is all I get  
Oh  
Just say you love me, baby  
Just love me, baby  
Long, strong and true  
Move me no mountain  
Turn me no tide  
Swim me no ocean  
Long, deep and wide  
Just love me, baby  
Long, strong and true  
Move me no mountain  
Turn me no tide  
Swim me no ocean  
Long, deep and wide  
Just love me, baby  
Say that you do  
Just love me, baby...  


I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
(I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
(I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
(I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
There's a story goin' all around  
Talking about it everywhere  
There's this gossip and this constant sound  
Livin' in the life just ain't fair  
They try to work me but it's all in vain  
They'll get this baby down  
They say I'm crazy, but that might well be,  
But there'll be no kickin' Chaka around... cause  
Chorus:  
I'm the ruler of my destiny  
If I fall then it's because of me (If I blow it it's because of me)  
There is nobody who's got the power  
To determine what becomes of me  
I'm aware of what we're here to do  
And, do is our only choice  
And if you like it'll be me and you,  
Singing with this one strong voice:  
  
This is bigger than the both of us  
I'm not afraid to walk that line  
Just be natural and we can try  
Every little thing's gonna turn out fine... cause  
Repeat chorus  
Vamp to end  


My funny valentine  
Sweet, comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Oooh, mmm  
Your looks are laughable  
Un-photographable  
Yet, you're my favorite work of art  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little bit weak?  
When you open it to speak, are you smart?  
Don't, baby don't, don't you change your hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, stay little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's...  
Each day is Valentine's Day  
Stay, little valentine, stay  
Stay, stay, yeah yeah  
Each day is Valentine's...  
Each day is Valentine's Day


Well I think it's time to get ready  
To realize just what I found  
I have lived unaware of what I am  
It's all clear to me now, that  
  
My heart is on fire  
My soul's like a wheel that's turning  
My love is alive, my love is alive  
  
Well there's something inside  
That's makin' me crazy  
Tryin' to keep it together  
Cause what I'm saying, I have been saving  
And now could be forever  
  
My love is alive, my heart's on fire  
Soul is like a wheel, like a hot wire  
My love is alive, my heart's on fire  
Soul's like a wheel, like a hot wire  
  
There's a mirror inside my mind  
Reflectin' the light that shines on me  
Hold on to the feeling  
Let it be, let it grow  
My heart is on fire, my love is alive  
  
Fire in my heart, soul's like a wheel that's turning  
My love is alive


All is fair in love boy  
When the love is shared  
Now you've been acting for some time  
Like you just don't care  
About me  
  
Well my mama used to say  
That there would come a day  
When fools begin to open up their eyes...  
  
Chorus:  
You never miss the water  
Till the well runs dry  
Now I have had enough bad love  
So I'm telling you goodbye, goodbye  
  
You've been taking me for granted  
You even made me cry  
And sorry just ain't good enough  
Baby not this time  
  
My mama used to say  
That there would come a day  
When the truth can no longer be denied...  
  
You're gonna miss my love  
You're gonna miss my love  
You're gonna miss my love  
  
You never miss the water  
Till the well runs dry for ya  
  
My mama used to say  
That there would come a day  
When you would run but baby you can't hide...


CHORUS:  
Night moods, I love your night moods  
Night moods, You've got the right moods  
When you're lying here beside me  
Ooh you take my breath away  
Baby I feel such love inside me  
I'm so glad you're going to stay  
Night moods, night moods  
Got a need as deep as a canyon  
I'm so glad I found my soul companion  
I love your night moods  
I'm in the right mood  
I love your night moods  
Night time is the right time  
Night time is the one time I'm loving you  
Loving you  
All day long I'm thinking of  
And I just can't wait 'til the sun goes down  
I can't help it, how I love it  
Count the moments 'til you come 'round  
Night moods, night moods  
Ain't no use in talkin' about it  
All I know is that I can't live without it  
I love your night moods  
I'm in the right mood  
I love your night moods  
Night time is the right time  
Right now is the one time I'm close to you  
Close to you  
Got a need as deep as a canyon  
I'm so glad I found my soul companion  
Night moods, I love your night moods  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  


I can still remember, the magic I saw in your eyes, so honest  
And so tender, true love with no compromise  
  
All those things I miss, when I reminisce, about you baby, um hm  
  
[Chorus]  
Why can't we go back in time, when I was your and you where mine,  
Love is special meant to be, eternally our love is one for all time  
(Um, time, mm) this time only  
  
How is it I see you, in every strangers face, I don't wanna need you,  
But my stubborn heart keeps going, and I just can't erase  
  
Oh oh oh oh all these things I miss when I remenise, about you boy,  
Bet you didn't know, how much I love ya, won't mean to show ya baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got to hear your conversation, intelligent debating, baby that  
Would move me, they way you, make me fell so special, how could  
You forget that, you where made for me, you where made for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Skatting, one for all time, mine,  
did you know there's a love, umm,  
our love, oh la la la la la,  
the greatest love, of all time,  
I love ya babe,  
the greatest love of all time, I love ya babe


If I could only shake the hand of time  
'Cause time has been good to us  
Bringin' us closer together  
I know our love is of a special kind  
A real everlasting love, that keeps getting better and better  
  
[Chorus]  
Night after night, night after night, day after day  
The closer we get - with every minute - just tickin' away  
Our love has come to see maturity  
And from the very day we said hello  
I washed out our love for all  
One million kisses later  
Our love is so much greater  
One million kisses after  
  
We share more love than laughter  
We've been through a lot together - you and I  
But time has been good to us  
Givin' us so much to treasure  
  
So many tomorrows we have left behind  
The future becomes harsh  
But this kind of love will last forever  
  
[Chorus]


I refuse to be amused  
That's sumthin' that ain't right  
I declare I'm well aware  
I felt the angel's vibes  
  
I can hear ya callin'  
No I'm not stallin'  
I'm justa doin' sumthin' else  
When I'm with you  
(I'm really with you)  
But right now I'm by myself  
And I...  
  
Chorus  
  
I can feel this fire  
Such a strange desire  
As strong as life itself  
I, I can feel this fire  
Such a strange desire  
And I don't want nothin' else  
But ooh I like your lovin'  
  
Talk so much I'm in a flux  
Ya just can't make up your mind  
Executin' dreams ain't easy  
Justa wastin' precious time  
Talk is cheap your words are weak  
I don't want you wastin' mine  
  
I hear ya callin'  
No I'm not stallin'  
I'm justa doin' sumthin' else  
When we're together  
(sho 'nuff together)  
Right now I'm by myself  
And I...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Ad lib to fade


Our love  
Our love's in danger  
If you don't hurry home  
I might  
Give it to a stranger  
I never wanted you to go  
I told you many times before  
I need your loving day to day  
I get so tired when you're far away  
You got me staring at the ceiling  
Better come quick  
You can't make it too soon  
I never want to do you wrong  
But you been gone away so long  
I don't know what you expect of me  
That's what I'm trying so hard to be  
Don't force me into another's arms  
Our love  
Our love  
Our love  
Get the picture, I'm here all alone  
Ain't you worried  
About your happy home  
What I'm thinking  
Makes me feels ashamed  
Tell me who's to blame  
Tell me what to do about the  
Strangers coming from everywhere  
Strangers calling my name  
Just don't know what to do about it  
  


I can tell by the look that's in your eyes  
And I'm not surprised  
You got to move on like the sun got to rise  
I'm just holdin' you down  
  
Bridge:  
But the universe is calling you  
You are one of chosen fews  
You got to pay your dues  
  
Me and the baby gonna miss you  
I see your smile in her face  
I only wish we were with you now  
It's a lonely, lonely place  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus:  
Hey, pack'd my bags, put 'em at the door  
Hey, pack'd my bags, put 'em at the door  
Hey, pack'd my bags, put 'em at the door  
  
I know you'll make it  
You deserve it, you know you do  
The blues, you'll shake it  
I'll, I'll focus our view  
  
Oh, don't let them change you  
Come like thieves in the night  
Oh, don't' let them rearrage you, boy  
You've got to do what's right  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Once a month, each time you say  
Goin' away, oh  
I don't wanna see you go  
No no no no no no no no no no  
  
Oh you, you've got to make it  
You've got to make it, boy  
Go on now


Please pardon me, but I'm longing to speak  
I hope you don't mind my staring  
I don't mind, cause your face looks so kind  
Seldom you'll find someone so daring  
  
You remind me of a friend of mine  
Ooh, I've lost (the) time, yeah  
  
Everytime I see your face  
You remind me of that someone  
In fact, it's true, it's you  
Runnin' right into you  
  
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine  
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind  
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine  
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind  
  
Please pardon me, but I'm longing to speak  
I hope you don't mind my starin'  
I don't mind, cause your face looks so kind  
Seldom you'll find someone so daring  
  
Everytime I see your face  
You remind me of that someone  
In fact, it was you  
Runnin' right into you


There may be some youngbloods  
Waitin' in the wings  
I'm puttin' on my good duds  
So you can hear me sing  
I know what you're thinkin' but  
This ain't no one night stand  
I'm savin' all the good love  
For only one man  
Pop, pop my clutch (4x)  
Don't worry 'bout the weather  
In London or Rome  
Once we get together  
You're gonna take me home  
I've had plenty boyfriends  
Now I need a man  
To love me, whatever  
And a ring on my hand  
Listen pretty baby  
I won't say it twice  
You could save me  
From my own device  
Honesty is so refreshing  
I don't get that much  
You just might be the blessing  
To make me pop my clutch  
Chorus  
I know what you're thinkin'  
But this ain't no one night stand  
I'm savin' the good stuff  
For only one man  
Listen, pretty baby  
I won't say it twice  
You know you could save me  
I you pop it right  


I've seen you happy  
I've seen you low  
I've watched your prosper  
I've watched your grow  
But you're so unhappy  
And you should know  
That you need me now  
  
You've got your money  
You've got your pride  
You're so cute, you're so funny  
And you can't hide  
But there's something wrong here  
But I'm on your side  
And you need me now  
  
Chorus:  
You're aching  
There's no mistaking  
I've seen it before  
You're faking  
Your heart is breaking  
Get off the floor  
  
I hope there's something you let me do  
I live and love because of you  
And I set my sights with you in view  
So let's make a vow  
You live in a quandary  
You're blessed and cursed  
They say they love you  
But I saw you first  
And you think you could love me  
But you're unrehearsed  
So I'll show you how  
  
Chorus  
  
You hur inside  
You can't hide  
It's all up to you  
You hurt inside  
You lost all your pride  
It all comes down to you


Please forgive me, I don't know what to say  
Except I'm sorry to scare you away from me  
I get crazy and don't know what I've done  
It's all hazy thought we were having fun  
Was it so bad  
You feel you had to leave me, baby?  
Now that you're gone  
I need to belong, believe me, baby  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider  
Baby's cryin' it's so cold in our place inside I'm dyin'  
We need the smile on your face don't need no money  
I don't need no girlfriends, want my daddy  
To love me again and again and again and  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider  
Sometimes honey I know I talk too loud  
Short temper I'm apt to cuss you, you  
I don't mean it, passion gets the best of me  
Still I love you and I feel like you love me too  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider  
If you walk out that door  
You betta reconsider this if you don't call me no more  
You betta reconsider, reconsider that, reconsider  
If you think you were lonely before  
you betta, reconsider, reconsider this  
That I changed the lock on this door  
You betta reconsider that if you stop payin' these bills  
You gotta reconsider I betcha somebody will  
You betta reconsider  


[Chorus]  
Roll me through the rushes like Moses  
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses  
  
Roll me through the rushes like Moses  
Guide me to the new woman who waits  
Current, leave me on the banks  
By the cottage  
Where we will dine with silver cups  
And golden plates  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've prepared for my last journey  
You know I've worked all my life  
To make this basket strong  
But a woman alone on a river  
She can't stay in the water too long  
  
I've been chilled, I've lost my will  
And I've stayed away from rivers  
Much too long  
I really must stay in this dirty dirty city  
Till I found out that my strength was gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just like Moses  
  
Make my journey, make it short in space  
Let me lose this hardness that I got now, Lord  
Water, wash away all traces of hate  
I will do what you say  
If you just show me how, river  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Roll me through the rushes like Moses  
Roll me through the rushes  
Just like Moses on the Nile  
  
River, river (sail) [Repeat: x4]


Like a fool I went and stayed too long  
Now I'm wondering if you love's still strong  
Ooh baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
  
Here I am baby, you got the future in your hands  
Here I am baby, you got the future in your hands  
  
I've done a lot of foolish things  
That I really didn't mean  
  
Seen lot of things in this old world  
When I touched them they did nothing for this girl  
Ooh baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
  
Chorus:  
Here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
Here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
Here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
Here I am baby, you got the future in your hands  
  
I've done a lot of foolish things  
That I really didn't mean  
  
Oh baby, you set my soul on fire  
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire  
Here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours


[Chorus]  
(We've got to) Sleep on it  
Everything's gonna be alright  
If we just sleep on it  
Everything's gonna be alright  
  
Tonight there will be no more quarreling  
We'll shut out the lights, close our eyes  
I don't know how this started  
I don't know why we fight  
I'll apologize for all the unkind things  
I said to you  
Why can't I see what's right for me  
Might not be right for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People are gonna think  
What they what to think  
Feel what they want to feel  
I don't wanna see you cry  
I don't wanna see you compromise  
The things that shine  
The brightest in your eyes  
Hold on to your dreams  
Hold on to them tight


(CHORUS):  
Some love  
You know it brings me down down down  
Some love  
You know it brings me down down down  
They say that love is heaven sent  
Well I guess they told another lie  
How can it be a part of me  
You can't even look me in my eye  
(CHORUS)  
(BRIDGE):  
All this time you made a fool of me  
You told honey sweet lies  
I'm fed up with your alibis  
I was blind, now I see, yeah  
(CHORUS)  
Let's end this game, let's stop this farce  
'Cause I don't wanna live a lie  
Life's so short, and love's so sparse  
I guess I'll have to say goodbye  
It brings me down down down, yeah  
Some love, it brings me down down down  
(BRIDGE)  
If this is love, I want no part of it  
They call this love  
Now I've got to quit you, baby  
If this is love, I want no part of it  
They call this love, dirty dirty love  
Some love  
If this is love don't break my heart  
If this is love don't want no part  
If this is love don't break my heart  
If this is love don't want no part  
If this is love don't break my heart  
If this is love don't want no part  
If this is love don't break my heart  
Some love  
Oh first you burn me with desire  
Then you go and douse the fire  


I got me some cookin'  
Not all that good lookin'  
He's mighty sweet to me  
That's how he's keepin' me  
I ain't worried 'bout the future  
The here and now is lookin' cuter  
I like his recipe  
That's why I'm layin'  
You are just like my favorite spoon  
'Cause you stir me up  
I'm as full as a harvest moon  
Still I need more in my cup  
And only you can give it to me  
Am I happy?  
(I think so)  
Don't be so emotional  
(I can't help it, no)  
Will he be there?  
(I think so)  
It's one thing that I do know  
This I know  
Everybody needs to feel it  
Can't beg, borrow or steal it  
Love is all about lovin'  
When it's hot like an oven  
I ain't worried 'bout the future  
The here and now is lookin' cuter  
Got plenty o' time for sortin'  
'Cause Mama's little baby loves her shortnin' bread  
You are just like my favorite spoon  
'Cause you stir me up  
I'm as full as a harvest moon  
Still I need more in my cup  
And only you can give it to me  


Once I was a sentimental thing  
Throw my heart away each spring  
Now a spring romance  
Hasn't got a chance  
Promised my first dance to winter  
All I've got to show's a splinter  
For my little fling  
  
Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse  
That never left the post  
I lay in my room  
Starring up at the ceiling  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Morning kiss wakes trees and flower  
And to them my life  
To drink a toast I walk in the park  
Just to kill those lonely hours  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
All afternoon  
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune  
This is love this is it  
Heard it before  
And I know the score  
And I decide that love is a bore  
Love seem sure around the new year  
Now it's April  
  
Love is just a ghost  
Spring arrived on time  
But what became of you, dear  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Spring is here  
There's no mistaken  
Robins build their nest from coast to coast  
My heart tries the same  
So they won't hear it breaking  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
College boys are riding somewhere  
Tender passion there it grows  
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Love came my way  
I'm holding the last  
We had our day  
Now that's all in the past  
Spring came along  
A season of song  
For love's sweet promise  
But something went wrong  
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic  
Sulfur and molasses was the dose  
Didn't help me a bit  
My condition must be chronic  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
All alone, the party's over  
Winter was a gracious host  
But when you keep praying  
For snow to hide the clover  
Spring can really hang you up the most


Please stay with me now  
Don't you let me go  
I'll make it somehow  
I got to let you know  
That I'll make it  
Somehow, some way  
Though I wait on the day  
What I'm doing's gotta pay  
Some way, somehow  
  
My baby, when he cries  
It's 'cause something's on his mind  
This world is full of lies  
You and me are one of a kind  
The good lord will stand behind every step  
We are blind to fate, that's life, that's life  
  
Stay, stay, stay, stay (won't you please)  
Stay, stay, stay, stay  
  
It fits, but you can't make it work  
Where there's pain, there's got to be hurt  
And the green grass grows from the dirt  
Yeah, that's a fact of life alright  
The good lord stands behind every step  
We are blind to fate, that's life, that's life  
  
Stay, oh won't you please  
Stay, stay (won't you)  
Stay, stay, stay, stay  
Stay, stay, stay, stay  
  
Stay, stay (right here)  
Stay, stay (don't you go, no no)  
Stay, stay (oh no no)  
Stay, stay (stay baby baby please stay)  
Stay, stay (right here, right here, right here)  
Stay, stay (i want you to stay right here)  
Stay, stay (we can stay here, together, together yeah)  
Stay, stay (don't listen to what people say)  
Stay, stay (stay, stay, listen now yeah)  
Stay, stay (stay, yeah yeah now)


Caramel-coated pseudo happy  
Call her sticky wicked  
Will she answer agin today or pray that love'll kick it?  
Kick it love, see her little baby  
Hey girl, she don't remember your name  
Kick it love, mama gettin' busy  
Got no time 4 games  
Sticky wicked  
She just got a pair of tickets to the opera in her mind  
No applause, no encore if she dies  
CHORUS  
Kick it love, visions of her childhood  
When her heart was gold  
Sticky wicked  
Tell me people what reason's good enough 2  
Die before you're old? Kick it love, covenants of promise lay before your eyes  
Stick wicked will trick you, lick you, then it kicks you aside!  
CHORUS  
People crashing in the middle of the day  
When you wake up sticky wicked don't go away  
Sticky wicked  
Pretty stick wicked  
(Scenario of a mother who can't remember her daughter's name)  
Hey little baby, what's your name?  
Oh ain't she cute?  
Mama got 2 run today  
I don't have time 4 games  
No don't worry about me, I'm alright  
I'm alright, I'm alright  
caramel-coated pseudo happy  
Call her sticky wicked  
People crashing in the middle of the day  
When you wake up sticky wicked don't go away  
If you want it, help is here today  
There's a better God, don't you wanna play?  
Sticky wicked, love'll kick it  
Sticky wicked, love'll kick it  


You're welcome, stop on by  
You know I'll be there baby  
To dry your eyes  
Though I get tired, yeah of bein' that second guy  
Don't be no fool baby, you 'bout to lose your old standby  
  
Is the material things that he's givin'?  
Can you truly say that you're happy livin'?  
  
I'm the one that's givin'  
Boy, I don't want to hurt your feelings  
  
Stop on, stop on, stop on, stop on by  
You're welcome, stop on by  
One day, one day, one day, one day  
I might be the one to make you cry  
Don't take for granted  
I'll always be there  
Cause there's somebody somewhere, yeah  
That can truly need me  
  
Is the material things that he's givin'?  
Can you truly say that you're happy livin'?  
  
I'm the one that's givin'  
Boy, I don't want to hurt your feelings  
  
Stop on, stop on, stop on, stop on by


Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together,  
Keeps rainin' all the time  
  
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just can't get my poor self together,  
I'm weary all the time  
So weary all the time  
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.  
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.  
  
All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.  
Can't go on, every thing I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
  
Since my man and I ain't together,  
Keeps rainin' all the time


Take me, oh I need it now  
Shake me to love somehow  
I need warm embraces, yes I do  
I need smiling faces to look into  
I know that time erases the wounds of man  
  
Love is not all I crave  
I know there's a world to save  
But I've always done my best  
And I think I've passed every test  
  
But there's something about a brand new heart  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
I need a stranger to love  
Send me a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past behind  
My past behind, my past behind (mmm, my past)  
My past behind, my past behind  
  
I know that love may not come  
But if I can dream like everyone  
I'd dream the warming feelin' of an early spring  
I'd dream the magic elation a touch can bring  
I wanna capture the feelin of a newborn heart  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
Send me a stranger to love  
I need a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past--- behind......  
My past behind, my past behind, yeah yeah, yeah  
My past behind, my past behind  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
I wanna stranger to love, oh yeah  
Send me a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past, wanna throw it out the door......  
My past behind  
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby, my baby, yeah  
My past behind  
My past behind, my past behind  
  
I've been lookin' for a brand new mind  
There's somethin bout a brand new start


I'd never forget those nameless years  
Street sounds whirling through my mind  
Trouble was often in the air  
So we thought to forget our despair  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I play you a song (Play me a song, play me a song)  
Cause my heart and soul  
Will carry, carry on  
  
City life's the only way  
Street corners and billiard halls  
Was my home away  
Lesson's learned that still help me today  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I've seen it all (play me a song, play me a song)  
Hit men and thieves and many a brawl  
But as you will see I still stand tall  
  
It was such a small space and time  
I would never knew that I would find  
A musical past for all to see exciety to ecstasy  
  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I've seen it all (play me a song, play me a song)  
...........................  
But as you can see I still stand tall  
  
It was such a small space and time  
I would never knew that I would find  
A musical past for all to see exciety to ecstasy  
  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
  
Cause I'm a street player  
And I've seen it all (Play me a song, play me a song)  
The people love your soul  
Don't let them down  
Play your guitar  
Play that funky music, child


If you don't believe what I say  
You won't believe I'm not that way  
And I never meant to turn the hurt around  
I would be a fool to lose the love I'd found  
And if you take me back, I'll let you know  
  
I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me  
  
If you heard the whole thing before  
Then once again, I'll tell you more  
I would be a fool to ever let you go  
Oh I had to go away to finally know  
How much I need you back, I need your love  
  
I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be  
You're the light inside of me

I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be  
You're the light inside of me

Come back to me, come back to me  
I'll take you back, if you come back to me  
Come back to me  
  
If you come back to me  
Come back to me, come back to me  
I'll take you back  
If you come back to me, come back to me  
  
(stronger, stronger) stronger than before  
I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (stronger, stronger)  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me,  
Come back to me, come back to me  
  
(stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before,  
I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (stronger, stronger)  
By the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me,  
Come back to me, come back to me  
  
(stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before,  
I will love you even more

I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (oh yeah, yeah)  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me,  
Come back to me, come back to me


I will love you anyway  
Even if you cannot stay  
I think you are the one for me  
Here is where you ought to be  
I just want to satisfy you  
Though you're not mine  
I can't deny you  
Don't you hear me talking baby?  
Love me now or I'll go crazy  
  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Yes, you are  
  
I wish you were my lover  
But you act so undercover  
I'll love you child my whole life long  
Be it right, or be it wrong  
I'm only what you make me, baby  
Don't walk away, don't be so shady  
Don't want your mind, don't want your money  
These words I say, they may sound funny, but  
  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Yes, you are, yes you are  
  
You are my heat  
You are my fire  
You make me weak with strong desire  
To love you child my whole life long  
Be it right, or be it wrong  
  
I just want to satisfy you  
Though you're not mine  
I can't deny you  
Don't you hear me talking baby  
Love me now or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now, or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now, or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now, or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now


Hurry, hurry, hurry  
Take the A-train  
To find the quickest way to get to Harlem  
  
If you should take the A-train  
You'll find you get right where you goin'  
If you hurry  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry  
Night's coming  
Can't you hear the rails a-humming  
  
If you should take the A-train  
You'll find to get away  
With a hurry  
  
If you should take the A-train  
You'll find you get right where you goin'  
If you hurry  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry  
Night's coming  
Can't you hear the rails a-humming


Did you say that I've got a lot to learn  
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn  
Since this is the perfect spot to learn  
Teach me tonight  
  
Starting with the ABC of it  
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it  
Help me solve the mystery of it  
Teach me tonight  
  
The sky's a blackboard high above you  
And if a shooting star goes by  
I'll use that star to write "I love you"  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing isn't very clear my love  
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love  
Graduation's almost here my love  
You'd better teach me tonight  
  
I've played loves scenes in a flick or two  
And I've also met a chick or two  
But I still can learn a trick or two  
Hey teach me tonight  
  
I who thought I knew the score of it  
Kind of think I should know much more of it  
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it  
Hey teach me tonight  
  
The midnight hours come slowly creeping  
When there's no one there but you  
There must be more to life than sleeping  
Single in a bed for two  
  
What I need most is post graduate  
What I feel is hard to articulate  
If you want me to matriculate  
You'd better teach me tonight  
  
What do you get for lessons  
Teach me, come on and teach me, teach me tonight


Verse 1:  
I'm gonna make you love  
If it's the last thing I do  
I'm gonna make you with  
That there were two of you  
Bridge 1:  
I think you're gonna need help  
'cause I've been saving my love  
For nobody but you  
I'll make you melt  
Like the snow in the summer  
'cause you're blowin' my mind  
I know it's gonna be all better  
When you touch me (oh, oh, give it to me baby)  
Love can't wait, you'll never get away  
Chorus:  
Tearin' it up, tearin' it up  
You were tearin' it up  
Tearin' it up, tearin' it up  
You were tearin' it up  
Verse 1  
Bridge 2:  
Sittin' here checkin' you out  
I know your moves  
And all your grooves  
And there's no doubt  
That you give off a love vibe  
That's all the way live  
It's a woman's prerogative to change her mind  
Hurry up, please stop wastin' time  
Just give up, you'll never get away  
Chaka: I'm gonna make you love me  
Male: girl, I'm gonna make you love me too  
Chaka: I'm gonna make you love me, boy  
Chorus  
I know you can make it,  
Keep holdin' on because times is hard  
It feels so good  
To get close to you, can't give it up  
Let me satisfy your life's desires  
I wanna take you there  
Opportunity knocks with passion and emotion  
Male: I'm gonna make you love me  
Chaka: ooh, say it again and again and again and again  
Male: I'm gonna make you love me if it's the last thing I do  
Chaka: I'm gonna make you wish that there were two of you  
Gonna make you love me, babe, gonna make you love me (7x)  
Gonna make you love me, babe, again and again and a-  
Gonna make you love me, babe, gonna make you love me  
Gonna make you love me, babe, again and again and a-

Stay right here with me sweet baby  
Stay here for a little while  
For a while  
I'm sitting at my window  
And I look  
Where are you  
I wonder if you even know  
You belong to me  
No matter where you roam  
You've got to take me  
I'm givin' my everything  
Givin' all my time  
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please  
(Won't you)  
Even if I have to wait all night  
I don't even care  
I've waited all my life  
Let me love you  
I'm givin' my everything  
Givin' all my time  
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please  
(Won't you)  


You ain't got no kind of feeling inside  
I got something that will sure 'nuff set your stuff on fire  
You refuse to put anything before your pride  
I got something that will knock all your pride aside  
  
Tell me something good (tell me, tell me, tell me)  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me something good (tell me, tell me, tell me)  
Tell me that you like it, yeah  
  
Got no time is what you're known to say  
I'll make you wish there were 48 hours to each day  
Problem is you ain't been loved like you should  
What I got to give will sure 'nuff do you good


Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum  
You came along and everything's startin' to hum  
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come  
  
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?  
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine  
  
A-Wait till the warm-up's underway  
Wait till our lips have met  
And wait till you see that sunshine day  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
  
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?  
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine  
  
Come the day you're mine  
I'm gonna teach you to fly  
We've only tasted the wine  
We're gonna drain the cup dry  
  
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround  
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground  
  
A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace  
Wait till I draw you near  
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place  
Ain't nothin' like it here  
  
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?  
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine  
  
Come the day you're mine  
And you're gonna be mine


Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!


In this ever-changing world  
Where things become unfurled  
And tethered  
Like a lioness in her pride  
I was gonna stay by your side  
Forever  
  
As a planet keeps her moon  
Your love I had assumed  
And taken  
And if this love can't come to pass  
Then I would be alas  
Forsaken  
  
[Chorus]  
The drama of the chase  
The look upon your face  
Make up your mind  
It would be a waste  
If you didn't love me  
It would be the drama of all time  
  
If I'm not good enough for you  
What else could I do?  
I could change  
You know, they say like wine  
You get better with passin' time  
How strange ?.  
I wish that in your eyes  
You saw me like the others  
See me  
I could never say enough  
Darlin' just how much I  
Wish you'd keep me  
  
[Chorus]  
Drama, drama of all time  
It's been ten long years  
Since I fell in love so dear  
It's got to be the drama of all time  
Called you on the telephone  
And wondered if you were alone  
It's got to be the drama of all time  
When I called you back, it was busy  
What was that?  
It's a drama, drama of all time  
Who were you with last night?  
Busy, busy, you must be busier  
Than a one-legged man in a kick fight  
Got to be the drama of all time  
Drama, drama of all time


So I walk a little too fast and I drive a little too fast  
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do  
At the end of a love affair?  
  
So I talk a little too much and I laugh a little too much  
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd  
So that people are apt to stare  
  
Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely  
And low as can be?  
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all!  
  
So I smoke a little too much and I drink a little too much  
And the tunes I request aren't always the best  
But the ones where the trumpets blare!  
  
So I go at a maddening pace,  
And I pretend that it's taking your place  
But what else can you do, at the end of a love affair?  
  
So I smoke a little too much and I drink a little too much  
And the tunes I request aren't always the best  
But the ones where the trumpets blare!  
  
So I go at a maddening pace,  
And I pretend that it's taking your place  
But what else can you do, at the end of a love affair?


I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view, then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it, I heard it, I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a message in the middle of the bottom  
You see 'em, you love 'em, you got 'em  
There's a proper time to pick 'em when they're fallen  
Just listen, you'll hear 'em a-callin  
There's a special way to know you got his lovin'  
Can't you feel it, you ought to, you taught him  
There's a special time for lovin' and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone  
  
I have a feelin' deep inside that I've got you  
I'll keep you. why not? it'll make me feel better  
If there's a woman on this earth who should love you  
It's me boy, don't fight it, admit it, you love it  
If you think there's someone else who can move you  
I'll lose you, no problem, you're free to go get her  
I just refuse to let a lady step in on my show  
If you choose, do it now or forget it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view, then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it, I heard it, I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a special time for lovin' and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone.  
  
Message in the middle of the bottom [Repeat: x5]


I had known you for quite some time  
But the thought of love never crossed my mind  
It seemed to be on the other side of the world  
  
Too many times had I loved  
And not cared at all about "love"  
Just to have something to do  
Then I saw a different you  
"And oh my!"  
  
There's so many stories of love  
All with the wonders of love  
And so very sad I would be  
'Cause none belonged to me  
  
Could be it's all for the best  
So I finally let it rest  
Sad but I felt that maybe  
Love wasn't meant for me  
  
So crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you, everything is right  
And loneliness is the other side of the world  


Hey sister  
I never knew which way to go  
Everybody had an answer  
So I said  
Go lecture someone, go lecture someone  
  
I could feel it in my heart babe  
I couldn't scream, I couldn't shout  
I had to find out in my own way  
Ran into someone - ran into someone  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I had to learn to trust myself  
I had to learn just when to say no  
Always trying to please someone else  
I had to let go, I had to let go  
  
The world is filled of many wonders  
I had to look to heaven for my own  
I saw the star that I was unter  
Lord lead me back home, lead me back home  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I can look at myself and I'm not afraid  
I have finally learned how to love  
I can feel everything that I've never felt  
And I'm sure now that I've always known


I was just minding my business  
Life was a beautiful song  
Didn't have a care nor worry  
Then you had to come along  
I fell in love with you first time  
I looked into them there eyes  
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'  
With them there eyes  
They make me feel happy, they make me blue  
No stallin'  
I'm fallin'  
Going in a big way for sweet little you  
My heart is jumpin'  
You sure started somethin'  
With them there eyes  
You'd better watch them if you're wise  
They sparkle, they bubble  
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble  
You're overworkin' 'em  
There's danger lurkin' in  
Them there eyes  
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'  
Maybe you think I'm all lies  
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in  
Them there eyes  
I fell in love with you first time  
I looked into them there eyes  
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'  
With them there eyes  
They make me feel happy, they make me blue  
No stallin'  
I'm fallin'  
Going in a big way for sweet little you  
My heart is jumpin'  
You sure started somethin'  
With them there eyes  
You'd better watch them if you're wise  
They sparkle  
They bubble  
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble  
You're overworkin' 'em  
There's danger lurkin' in  
Them there eyes


This is a story of mind, soul and heart  
Come to think of it, don't know where to start  
I'd take it from the top but we don't have that much time  
So I'm breakin' off a piece of this crazy life of mine  
As a little girl, I had a stubborn mind  
Bonnie and me were wild most of the time  
I used to sing for mama's company  
I guess that was the start of the woman I came to be  
Sometimes young, yet so old  
Warm to the touch, intellectually cold  
I love the how and why of it  
Thank God, the pieces seem to fit  
Pieces seem to fit in this crazy life of mine  
Never will forget from whence I came  
I have some regrets but I made myself a name  
Two times a mother and as many times wed  
Tough times were around me but better times ahead  
If your heart can handle these words I've said  
I see you and me in this crazy life of mine  
Mine  
Gotcha  


I'm puttin' on my makeup  
It's time to wake up  
The owners of the night are calling me  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
To pull out the happy feeling  
Something special's in the air for me  
  
The night is mine  
I'm gonna keep it just right  
An angel in my pocket, right?  
Feels so right  
This mirror's tellin' no lie  
Gonna let this magic shine  
  
[CHORUS]  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine  
  
I feel like winning  
i don't know the reason  
Something telling me to let it ride  
Got me rockin' and reeling  
I don't know what the deal is  
Something special I just can't describe  
  
The night is mine  
I'm gonna keep it just right  
On my way to paradise  
Feels so fine  
Feels just like the first time  
Gonna gonna let this magic shine  
  
[CHORUS]  
This is my night, this is my night, this is my night  
The night is young, let it shine (come out)  
This is, this is my night, this, this is my night!  
This is my my my my my night, my my my...  
  
This feels so right  
This mirror's tellin' no lie  
I'm gonna let this magic shine  
Let it shine, let it shine  
  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)  
This is my night (my night)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine, oh)  
My night, let it shine This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine on me, shine on me)


The time has come  
For closing books, and long last looks must end  
And as I leave  
I know that I am leaving my best friend  
A friend who taught me right from wrong  
And weak from strong  
That's a lot to learn  
What, what can I give you in return?  
  
If you wanted the moon  
I would try to make a start  
But i, would rather let me give my heart  
To you, with love  
  
Those schoolgirl days  
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone, yeah  
But in my mind  
I know that they live on and on and on and on  
But how do you thank someone  
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?  
Well it's not easy  
But I'll try  
  
If you wanted the sky  
I would write across the sky in letters  
That would soar a thousand feet high  
To you, with love  
Those awkward years have hurried by  
Why did they fly, fly away  
Why is it sir children, grow up to be people one day?  
What takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside?  
What, what is there that I can buy?  
  
If you wanted the world  
I'd surround it with a wall I'd scrawl  
These words withe letters ten feet tall  
To you, with love


You know our love is driftin'  
We have fallen from its grace  
We've got to face the situation  
Put things in their place  
  
You're still the man  
You know just where you stand  
But the way you felt for me is gone  
There's no more truth to your song  
  
[Chorus]  
But I've got so much love for you  
It's too much love  
So much love for you  
It's too much love  
So much love for you  
It's too much love  
And I just don't want to throw it away  
  
I've got to sacrifice my feelings  
To make you find your own  
I think it's time to end it  
You might be better off alone  
  
Oh, you're still the man  
You know just where you stand  
But the way you felt for me is gone  
There's no more truth to your song  
  
(There's something you've got to know)  
When it's over, it's over  
If it's done, then, baby, it's done  
But there's nowhere to go  
If we leave it all behind  
  
Too much love  
Too much love  
Too much love


Bridge:  
When your groove comes down on you  
You can do what you wanna do  
When your groove comes down on yo  
You can do what you wanna do  
  
There's a lot of dancin' going round  
You tried them all and put some down  
Everybody's got their own way of movin'  
It don't matter as long as we're groovin'  
  
Chorus:  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
  
Bridge  
  
Can you move it around and let me see it?  
Just walk over here and I'll get down with ya  
Keep on now, let's keep groovin'  
You better come on and get down to it  
  
Chorus  
  
It's a dance, if you wanna dance  
It's a dance, if you wanna dance  
Keep on movin' around, let me see it  
Just walk over here and I'll get down with ya  
  
Keep puttin' it out, let's keep groovin'  
Everybody come on get down do it  
It's a dance, if you wanna dance  
  
Walk on  
The rockway


Things have been goin' wrong long enough to know  
Everything is right  
Been walkin' in the dark long enough to know  
Finally seen the light  
Been losin' long enough to know when I've finally won  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun  
  
I've cried enough tears to know  
This feeling's called a smile  
Been bottom rung long enough to know  
When I'm doin' it in style  
Been runnin' so long I know  
There's no more need to run  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun  
  
Oh, the wind is at my back  
And I'm sailin' on a ship that's overdue  
Well I've blown so many chances  
I ain't gonna blow this one with you  
I've seen enough bad times to know  
Good times have begun  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun


Life is very short  
And there's no time  
For fussing and fighting  
So I'll ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Do I have to keep on talking  
Until I can't go on  
Boy you see it your way  
You run the risk of knowing  
That our love will soon be gone  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Hear what you're saying  
You can get it wrong  
And still you think that it's alright  
Hear what I'm saying  
We can work it out  
And when it's straight, we'll say good night  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short  
And there's no time  
For fussing and fighting  
I've have ways thought  
That it's a crime  
So I will ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Only time will tell if I am right  
Or if I am wrong  
Boy you see it your way  
There's a chance that we might fall apart  
Before too long  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short  
And there's no time, no time  
For fussing and fighting  
I've have ways thought  
That it's a crime (dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty)  
So I will ask you once again


Hello, hello  
Is there anyone?  
You don't know  
How I've searched, searched the world for you  
Hello, hello  
Is there any place  
A thousand hearts, a million miles of dreams and thoughts of you  
  
All right  
It's been a long time comin' to you  
All right  
I'm a-comin' for you, well  
All we need, we need is a dream

All we need  
  
Hello, hello

To help you make it through

It's been a long time gettin' to you  
All right  
I'm a-comin' for you, you know it's true, well  
All we need, we need is a dream  
All we need is a night

Don't need you!  
I don't live in this town, don't trust you  
Don't trust anyone around, can't stand you  
Ain't gonna stick around  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
  
I hate you, and I hate this town  
I mean you, and this pitiful town  
I hate you, you just make me laugh  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
  
I hate you, you like me? (No!)  
You like our music, now don't yah? (No!)  
It's such a pity now you want me to go! (Go!)  
  
A lot of talk, not enough action  
Lot of lies, but no real reaction  
Lot of ways, but no real emotion  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
  
I hate you, you like me? (No!)  
You like our music, now don't yah? (No!)  
It's such a pity now you want me to go! (Go!)  
  
You're so pretty  
You're so pretty

Love your hair (ha ha ha)  
You're so pretty  
You're so pretty  
Love your makeup  
Love your nose  
Love your eyes  
Love your clothes  
You're pretty useless!  
  
I hate you, and I hate this town  
I mean you, and this pitiful town  
I hate you, you just make me laugh  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)

You like our music, now don't you? (No!)  
It's such a pity now you want me to go! (Go!)  
  
I was born to raise hell...


Ooh what you fell into  
It's really nothin' new  
Well it's the same thing every day  
I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time  
With what I do and say  
I've tried and tried to right my wrongs  
And turn ?em all around  
Turn ?em around, turn ?em around, turn'em around  
  
Busted  
Busted for what I did  
I didn't think it so wrong  
Busted  
Busted for what I did  
I didn't think it so wrong  
Busted  
Busted for what I did  
I didn't think it so wrong  
I didn't, I didn't think it so wrong, well  
  
Well I made a big mistake  
But baby that's the breaks  
I can't erase what's done is done  
Don't have the best of luck  
I think enough's enough  
And my mind is on the run  
Time to go, time to show  
We'll turn it around  
Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around  


Goin' to a party,  
Meet me out after school.  
Well we go to a place  
Where the jive is really cool.  
And if the band stops a playin'  
There's a jukebox in the hall.  
  
Well put your blue dress on,  
And your folks all gone.  
You'll sure give the guys a ball.  
  
[Chorus]  
Get that real guitar boy shakin',  
I'm a California man,  
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'  
I'm a California man.  
  
Well I cross my mamma so bad  
And this a woman's just a making me mad.  
So I don't care if your legs start aching,  
I'm a California man.  
Oh my, I'm a California man.  
  
Oh my legs start to shiver  
When I hear you call my name.  
Well, my knees keep a knocking,  
And my bow tie's bustin' out  
  
An' when we take off fine,  
An' my jeans are way down low.  
When I waggle my hips  
It's making me feel like a king of rock n' roll  
  
[Chorus]


Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
So you want to believe  
  
Everything that you read  
And you think that you're makin' the grade  
(and) just when you're getting it made  
You're still in love with her  
She'd love you to kiss her  
Hopin' you'll miss her  
  
By takin' your mind off the load  
Just when you're ready to go  
You turn your back on her  
You just got your mind on the things ahead  
At last you're gonna be free  
You'll only miss her  
Just after you kiss her  
  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
  
So you turn on the smiles  
'cause you think of the time  
And nobody knows who you are  
You don't think you'll get very far  
I don't even know your name  
At last they accept you  
In case you go next year  
  
And ask you to reach for the sky  
And just when you're ready to die  
They turn their back on you  
So they put you on ice  
In survival hotel  
  
And wish you would die from the cold  
When all you want is a night alone  
  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
  
Dancing, and the song you sing  
Dancing, every move you make  
Dancing, makes my body go  
Dancing, right across the floor  
Dancing  
Dancing  
Dancing


Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head  
  
I'm gonna live on a mountain  
Way down under in Australia  
It's either that or suicide  
It's such a strange strain on you  
Oh, i got a mind  
Over you it's not the first time  
Oh, i got a mind  
  
Rainbow's crawling on a midday sun  
But i've been lucky you're the only one  
Sunday's calling, you'll be number one  
It's such a strange strain on you  
Oh, you think of Jesus Christ  
You walk on water but don't bet your life, oh no  
All you walk is a fine line  
It's such a strange strain on you  
  
Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head  
  
Too many people want to save the world  
Another problem is it a boy or girl  
Some say the weekend is the only world  
It's such a strange strain on you  
Oh, i've got a mind  
Over you it's not the first time  
All you walk is a fine line  
It's such a strange strain on you  
  
Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head  
Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head


When I was a little boy  
I dreamed of playing with bigger toys  
I just knew what I just knew  
What else was I supposed to do?  
  
Scream, dream, scream, dream  
Scream, dream, scream, dream  
Scream, dream  
  
Another notch on the bedpost  
Another notch on your gun  
Put your lips on the list of life  
Another notch on your gun  
  
Years gone by and now I'm eight  
The girl next door, I can't tolerate  
She found a patient, oh, I give in  
She's the nurse with the medicine  
  
Scream, dream, scream, dream  
Scream, dream, scream, dream  
Scream, dream  
  
Another notch on the bedpost  
Another notch on your gun  
Put your lips on the list of life  
You had it all but you're not the only one  
You're not the only boy  
  
Violins, I can hear you call  
I found out you don't care at all  
Violins, tell me, what to do  
All I want is to play with you  
  
The day that I turned twenty-one  
Thought I was the biggest gun  
Lusted from your face to view  
What else was I supposed to do?  
  
Scream, dream, scream, dream  
Scream, dream, scream, dream  
Scream, dream  
  
Another notch on the bedpost  
Another notch on your gun  
Put your lips on the list of life  
You had it all but you're not the only boy  
You're not the only one  
  
Violins, I can hear you call  
I found out you don't care at all  
Violins, tell me, what to do  
All I want is to play with you


(alternate intro)  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Let it in your heart  
  
Everything works if you let it  
If you let it in your heart  
Yeah everything works if you let it  
If you let it in your heart  
  
She is the girl of his dreams  
He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'  
He's got a pain in his heart he feels like crying  
So lonesome for love he feels like dying  
  
But don't stop the dream  
He can fix it, I know he can  
He's the world's world's greatest  
At the work that he does  
When he moves on down the line  
  
She is the girl of his dreams  
He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'  
He'd love to look inside her heart  
And see if she agrees  
  
But don't stop the dream  
He can fix it, I know he can  
He's good, he's great  
At the work that he does  
And there's magic in the air  
  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Let it in your heart  
  
Good times, bad times don't know what to do  
Half the time and all the time  
Don't know if it's true  
Someday, somewhere know if it's true  
She'll look inside her heart and decide  
It's really you, whoa  
  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Let it in your heart  
  
Everything works if you let it  
If you let it in your heart  
Yeah everything works if you let it  
If you let it in your heart


You know they say you best be careful what you're lookin' for  
Everything you want in life to the girl nextdoor  
Well it could happen to you now anyday  
When someone you don't know could blow you away  
  
Better watch out who you trust  
And be careful what you say  
'Cause you know you got too much  
To give it away, give it away  
Give it away, give it away  
  
Along came Mary Jane and her friends  
Knockin'at your door  
Lookin' for some long-term suckers  
Like she's has before  
  
Did you notice me as I noticed you  
From your face  
Don't look so long  
Cause' you're gone from your place  
  
Better watch out who you trust  
And be careful what you say  
'Cause you know you got too much  
To give it away  
  
Now I don't care where you come from  
Or what you do or say  
'Cause you've got way too much to give it away  
  
Something clicked and you're kickin' today  
Something kicked in today  
Feels so good, feels just right  
Gotta find that fun everyday  
  
Don't give it away, give it away  
Give it away, give it away  
Don't throw it away, give it away  
Don't dream it away, give it away!


Hot love if you want it  
Got the time if you need it  
Be around when you call me  
I'll be around, be around for the ball  
  
Hot love is for sale  
And the time is just right  
Hot love keeps you healthy,  
Ooh, hot love, hot love, it's nice.  
  
And when I see a little temperature rise  
You know I wasn't surprised  
See you were smiling, oh  
Hot love will burn  
Hot love will burn your heart  
  
Hot love if you want it  
Got the time if you need it  
Be around when you call me.  
I'll be around, be around for the ball  
  
And when I see a little temperature rise  
You know I wasn't surprised  
See, that you were smiling  
Hot love will burn  
Hot love will burn you  
  
I'm selling this, hot love for you  
And for you I'll give it away  
I know you'll need it every day  
Today and tonight

Hey, why won't you let me inside of you tonight?  
  
Hot love will burn  
Hot love will burn your heart

Hot love will burn your heart


Never started out first  
Never finished last  
Like to change the pace  
Like to change it fast  
And I'm ready to try  
Just can't sit around here too long  
I can feel the wheels are spinning strong  
Does anyone feel the same as me  
Does anyone disagree  
Well how 'bout you  
I said goodbye to bad luck  
I've had enough  
But I know I'll be back, dear  
Didn't fall off the side of the earth  
Gonna turn it all around  
How 'bout you, how 'bout me, how 'bout you  
  
Do you like your love soft and warm  
Do you like it hard, hot and long  
Like you're ready to die  
Sometimes I feel all wound up  
Head starts spinnin', it'll never stop  
Does anyone feel the same as me  
Does anyone disagree  
Well how 'bout you  
I said bad times kiss them goodbye  
I want changes, but  
I know I'll be back, dear  
Didn't fall off the side of the earth  
Gonna turn it all around  
How 'bout you, how 'bout me, how 'bout you  
  
I know I'll be back, dear  
Didn't fall off the side of the earth  
Gonna turn it all around  
How 'bout you, how 'bout me, how 'bout you

Well I saw you today and realized  
How I missed my peace of mind  
I feel your breath in my ear  
But late at night it's you I always think about  
That little girl inside of you I once knew  
I should have known better  
Still the smell of you was on my face  
But you were too busy  
To notice me last night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
I can't take it  
I can't make it alone  
Oh no, ooh, oh no  
  
Then I tell myself I'll put you down  
Don't want to see your face around  
Don't call me up anymore  
When I hear your voice it's in my ear  
You're kissing on the phone  
It makes it all come clear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I try to tell myself  
Don't need you anymore  
Don't want you hanging around my door, oh no  
  
Now I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
If it's wrong or right  
I can't take it, I can't make it alone  
  
You know how I tried  
I can't take it, I can't make it alone  
I try tell myself don't need you anymore  
I can't take it alone, I can't make it alone  
Oh baby, my pretty baby  
I can't take it alone, I can't make it alone


Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Back against the wall  
But you know the weekend's on it's way  
Waiting for the fall  
But you know the weekend's on it's way  
  
I got my eyes on you  
I see some trouble comin' into view  
Don't you know that I'm doin' alright on my own  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh  
I can't understand it  
What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Walking down the hall please stop in anytime of day  
Let's do more than talk  
About the weekend games we play  
  
I set my sights on you  
Let's make tonight a deep interview  
Don't you know that I'm doin' alright on my own  
  
I ain't out to destroy you, oh  
I'm comin' out to enjoy you, oh  
It's just a case of paranoia in my brain  
  
I've got my eyes on you  
I've got my gun loaded just for two  
If you knew my feelings  
I'm tellin' the truth  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh  
I can't understand it  
What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh

What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh

I'll get home early from work  
If you say that you love me.  
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I,  
See you cryin' (cryin, cryin').  
Oh, Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I,

If you think my name  
What gives you the right  
Couldn't take the place  
To be with you tonight  
When I fall asleep  
And I dream all night  
No matter where I go  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime

Get closer  
Closer to me  
Got stories I can't speak  
Got secrets I can't keep  
Can't hide what you're doing to me  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you

But I'd never wait so long  
When I fall asleep  
And I dream all night  
No matter where I go  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
Sleep awake  
All day all night

But I can't believe its true  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you

But I'd never wait so long  
  


Girl it's alright

And you need me  
Swallow your pride  
And there's nothing to hide  
Do you need me?  
  
Such a long long time  
I've been waiting for a sign  
Say you need me  
I've been dreaming of the day  
When I hear you say  
Say you need me  
  
I believe in you, you believe in me  
But I can't feel it in my heart  
So what's wrong with you  
What's the matter with me  
And how come we're so far apart, yeah?  
  
I can stand a little hurt  
And I can stand a lot of pain  
Well now we can work it out alright  
If you need me yeah  
  
Can we be serious, can you keep a secret  
Hold it inside between you and I, can we keep it  
Been thinking of a way just to get you to say  
Say you need me

And I can't feel it in my heart

Best friend  
(are. Nielsen, are. Zander, T. Petersson)  
  
Mmmm  
When the moon came up  
And the sun went down  
All I could see was a national frown  
It was pounded from flesh  
And harder than steel  
Pretty in pink that's just how I feel  
Leave me alone 'cause I'm my best friend  
  
If you wanna be with me I'll be there til the end  
Til the end of time and time again  
Just leave me alone 'cause I'm my best friend  
Yeah, yeah  
'cause I'm my best friend now  
'cause I'm my best friend now  
  
All I got is might and will  
If all I got is might and will  
Can't slow down 'cause down we'll go  
Where I step you don't wanna know  
Round round round we'll go  
Where I step is where I wanna go  
Go go go go  
Where I wanna be is where I wanna go  
Lofty thoughts high ideals  
Lofty skirts  
Is what appeals  
This baby is no Baby Ruth  
He was too smart for her  
She was so damned cute  
I'm sick and tired can't be late  
I'm so damn mad I can't keep straight  
Time and time and time again  
Leave me alone 'cause I'm my best friend yeah  
Leave me alone 'cause I'm my best friend yeah  
I'm my best friend yeah

Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain  
  
I can't see anymore  
Now I've gotten tunnel vision  
I can't be anyone  
I just got no direction  
I can't see anything  
But I don't need glasses on  
I can't think anymore  
I'm just a nervous wreck  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain  
  
I can't see anymore  
Always buckle under pressure  
I can't be anyone  
The slightest thing will set me off  
I can't feel anything  
I'm on pins and I'm on needles  
I can't think anymore  
I've lost my appetite  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain

I took your photographs, I threw them all away  
I put your calls on hold 'cause I got nothin' to say  
Hangin' on to you, that was my first mistake  
Yeah, yeah  
  
But some things you can never let go  
Some things you can never let go  
  
You took the credit cards, you took the bank account  
You took my sanity. you've got me all drawn out  
I'd give it all away to get you off my mind  
Yeah, yeah  
  
But some things you can never let go  
Some things you should never let 'em show  
Some things you can never let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go of my heart  
  
I took your photographs, I threw them all aside  
Forget your so called friends, I kissed 'em all goodbye  
If I walk away, would you be satisfied?  
Yeah, yeah  
  
But some things you can never let go  
Some things you should never let show  
Some things you can never let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go of my heart  
  
Some things you can never let go  
Some things you can never let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go  
Gotta let go  
Gotta let go  
Gotta let go of my heart


Heads down, buried in the sand  
She's back now, I better wash my hands  
She talks like a man gettin' higher than I can  
Lovin' me when I'm in a rock band  
Let her go  
  
She's living in shadows  
Waits there in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
  
Close the window, it's time to shut the door  
Say a prayer now, and get down on the floor  
There's a howling wind blowing through my brain  
Moving in slow, just like the hurricane  
Let her go  
  
She's living in shadows  
Waits there in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
Oh let her go  
Yeah, let her go  
Let her go  
  
She can't fall in love  
Her heart's cold as ice now  
Let her go  
  
She can't cry for love  
There's no tears left inside for one to show  
Let her go  
  
She waits in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
  
She's living in shadows  
Waits there in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
Yeah let her go  
Yeah let her go  
Let her go


Well I've been around here for way too long  
It's really time to go  
But there's reasons for my madness  
Though it doesn't show  
I sit and wait and contemplate what am I gonna say  
When the telephone rings I hear her voice  
She speaks that special way  
Alright now, little sister  
Wait all night for the call  
She's alright with me  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
Something's flowing through my veins  
What it is I don't know  
It's a three alarm fire in my heart  
Hope it doesn't show  
Call the doctor, call the judge  
Justice of the peace  
Pluck this flower in full bloom  
This relative's no niece  
Alright now, little sister  
Wait all night for the call  
  
She's alright with me  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
I'm at the crossroads waiting for a call  
Back against the wall again  
But I'm not just expecting anyone  
When I get the call that says it all  
She says yeah (robin, I'll be right over)  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
Oh, I like it when you talk dirty to me  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister


I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
  
I got hot but never got burned  
Well all I know is she should have learned  
Get too close you'll fall right in  
You should have known, you can't do that now  
  
I see what's goin' on  
I've known it all along  
I've seen what's goin' on  
  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
  
When I'm hot she says she's not  
Don't get too close, she's over the top  
Think by now, well, I would have learned  
She's all talk, I really got burned now  
  
I see what's goin' on  
I've known it all along  
I've seen what's goin' on  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah, oh yeah


Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  
Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  
There's a lot of things that seem to go 'round  
Like the world the love and the fun  
There's a lot of things that seem to go 'round  
Like the girls and the love I get numb  
Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  
Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  


No mercy  
No mercy  
No mercy  
  
In the midnight hush, the restless hours between dark and light  
In dreams we come together underneath the cover of the night  
You're holding out, but I'm holding on  
Can't wait until your resistance is gone  
  
No mercy, accept no defeat  
No mercy, 'til you're here with me  
  
Now the pressure's on  
You can run away but you can't hide  
You might as well surrender,  
The walls are closing in on every side  
I'm getting closer, now, there's no escape  
Victory is written all over my face  
  
No mercy, accept no defeat  
No mercy, 'til you're here with me  
No mercy, I won't give in no!  
No mercy, 'til you let me in  
  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't let go  
  
No mercy,  
No mercy, no  
Ohh oh  
No mercy,  
  
You're holding out, but I'm holding on  
Can't wait until your resistance is gone  
No mercy, accept no defeat  
No mercy, 'til you're here with me  
  
No mercy, until you let me in  
No mercy, no, I'll never give in  
No mercy, I won't let you go no!  
No mercy, and I want you to know, oh  
No mercy

Saturday at midnight  
See you at the red light  
Don't want to be alone  
Saturday at midnight  
  
I can't wait for a call  
It's just not my style  
Been alone too long  
But in a little while  
When night closes in  
And lights are gettin' bright  
Makes it all worthwhile  
Makes it all worthwhile tonight  
  
Saturday at midnight  
See you at the red light (bad scene, man)  
Don't want to be alone  
Saturday at midnight  
  
I work hard every day  
Every day of my life  
My reward is to make a better life  
'cause I live for the weekend  
And what I want to do  
Is search for that someone  
So my dreams come true  
  
Saturday at midnight  
See you at the red light (bad scene, man)  
Don't want to be alone  
Saturday at midnight  
  
There's a lot of things  
That seem to go round  
Like the world and the love and the fun  
There's a lot of things  
That seem to go round  
But the girls and the love I get none  
  
Saturday at midnight (i don't want to go home)  
Saturday at midnight  
I can't wait for a call  
It's just not my style  
Been alone too long  
But in a little while  
When night closes in  
And lights are gettin' bright  
Makes it all worthwhile  
Makes it all worthwhile tonight  
  
Saturday at midnight (ha, ha, ha)  
See you at the red light (bad scene, man)  
Don't want to be alone


How does it feel to be better  
How does it feel to be on your own  
Oh tell me why did you take the time  
To tell me that you came to say goodbye  
  
Everybody wants to laugh  
When you feel bad  
Seems like the only way when the nights won't pass  
When you're so sad  
If you can't go back  
And you can't look down  
  
How does it feel to be better  
How does it feel to be on your own  
Oh tell me why did you take the time  
To tell me that you came to say goodbye  
  
Everything comes to mind  
It's a breakdown  
The way things seem to slide  
It's a free fall  
When you're so sad  
If you can't go back  
And you can't look down  
  
How does it feel to be better  
How does it feel to be on your own  
Oh tell me why did you take the time  
Walk away, tell those lies  
Why did you waste your time  
To tell me that you came to say goodbye


If I had a child  
I would shelter it from harm  
If I had a child  
I would hold it in my arms  
If I had a child  
I would love it as my own  
If I had a home  
  
If I had a mom  
I would shelter her from harm  
If I had my mother  
She would never lose her grace  
If I had a mother  
She would shelter me from harm  
Oh, if I had a mom  
  
If I had a love  
I would shelter it from a broken heart  
If I had a heart  
I'd surrender it to my love  
  
If I had my father  
He would smile  
If I had my dad  
He'd be so kind  
If I had a dad  
He would tell me I was good  
Oh, if I, if I  
If I had a dad  
Had my dad


I've been north,  
I've been east to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words  
And you show it  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I'll know  
Waste no time getting  
So close to you  
And you'll never run way  
When you find out why I wanted to find you  
  
Ooh baby need some brand new shoes  
Get out on the street  
You got nothing to lose  
You rock me and your crazy  
And everyone says it, yeah yeah  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
  
I've been up I've been down  
I've been weak I've been strong  
But I never met someone like you  
And you'll never run away  
When you find why I wanted to find you  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I'll know  
Waste no time getting  
So close to you  
All you Southern girls  
Got a way with your words

Yesterday feels like running away  
Feels like givin' the child gettin' lost losin' my mind  
I'm feelin' low and I got no place to go  
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up yeah yeah  
Oh yesterday feels like running away  
And I know, I'm givin' up my time to still love  
Still love love's got me blind  
My mind sees the things I don't know and I got no place to go  
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up  
Things I need to tell you love  
You'll be true I know  
There's still a chance for a better life  
Yes, I know


Two thousand years gone by and going strong  
Well never fear my love it won't be long  
You say you've had enough, it seems so wrong  
Now it's suicide, oh my love  
  
And now you know just why I'm here  
And now my eyes they see so clear  
No fear  
  
Where do we go from here, it's in your head  
So many tears we'll cry before we're dead  
Remember me my love and what we said  
I will stand by you all night long  
  
And now you know just why I'm here  
And now my eyes can see so clear  
Oh baby  
  
Just like the dreams you grow old and die  
No one pretends to know just why  
I feel the calm before the storm  
I'm here  
  
Kiss me again before you go  
There's something else that you should know  
My life will be hell without you my belle  
Oh, give all my love, my love


In the middle of the night  
I had a vision  
It was bigger than life  
Standing on the edge of my bed  
She said "come here, don't be afraid"  
Her tongue opened like a shot  
Oh bang bang  
Ten feet tall, laser eyes  
Killer body, killer thighs  
She drew me a fine line  
What's wrong what's right  
I didn't know what to think  
She seemed to know what to drink  
I was stunned by her gun  
Couldn't walk, couldn't run  
Well she drew me a picture  
And it seemed so true  
Standing on the edge  
And watching my life flash by  
Standing on the edge  
She's lookin' right through my eyes  
  
Love is passin' by  
Right before my eyes  
And I'm wondering why  
What's the reason  
That I'm standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Right here in my face  
I had a vision  
That was bigger than life  
Oh connie likes nighttime, every night  
Connie likes candy, every bite  
All day sucker, connie might  
Swallow that thing 'cause she does it right  
  
I'm weak in the knees  
I'm beggin' you please  
Just ask for more  
She just wants affection  
My soldier's at attention  
No I don't know  
Why you're doin this to me  
Standing on the edge  
And watching my life flash by  
Standing on the edge  
She's lookin' right through my eyes  
  
Love is passin' by  
Right before my eyes  
And I'm wondering why  
What's the reason  
That I'm standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Well she told me  
In the biblical sense  
And she told me  
In the strictest confidence  
  
She told me  
We were worlds apart  
She told me, she told me  
I don't know why I'm here  
She said, "don't be afraid"  
Standing on the edge  
And watching my life flash by  
Standing on the edge  
You're lookin' right through my eyes  
Standing on the edge  
Light flashes before my eyes  
Standing on the edge  
And watchin' my world crash by  
Love is passing by  
Right before my eyes  
And I wonder why  
What's the reason  
That I'm standing on the edge  
  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
Standing on the edge  
I'm standing on the edge


Stiff competition  
If I go up-you take me higher  
Stiff competition  
And when I'm down, you take me higher  
There's stiff competition all over the world  
I screw you, you screw me, they screw us  
  
Here we go again  
Oh, but we have so much fun, so much fun  
When we're together  
When we're together  
When we're together-now  
I looked hard in your eyes  
It was love at first sight  
  
It took me minutes, you're still waiting  
Waiting for your turn, you turn  
It won't be long  
Stiff competition  
I work hard, every day of my life  
  
Stiff competition  
Get it up, you take me higher  
Stiff competition  
All over the world  
The more I get, the more I like it  
The bigger they are, the harder they fall  
  
Again  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition

Now my heart it's breakin'  
You're takin' me back

Pay some attention  
Want to get it right  
Oh how about you  
Mind's under pressure  
Happens every night  
Oh let it go  
  
Love is like a knife  
It cuts deep and wide

Another night slowly closes in and I feel so lonely  
Touching heat freezing on my skin  
I pretend you still hold me  
I'm going crazy I'm losing sleep  
I'm in too far  
I'm in way too deep over you  
I can't believe you're gone  
You were the first  
You'll be the last  
  
[Chorus]  
Wherever you go I'll be with you  
Whatever you want I'll give it to you  
Whenever you need someone  
To lay your heart and head upon  
Remember after the fire After all the rain  
I will be the flame  
I will be the flame  
  
Watching shadows move across the wall  
Feels so frightening  
I want to run to you I want to call  
But I've been hit by lightning  
Just can't stand up for falling apart  
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you  
You'll always be the one  
You were the first  
You'll be the last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm going crazy  
I'm losing sleep  
I'm in too far  
I'm in way too deep over you  
You'll always be the one  
You were the first  
You'll be the last  
  
[Chorus]

Never look back but now never lose sight  
Of your past, oh no  
Change every moment knowing your decisions  
They just won't last, oh no  
  
Well it's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long are the nights  
It feels right turning this time around  
  
Always the danger of falling into  
A mindless shell, oh yeah  
Come out of your shell don't fall into a trap  
You can't get out (can't get out, can't get out)  
  
Well it's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long cold nights  
It feels like turning this time around  
  
When it hurts that bad  
You know my temperature rises  
It never goes down  
It's goin' up  
Straight up  
  
When it hurts that bad  
You know my temperature rises  
It never goes down  
It's goin' up  
Straight up, straight up  
  
Gone are the days  
Long are the nights  
It feels right turning this time around, oh yeah  
  
It's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long are nights  
It feels right turning this time around

You remind a little of a man  
You even resemble his picture  
Oh violins will playing  
On your grave  
  
I saw your crying  
I caught you lieing  
I know you cheated  
Inside you're laughing  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
No sympathy  
For your symphony of lieing  
  
Violins  
They'll be playing playing  
On your grave  
They'll be playing playing  
  
Tell those invited  
Tell those invited  
Our kids was playing  
The band is silent  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
No sympathy  
For your symphony of lieing  
  
Violins  
They'll be playing playing  
On your grave  
They'll be playing playing  
Violins  
They'll be playing playing  
On your grave  
They'll keep playing playing  
  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
I know you cheated  
Inside your laughing  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
So sympathy  
For your symphony of lieing  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
I know you're lieing  
You got me running  
You got me  
You got me  
You really got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You really got me


You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
  
Hey, it's me again  
Plain to see again  
Please can I see you every day  
  
I'm a fool again  
I fell in love with you again  
Please can I see you every day  
  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
  
Words don't come out right  
I try to say it oh so right  
I hope you understand my meaning  
  
Hey, it's me again  
I'm so in love with you again  
Please can I see you every day  
  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
You didn't know what you were lookin' for  
Til you heard the voices in your ear  
  
I remember every word you said  
(Word you said)  
I remember voices in my head  
(In my head)  
I remember ever word you said  
(Word you said)  
  
I heard your voice-it  
Your voice is-cool voices  
Warm voices  
Just what I needed, too  
Words don't seem right  
But its  
Cool voices-warm voices  
Your voice is  
Just what I needed for  
Love is the word-it's  
Warm voices-your voice is  
Cool voices

Your voice is-cool voices  
Warm voices

It's the way of the world...  
Remember you were in school and I followed you home.  
I remember, didn't think I existed but we're comin' together right now.  
I've been runnin', I've been hidin', it's the way of the world.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' 'round.  
  
Remember, I knew I'd be good for you.  
No one better remember, really meant what I said, want to be your lover right
now.  
I've been runnin', I've been hidin', it's the way of the world.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' 'round.  
World goes round, life goes on, and on, and on.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' round.  
  
It's the way of the world.  
  
Remember, you were at work and then Friday at five,  
I remember, felt like a pawn, was I dead or alive?  
I remember, thought no one could hear me, I was goin' insane.  
I remember, it was a real fine line, now you've changed my life around.  
I've been runnin', I've been hidin', it's the way of the world.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' 'round.  
World goes round, life goes on, and on, and on.  
World goes 'round, (i've been runnin')  
World is round (i've been hidin')  
Life goes on and on and on ((it's the way of the world).


How does it feel to be on your own  
While the night slips away  
You toss and turn like a ship in a storm  
Have you lost your way?  
  
I can see by the look in your eyes  
You've been hurt before  
Hold me close like the very first time  
'Cause that's what love is for  
  
There's no reason to cry  
?Cause I'll be there beside you  
When you need someone  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
Sometimes the world can be so cold  
And you just don't know why  
You're reaching out but there's no one to hold  
And times rushin' by  
  
There's no reason to cry  
?Cause I'll be there beside you  
When you need someone  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
When you need someone  
It's a long long day  
When you need someone  
It's a cryin shame  
When you need someone  
You can call out my name  
  
There's no reason to cry  
?Cause I'll be there beside you  
When you need someone  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
When you need someone  
Oh do ya need someone  
  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need someone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
Do you need someone?  
Do you need someone?  
  
I'll stay forever  
Swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need someone  
Please stay forever  
Swear that you'll never be the lonley one  
Don't you need someone?  


When my world is turning  
When it's turning upside down  
When all I see is rain  
When I think the night won't end  
I just think of you  
And I can see the sun again  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
I'd be nowhere, I'd be nowhere  
When the dreams I dream  
All seem a million miles away  
When I'm sure, I'll never win  
When it's looking like  
I've left my faith  
I just look at you baby  
And I got reason to believe again  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Without you to love me  
I'd just be wasting time  
And goin' out of my mind  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you  
Wherever would I be without you, tell me  
If I didn't have you  
Whatever would I do now, baby  
Whatever would I be without you
